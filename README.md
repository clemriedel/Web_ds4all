Welcome to the ds4all github repo. This repo is associated to the website: ds4all.io.

**Natural Language Quantification** permits to find patterns and quantify an amount generated by the patterns. An example is the money generated by topics in the National Science Foundation grants.



NLQ can be applied to any activity described by words and quantified by numbers.

**Topic modeling** permits to find patterns in a corpus of documents composed of structural units. A famous corpus is the scientific publications of the Journal *Science* (documents: articles; structural unit: word). In this example, topic modeling notably permits to draw: **1/**The topics composition in terms of words proportion and **2/** The topic proportion per document. (e.g. this publication is 70% about genetics {'genes', 'dna', 'chrosome'...} and 30% about modelisation {'model', 'computer', algorithm'...}).

**Latent Dirichlet Allocation** --it takes one second to run the command line ([lda package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lda)); and a lifetime to master the power and flexibility of the algorithm.

**Natural language processing skills** are always good to have. We will cover some basic text mining to create an appropriate term document matrix. [Supervised TM (Blei 2007)](Bilibo/Blei2007_SuperivsedTM.pdf)




## Goals

* Gain deeper knowledge on non-deterministic processes.
* Understand when topic modeling can be used (and get familiar with the most common models).
* Choose the appropriate modeling to describe your data.
* Be able to read graph representation and understand how they relate to their modeling.
* Text processing (


## Material
* Install the [lda package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lda).
* If you just have one hour, watch  [Modeling Science](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lda) while following [the slides](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/modeling-science.pdf).
