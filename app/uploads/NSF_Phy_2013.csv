0.468654,"For several microseconds after the big bang the entire universe passed through a phase called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). More than a million times hotter than the sun, the QGP is a form of matter governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where the individual quarks and gluons localized within nucleons are expected to scatter out over distances and times many times larger than a femtometer (fm). Only in the last ten years has it become possible to create and study this form of matter in the laboratory using the fleetingly short-lived nuclear sized droplets of plasma created in the aftermath of a heavy-ion collision. The very short lifetime (10 fm/c, where c is the speed of light) and small size (10 fm) have made the study of this matter a theoretical and experimental challenge. The modification of hard QCD jets (bundles of strongly interacting particles) as they pass through this exotic form of matter presents the best tool to date to study the various properties of the QGP. The goal of the research supported by this grant is to continue to formulate both a systematic and sophisticated approach to the theoretical study of these modified jets. Considerable effort will be directed towards a deeper understanding of the factorization of the hard jet cascade from the soft rescattering experienced by the patrons in the jet, as they propagate through the QGP. Yet another goal will be to numerically simulate the partonic cascade process within the dense medium to better understand the event-by-event characteristics of such modified showers. A third goal will be a rigorous analysis of the data within the framework of perturbative QCD based jet modification to isolate the transport properties of the plasma and place stringent error bars on the extracted transport coefficients of jets in a QGP.<br/><br/>This research, at the intersection of particle and nuclear physics, will greatly enhance our understanding of perturbative and non-perturbative QCD in the complicated environments of a dynamically expanding quark gluon plasma. It will introduce state of the art numerical tools to simulate such processes. It will lead to the training of graduate students in both the sophisticated analytical approaches used as well as the numerical simulation tools used in such efforts. The project also includes an outreach effort to convey the latest results from such analyses as well as from other new cutting edge fields to the general public."
0.465,"This research is devoted to various aspects of many-body theory in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum information theory, and quantum electrodynamics, as well as some related mathematical problems. These various topics have grown out of a body of research over several decades and the underlying unity is that solutions in the various problem areas shed light on each other. The intellectual merit is contained in the following partial list of specific research goals. 1. Building on the recent success in proving the 34 year old conjecture about the Wehrl entropy for spin coherent states, the extension from SU(2) to other Lie groups of interest to mathematics and physics will be investigated. 2. Various topics and conjectures concerning magnetization and long-range order in the Hubbard model of correlated electrons will be investigated. Other problems in condensed matter physics are to understand the binding of polarons and to build models that can be rigorously demonstrated to have striped states. 3. A fundamental statistical-mechanical property of matter is the existence of the thermodynamic limit of the free energy. A proof of this has been only partially accomplished so far when the electromagnetic radiation field is taken into account. It is intended to complete the demonstration. 4. The Lieb-Thirring inequalities are important in a variety of physical and mathematical problems. One goal is to find sharper constants. 5. An attempt will be made to verify the long-standing conjecture that the maximum negative ionization of a large atom is only about one electron. It is very difficult, even with computers, to be sure about ionization of atoms, but nature seems to be telling us about a universal fact about fermions that it would be desirable to understand from first principles. 6. Density functional theory for atoms and molecules is important practically and conceptually. Some open questions about the Muller theory will be investigated, as well as possible improvements to the Lieb-Oxford bound for the exchange- correlation energy that will include the concept of local kinetic energy. 7. Building on previous expertise in the area, the increasingly important field of quantum information theory will be pursued. In particular, the recent success in understanding measures of entanglement as well as the the uncertainty principle for bipartite systems will used to try to solve the bipartite density-matrix reconstruction problem. <br/>A broader impact of this activity is that students and postdocs will be involved in these projects, which will combine mentoring with research and help produce the next generation of mathematically knowledgeable physicists. It will also further the interdisciplinary bonds between the communities of mathematicians and physicists and promote the relevance of modern concepts of mathematical analysis to problems of condensed matter physics."
0.09,"Many important reactions in nuclear physics cannot be measured with currently available experimental techniques. For example, the reaction probability of the process in which two protons fuse to a Deuteron (a bound state of a neutron and a proton) is an important process in the sun. However, it cannot be measured experimentally and only theoretical calculations can provide this rate. In the absence of guidance from experiment, it becomes important to quantify theoretical uncertainties. To address these issues, this project will use analytical and numerical methods to calculate reaction rates for astrophysically relevant reaction rates and new parametrizations of the internuclear interaction that will be useful to the larger nuclear physics community. Specifically, the PI and his students will use nuclear interactions constructed using effective field theory. In this theoretical approach, the nuclear interaction model can be systematically improved to improve the accuracy of the calculation. Intrinsic error of this approach will be determined using numerical techniques. This project will allow not only for a better understanding of important nuclear processes occurring in the universe, but also the project will provide a stimulating training ground for students and postdoctoral fellows and outreach community activities.<br/><br/>This project aims at improving our understanding of electroweak processes using effective field theory. A number of weak processes in few-nucleon systems will be calculated within the unified framework of 'pionless' effective field theory. Specifically, the well-measured decay half-life time of tritium will be studied theoretically in order to obtain a highly accurate description for proton-proton fusion and weak proton capture on Helium-3. Furthermore, the PI and his student will study the intrinsic error of Hamiltonians and associated electroweak currents generated in 'pionfull' effective field theory. The PI will use novel techniques to analyze uncertainties in matrix elements calculated with the chiral potential and the associated electroweak currents in order to account correctly for the intrinsic error of the Hamiltonian order-by-order. With his collaborators, the PI will then use these results to calculate observables such as half-life times or total decay rates that are currently measured to new accuracy and with correct error estimates. The resulting interactions and currents will be made available to the nuclear theory community."
0.14,"This research studies how electrons of an atom or molecule react to intense laser fields and to each other. Strong laser fields are used to study electron dynamics at the attosecond (10^-18 s) timescale for applications such as solar energy conversion and photosynthesis. Previous studies have assumed that only one electron is active in these systems. However, experiments have now shown that the interaction of many electrons, both with each other and with the field must be included. This project will attempt to include these effects. In addition, this project will provide two undergraduate students and one graduate student a broad array of theoretical and computational training. As part of the project, computations that yield useful information on attosecond chemistry will be incorporated into the curriculum for the undergraduate advanced physical chemistry class. Collaborations with experimentalists and quantum chemists involved in the project will contribute to building the connection between conventional spectroscopy and the emerging attosecond chemistry.<br/><br/>The focus of this investigation will be the suppressed ionization of transition metal atoms vanadium, nickel, niobium, palladium, and tantalum in intense laser fields, and spectral features of high harmonic generation (HHG) for argon, nitrogen, and the molecule NO. The features include Cooper minima and HHG enhanced by resonances. There will be extensive benchmarking that consists of comparisons with published results and among different conditions, which will provide insight into the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) approach and methods to improve it as well. The proposed study will render the most probable ion state, the form of the out-going electron wave function, and the time-dependent exchange and correlation potentials. This knowledge will lead to new understanding and improved modeling of strong field many-electron dynamics."
0.618527,"In this work we investigate a new qubit system ideal for realizing an optically connected quantum network: single acceptor-bound holes (A0) in III-V quantum wells (QW). This system has the potential to combine millisecond long spin coherence times with strong, homogeneous optical transitions in a nanofabrication-ready material. Far-field super-resolution optical techniques will be developed in order to isolate single impurity-bound excitons (A0X), with the goal of reaching optical resolutions on the order of the effective mass Bohr radius. These techniques will be combined with ultrafast optical spin control to study the effect of QW confinement and nearby surfaces on the optical and spin coherence properties of the A0-A0X system. Knowledge gained from these studies will guide research on integrating single impurities into optical nanocavities. The longer term goal of the project is to realize optically-connected few qubit devices in a scalable architecture. <br/><br/>A quantum information network based on photons and spins would enable quantum simulation, secure long-distance quantum communication, and quantum computation. In this work we study single impurities in semiconductors as potential quantum bits for such a network. Nanoscale low temperature imaging techniques will be developed to isolate single impurities. Ultrafast optical techniques will be used to study the impurity qubit lifetime. The longer term goal of the project is to realize a few qubit network in which spins are connected through on-chip optical devices. The research program will involve, teach, and train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates in experimental physics, quantum optics, and nanoscience. In addition to training undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs in quantum optics, physics and nanotechnology, an integral part of the broader impact of this program includes community outreach at a local elementary school. University of Washington physics and electrical engineering students, working closely with a Sansislo elementary school science teacher, are engaging 4th-5th grade students in weekly science activites aimed at understanding light."
0.028215,"This award provides support to enable US. students and lecturers to attend the fourth ""Biennial African School on Fundamental Physics and its Applications"" in Kigali, Rwanda 1-19 August 2016. The schools are based on a close interplay between theoretical, experimental, and applied physics, and Grid computing. They cover a wide range of topics: particle physics, particle detectors, astro-particle physics and cosmology, computing, accelerator technologies, medical physics, condensed matter, light sources and their applications. The participating students are selected from all over Africa and beyond. Scientists from Africa, Europe and the USA are invited to prepare and deliver lectures taking into account the diverse levels of the students. The duration of the school allows for networking -- interactions among students and between students and lecturers. <br/><br/>This effort will expand the scope of existing collaborations; bringing more African, American and European researchers and students together. An explicit goal of this School is to promote collaboration with Africa. US students and faculty will be involved.<br/>This proposal significantly leverages the support of domestic and international organizations including: the NSF (MPS/PHY division and OISE), ICTP, IN2P3, INFN, CERN, DESY, Brookhaven and other National Laboratories and the American Physical Society."
0.18,"This project seeks answers to two of the overarching questions central to nuclear physics: ""How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge?"", and ""Are the fundamental interactions that are basic to the structure of matter fully understood?"". The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is successful at describing interactions of elementary particles, but it is known to be incomplete, because the SM fails to describe phenomena that shape our universe, like the difference between matter and anti-matter or the nature of dark matter. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which the strong force binds three light elementary particles, quarks, to make massive composite particles, proton and neutrons, are not well understood quantitatively. Over ninety nine percent of the mass of the visible matter in the universe is generated by the strong force in this way. In this context, the PIs are involved in two experimental programs using the electron beam at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, first to investigate the internal structure of the proton as a means of investigating the nature of the strong force, and second to search for physics beyond the Standard Model by performing precision measurements of interactions with precise Standard Model predictions. The PIs will train two graduate students and undergraduate students in carrying out the research program, and will engage in STEM outreach activities through the ""Adopt a physicist"" program. <br/><br/>This project will support in part the use of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering of electrons from the proton to produce a 3-D tomographic picture of the internal structure of the proton against which models of the strong force can be tested. Roche is one of the spoke persons for experiment E12-06-114 at JLab, and this project will support the data taking and data analysis for this experiment. The immediate goal of this experiment is to test the hypothesis of scaling on which the Generalized Parton Distribution formalism used to interpret this kind of experiments is based. The second project supported by this award will further the involvement of the PIs and their students in the JLab parity violating electron scattering experiments, QWEAK and MOLLER. These experiments test the Standard Model by studying the electromagnetic and weak forces in electron-proton and electron-electron scattering. The PIs will continue their work with QWEAK up to publication of the final results, and will use their expertise in data acquisition and software development for the preparation of the MOLLER experiment."
0.16,"The research goals of this project are focused on understanding the strong-field regime of Einstein's theory of general relativity. This encompasses both astrophysical and theoretical aspects of general relativity. On the astrophysical side, the main effort is numerical simulations of binary black hole, black hole-neutron star and binary neutron star collisions. This is important to support the field of gravitational wave astronomy recently ushered in by LIGO's detection of the collision of two black holes. Numerical models of such sources are needed to aid in detection, and are crucial to decipher details of observed signals. On the theoretical side, there are many outstanding questions about the nature of spacetime in extreme situations. The one that will be the main focus here is the ultra-relativistic limit of black hole collisions; namely, what happens when two black holes collide at the speed of light. Speculation about the outcome began in the 1960's when Penrose used this scenario to help formulate his cosmic censorship conjecture, stating all singularities in spacetime are hidden behind event horizons. Numerical methods are now giving us the tools to definitively tackle this regime of general relativity. The pursuit of these projects will involve graduate students, undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows. They will be trained to do leading scientific research, become knowledgeable in corresponding areas of physics, and adept in high-performance computing and numerical methods. These skills are invaluable to many professions, and would thus also benefit and further the development of those students and postdocs that subsequently wish to pursue careers outside academia.<br/><br/>A specific list of gravitational wave source modeling projects that will be pursued are (1) understanding the consequences of neutron star spin in binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, (2) improving estimates of heavy element yields and corresponding electromagnetic counterpart emission in collisions involving neutron stars when there is significant ejected material, (3) beginning to include neutrino and radiation transport, and improving our models of magnetic fields in our evolution code, relevant for mergers involving neutron stars, (4) continued development of the parameterized post Einsteinian (ppE) framework for eccentric binaries to allow such events, if observed, to be used to test general relativity, and (5) explore binary mergers in alternative theories of gravity and/or exotic alternatives to black holes within general relativity (such as boson stars), to allow the merger event recently detected by LIGO and future detections to constrain/rule-out/discover these alternatives. Regarding the ultra-relativistic collision problem, the route to approaching this limit will be by developing a code to study the collision of distributions of null dust. Such distributions can be tailored to approach both the point-particle and plane-parallel wave collision limits in a non-singular manner amenable to full numerical treatment."
0.3,"With the discovery of gravitational waves in September 2015, the LIGO collaboration is beginning a new scientific adventure by the exploration of the cosmos with gravitational waves. The Oregon group played an important role in the discovery. It is responsible for the large array of sensors which measure potential underlying terrestrial contributions to the gravitational wave signals, for example from ground motion, ambient magnetic or radio-frequency fields, acoustic noise, etc. This work will continue to be crucial over the next three years of this award, as LIGO expects to detect many gravitational-wave signals, perhaps arising from a wide variety of astrophysical sources. In fact, the other key contribution of the Oregon group is the search for one class of such sources - those associated with gamma-ray bursts. The discovery sparked tremendous public interest, reflecting the public appetite for the exploration of our universe. The publication of the scientific results from this research program has already contributed to advancement of other scientific disciplines, most notably astronomy. Finally, the education of the graduate students and postdoctoral associates working on the project will advance the technical workforce.<br/><br/><br/>The Oregon group has been a key player in developing the readiness of the LIGO detectors and its associated scientific program. Starting with the earliest data taking with initial LIGO, the group has made key contributions in the areas of characterization of detector background noise and in the data analysis techniques involving associated astrophysical signals. Specifically, on the instrument side, they have learned how to characterize the coupling of all known sources of environmental disturbances with gravitational-wave detection, and to monitor these couplings. Here, ""environment"" corresponds to any external influence other than gravitational waves. This allows LIGO to make clear statements about the potential contributions of such disturbances to putative gravitational-wave detections. On the data analysis side, the Oregon group has pioneered the science program which searches for transient gravitational-wave signals associated with astrophysical events which are well localized in time and sky position, and which are potential GW sources. These external ""triggers"" include gamma rays from GRBs, x-ray bursts from magnetars, and neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae."
0.259279,"This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site will provide 12 undergraduate physics majors from across the country with a ten-week long genuine research project emphasizing one-to-one mentoring with faculty from a wide range of disciplines within the Purdue University Department of Physics. Interactions with the community of scientists is emphasized with a interdisciplinary science seminar series, two required public talks on their research, a poster at a general Purdue-wide undergraduate research conference, tours of Purdue scientific facilities including the unique Brick nanotechnology center, field trips to national facilities at Fermilab and Argonne, and the REU Olympics at Notre Dame University, plus various social activities. The weekly seminar initiated and hosted by Physics Department combines Physics REU participants with students from other Purdue summer sites (REU & SURF at Biology, Chemistry, Engineering etc.) to emphasize interdisciplinary opportunities and interactions among students across many fields. Similar objectives are desired for two RET participants, whose research activities will be reflected in their subsequent classroom teaching, inspiring their own students about careers in research.<br/><br/>The participants in this REU and RET program will collaborate with their mentors and other researchers to advance diverse state-of-the-art areas of physics, such as: nanophysics of electrons in reduced dimensional conductors, the dynamical behavior in proteins, the quantum mechanisms of photosynthesis, single molecule/protein dynamic imaging, the use of cosmogenic nuclei as chronometers in geoscience, coherent imaging of tumors, particle detectors with improved hardness and resolution, detectors for TeV radiation, investigation of dark matter, novel application of nuclear detectors for sensing hazardous materials, properties of graphene, applications of biofilms in seismic measurements, the fundamental nature of nuclear decay, enhanced long-baseline imaging for radio astronomy, seismic propagation in structures of geologic interest, the quantum nature of bird magnetoreception, analysis of data collected by scientists at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and other current topics of importance."
0.120001,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Rouzbeh Allahverdi at the University of New Mexico Department of Physics and Astronomy. <br/><br/>We know from observations that only 15% of the matter in the universe is described by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, while 85% is made of Dark Matter (DM). However, the nature and origin of DM remains as one of the most profound problems at the interface of particle physics and cosmology. The successful running of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has put us on the verge of discovering new physics beyond the SM. This, combined with a whole array of direct and indirect detection experiments, will help us discover the DM and establish its particle physics origin. The complementary information provided by these experiments will also play a crucial role in shedding light on the cosmological history of the early universe. The research funded by this award will be to help establish the nature of Dark Matter by using complementary signals from different experiments, and to determine its origin. It will also study the reason for the numerical coincidence that the amount of visible matter and dark matter are not too different, and will study possible interactions between Dark Matter and neutrinos. The research funded by this award will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Allahverdi will involve graduate and undergraduate students in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field. The PI will additionally outreach his results to a broader audience by giving public lectures and visiting schools.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award has a three-fold goal. First, by using complementary signals from different experiments to determine the thermal or non-thermal origin of DM. In several extensions of the SM, the DM is produced non-thermally. Second, to investigate models that can address the baryon-DM coincidence puzzle, since in general the densities of baryons and DM can be widely different (since they are produced at very different epochs). Third, to probe possible connections between the DM and neutrinos, including possible sensitivity to the Dirac or Majorana nature of neutrinos. To achieve these objectives, Professor Allahverdi studies various particle physics models of DM in light of data from indirect detection searches, and examines their testable predictions for collider and direct detection experiments. These investigations will help determine the deeper theoretical origin of the DM sector and its embedding within a fundamental theory. They will also enable us to use DM as a window to the thermal history of the universe when it was a tiny fraction of a second old. This is far earlier than that provided by current observational probes, namely the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)."
0.15,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Surjeet Rajendran at the University of California, Berkeley. Physical laws often lead to new particles through which their effects are manifested on the natural world. For example, we experience the electric force because of the existence of particles like the electron and the proton that carry electric charge, with the force between them carried by the photon. Searches for particles is thus a fruitful way to discover new fundamental forces. It is important to search for such fundamental forces since they have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of the origins of the laws of nature. They may also potentially enable us to interact with the natural world in dramatically new ways, potentially permitting advances as remarkable as the effects of electromagnetism on our daily lives. Many models of fundamental physics predict the existence of particles that have very small masses and also have very weak interactions with our world. In some cases, these particles can also be the dark matter of the universe. Their weak interactions can be overcome either with large systems or through precision technology. This project develops methods that use large astrophysical objects such as millisecond pulsars as well as precision laboratory techniques to significantly expand our reach into the parameter space of such particles.<br/><br/>Professor Rajendran will develop new experimental approaches to detect ultra-light particles that interact very weakly with the standard model such as axions and dark photons. Such particles naturally emerge in many frameworks of physics beyond the standard model, and may even be the dark matter of the universe. The methods developed by Professor Rajendran include the use of the existence of the super-radiant instability of rotating systems to argue that the existence of certain kinds of light particles would cause the rapid spin-down of millisecond pulsars. Observations of such pulsars can therefore constrain these particles. Professor Rajendran will point out qualitatively new effects of dark photons emerging from their longitudinal modes. These effects have been overlooked in the literature and by incorporating them, he will show how existing experiments can parametrically extend their reach into the parameter space of such models. These gains also extend to the case where such dark photons constitute the dark matter of the Universe and he will invent techniques tailored to detect such dark matter. Professor Rajendran will also show how current experimental methodologies that have been developed to search for fundamental sources of CPT violation or a cosmologically preferred direction can also be used to search for certain kinds of light dark matter. The dark matter signal can be qualitatively different from the signals typically expected in these experiments and may permit ways to overcome the systematic limitations of such experiments. With the increasing costs of collider experiments, the future of particle physics may lie as much in non-collider experiments that can probe such hidden sectors that lie far in the ultra-violet."
0.171351,"A host of problems in scientific research, security, and commerce involve events registered by many devices in multiple locations. The result is fragmented information that must be gathered and built into a coherent whole. In addition, these events may come in rapid succession. When the event rate is high and the number of fragments large, the problem comes to resemble that of assembling tens, hundreds or even thousands of puzzle pieces that are continually being dumped into a common container. Further, puzzle pieces can become damaged or lost, introducing errors into the puzzle assembly process. These challenges are well-studied in the field of computational (nanoscale) self-assembly, which models processes such as the growth of crystals from organic molecules in solution. This project adapts computational self-assembly models to create a new paradigm that treats pieces of information from multiple sensors like molecules randomly meeting and assembling in solution. The result is a dynamic, fluid database of information chunks that evolve over time to form complete, accurate associations. This approach is applied to assemble data from the telescope arrays of very-high-energy gamma-ray observatories. A successful proof of concept in this domain is of interest to more than high-energy astrophysicists. The methods developed here are relevant to high data-volume experiments in other areas of physics and may have further applications to data transport and mining problems in the economic and security sectors. <br/><br/>This radically different method of fault-tolerant association of information from distributed sensors requires a proof-of-concept study, which will take place over a two-year period. The chosen test case is scientific. Very-high-energy gamma rays and cosmic rays initiate showers of charged particles in Earth's atmosphere, which in turn produce light due to an effect known as Cherenkov radiation. Arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes sample the light from a shower from multiple directions in order to more accurately infer the origin and energy of a given gamma ray. Assembling data from these telescopes into a description of a single gamma- or cosmic-ray shower (event-building) is typically done only once. Since revisiting the event-building process is impractical for a large (up to 100 petabytes per year) volume of data, errors become frozen into the data archive. This problem is addressed by the algorithmic self-assembly paradigm. Real and simulated data from the operating gamma-ray observatory VERITAS and simulated data from a planned next-generation observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), are used to develop the concept and iteratively design, prototype, and test simple implementations for these instruments. Novel signal processing techniques will be exploited to rapidly extract information used in the association process. A series of use-case-dependent benchmarks are used to assess the performance. CTA's size, roughly 100 telescopes distributed over a square kilometer, and high (30 gigabytes per second) data rates make it a particularly apt test case and a successful proof of concept could lead to adoption of this model by CTA."
0.42,"This award will fund theoretical and experimental efforts on critical issues related to developing a new class of advanced particle accelerators based on exotic new materials: metamaterials of photonic matter. Metamaterials are artificial materials usually assembled from conventional microscopic materials. Photonic matter in this context is a new state of matter in which photons interact with each other, usually through mutual interactions with ordinary atoms. The metamaterials of photonic matter in this award will be used to advance techniques in particle accelerators. By taking advantage of highly unusual propagation properties of high-frequency electromagnetic waves in metamaterials, this award will develop both beam-driven (two-beam) and wave-driven accelerators utilizing highly unorthodox propagation geometries that will ultimately lead to developing high frequency switched matrix accelerators capable of overcoming the most severe challenge to high gradient acceleration: the breakdown of the accelerating structures<br/><br/>This research brings together two areas of science: electromagnetics/metamaterials and accelerators. Graduate students will be involved in all stages of this project. Significant outreach effort to high school, undergraduate, and graduate Hispanic students in Texas is planned. High school students from local schools will conduct summer research in the PI's laboratories, collaborate with graduate students, and receive mentorship from the recently established Mentorship Networks among minority students in the San Antonio/Austin area aimed at enhancing the interest and awareness of nanoscale science among minority students. The Mentorship Network has been established through the NSF's Nanotechnology Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) grant to UT-San Antonio/UT-Austin. One of the supported graduate students will have the opportunity to spend considerable time at Argonne National Laboratory and at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET) facility testing these novel accelerating structures using short ultra-relativistic beams.<br/><br/>The intellectual focus of this work is the design, fabrication, and experimentally testing accelerating structures that support luminous electromagnetic waves capable of strongly interacting with ultra-relativistic electron beams.

All accelerating structures will be tested at facilities at Argonne National Laboratory and at SLAC, with particular emphasis on structural breakdown at high accelerating gradients and on techniques needed for short wavelength operation."

0.6,"Nature has intrinsic handedness because of the weak interaction, but the difference between the left- and right-handed cases is barely discernible in atomic and nuclear interactions. Understanding its strength in nuclei is possible through measurements that require francium atoms so cold that they barely move. They show the effects of the handedness, from the anapole moment, when they are set to oscillate, and their frequency of oscillation changes with the handedness. The researchers will study the weak interaction, the force responsible for the beginning of the solar cycle, inside the francium nucleus. The atoms, made in the accelerator at TRIUMF Vancouver Canada, will be held on a laser trap, excited with microwaves and generate signals that show the handedness of nature.<br/><br/>This international effort, with active participants from the USA, Canada, and Mexico, as well as Australia and China, is an example of multinational collaboration that is enabling investigations at the frontier of physics. The research will allow US graduate and undergraduate students to obtain valuable global perspectives in science, and be educated in the boundary between atomic molecular and optical physics and nuclear physics. In addition, undergraduates from Mexico, through a program with the Sociedad Mexicana de Fisica, will participate in the summer at TRIUMF.

0.53,"Technical description:<br/>This award supports a program of research in experimental hadronic physics by the Arizona State University Meson Physics Group which will yield information crucial to achieving a better understanding of how hadrons are composed of quarks by providing a large data set detailing the excitation spectra of key two- and three-quark systems. In particular, the Meson Physics Group at Arizona State University will study the excitations of the nucleon, Cascade, and Omega baryons, as well as the excitations of gluonic flux tubes within mesons. The polarization data that the group will provide for the nucleon are essential for addressing one of the NSAC/OMB milestones for hadronic physics, and the ASU group is uniquely positioned to provide that data. The group is also participating in a conditionally approved experiment that will use the CLAS12 detector under construction at Jefferson Lab to produce and discover excited baryon states of the Cascade and Omega using quasi-real incident photons. The data to be obtained will further detail the excitations of three-quark systems and complements work being done by the group on excited nucleons. The Meson Physics Group at Arizona State University also will work with the GlueX detector, currently under construction in Hall D at Jefferson Lab, in order to search gluonic excitations within mesons of masses up to 2.5 GeV. The ASU group will assume primary responsibility for building a triplet polarimeter to directly measure the Hall D photon beam polarization. The results of these investigations will be broadly disseminated through conference presentations and refereed publications, and will be archived in public databases.<br/><br/>Broader significance and importance:<br/>No comprehensive theoretical description of how the nucleus of the atom is built from quarks can be achieved without a solid knowledge of the excited states. The data obtained from Arizona State University Meson Physics Group will further inform and test theoretical models used to understand the structure of matter that is comprised of quarks. In addition to potential discoveries in, and advancement of, the understanding of nuclear physics, the work to be supported will provide instruction and mentoring in science and technology to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as to a postdoctoral research associate. The triplet polarimeter to be built will enhance the precision reached for experiments conducted in Hall D at JLab as well as those using the photon beam at Mainz, resulting in important improvements in the infrastructure of those laboratories."
0.165,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. <br/><br/>There have been hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos, and clarifying these ""hints"" is one of the main thrusts of this project. The work itself will be the further development of the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology for use in neutrino physics as part of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) experiment and the MicroBooNE experiment. These neutrino experiments are all located at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). The MicroBooNE experiment should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether predicted ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments. In addition to the contribution to the fundamental neutrino physics mentioned above, this research will serve as an invaluable proving ground for the calibration, reconstruction and analysis techniques that will be needed to make future experiments, such as the planned DUNE experiment, a success.<br/><br/>The Broader Impact of the project involves bringing current techniques in high energy physics to the broader local community. The south side neighborhoods surrounding the UChicago campus are largely populated with underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and this project aims to build a program within the Department of Physics that connects university students with local elementary and middle school children to introduce them to concepts in physics with the aid of fun, interactive demonstrations."
0.32,"Research in Fundamental Nuclear and Particle Physics is being categorized in three areas: At the ""Energy Frontier"", physicists hope to discover new physics, e.g. new symmetries or particles, by colliding particles with increasingly high energy. At the ""Cosmic Frontier"", physicists use the cosmos as a laboratory that contains detectable information about new physics. And finally, at the ""Precision Frontier"", physicists attempt to measure quantities that are believed to be known very precisely, and to interpret deviations from the known physics predictions as a signal for new physics. This award supports a measurement of the third type, a precision measurement of several observables in free neutron beta decay which serve to better understand the fundamental interactions between elementary particles. The process of beta decay has been incorporated into the standard model of elementary particle physics, which gives us a successful description of elementary particle processes. A discovery of new physics would have a critical impact on Nuclear and High Energy Physics, and on Cosmology. Being on the forefront of scientific research and on the edge of what is technologically feasible, the project will serve as a training ground for future generations of scientists. Most of the research will be done by students at the undergraduate and graduate level. <br/><br/>This grant supports the effort to design, construct, commission, and operate the Nab spectrometer. The spectrometer will use the state of the art neutron beamline (FNPB) at the new Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in Oak Ridge, TN to determine the two-dimensional energy distribution of decay electron and protons in neutron beta decay. The redundancy inherent in the standard model description of the neutron beta decay process allows uniquely sensitive checks of the model's validity and limits, with strong implications in astrophysics. One of the expected observables, the determination of the neutrino-electron-correlation coefficient with a relative uncertainty of 0.1%, will allow an extraction of Vud, the upper left element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, in order to test its unitarity. The current NSAC long range plan finds that ""The only realistic way to improve Vud is via neutron decay."" New results from high energy physics cast a shadow on the unitarity of the CKM matrix, and re-open the possibility of finding hints for new exchange bosons, or a fourth quark generation. The other observable, the determination of the Fierz term, which parametrizes a deviation from the known shape of the spectrum of the decay electrons, to about 0.001, allows finding new particles that mediate scalar or tensor interactions at low energy, in a complementary way and with sensitivity competitive to what is expected from LHC."
0.351232,"Atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics is a fundamental science that has contributed to some of the most significant scientific and technical advances of the last century, including the invention and understanding of the laser, atomic clocks, and the creation of new types of matter. Applications connected to the core of AMO physics are found in abundance in navigation (GPS and atomic clocks), medicine (lasers, MRI, imaging), and global internet communication (optical fibers). AMO Physics is also an enabling discipline connecting with several areas of science in condensed matter physics, chemistry, astrophysics, plasma and nuclear physics, and biology. With a new quantum revolution underway, spurred by remarkable advances in exquisite precision and control of interactions between atomic species and manipulation and study of the coherent properties of light and matter, a center of excellence in AMO theory will serve as the integrator of activities in helping lead this revolution in quantum technologies. This newly-established theoretical center (ITAMP) will serve a broad community of physicists in the United States.<br/><br/>ITAMP at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, MA will serve as the meeting place for novel and innovative ideas, and in which highly motivated theoretical physicists interact in close proximity to experimentalists, visiting fellows and faculty working on broadly defined topics in AMO physics, and flourish in the larger AMO physics ecosystem in Cambridge. ITAMP will strive to be an incubator facility for theoretical AMO physics by providing resources and access to the rich AMO-related ecosystem of excellence in Cambridge, such as the NSF PFC- Center for Ultracold Atoms at Harvard and MIT- to create a collaborative environment for the visiting fellows and for the training and mentoring of junior fellows, to broadly advocate for the field, and to lead in forefront research in AMO physics and outreach efforts to the community. ITAMP will hold and host targeted topical group meetings in which large groups of practitioners will gather in critical mass to mount coordinated attacks on topical challenges in AMO physics and find novel solutions to these problems. Postdoctoral fellows and students will benefit from proximity to these recognized figures in theoretical and experimental AMO science. Visiting fellows, housed in a contiguous office environment, will interact with the postdoctoral and scientific fellows in ways not otherwise possible. Winter Graduate Schools will be scheduled to train students keen in learning fundamental and advanced topics in AMO physics."
0.15,"Molecular and atomic ""anions"" are microscopic particles formed when an electron collides and attaches to a molecule or an atom. Anions play an important role in various environments and have many applications in technology and fundamental research. Among these applications are not only common products such as smoke detectors, but also much more sophisticated devices, including fusion reactors (devices that transform the mass of light atoms into into electricity and which may be a major source of clean energy for the second half of the 21st century). Anions play an important role in semiconductor technology and have important implications for the space industry since they have been found in interstellar space and the atmospheres of large planets. Despite its importance and many uses, the formation of anions is poorly understood. This is because the process involving collisions of electrons with molecules is difficult to describe theoretically. In some situations, it is possible to overcome the lack of theoretical understanding by doing the appropriate experiments. However, experiments are expensive, especially if no theoretical guidance is available. An example is the use of anions in plasmas, where experiments are expensive because of the extreme temperatures needed for fusion to occur. The aim of this research is to understand and model the process of molecular anion formation in relation to the interstellar medium, planetary atmospheres, and technology development. The proposed research program is a cross disciplinary effort involving astrophysics, planetary science, and plasma physics. The project will answer the question of how observed molecular anions are formed in cold plasmas (such as in the interstellar medium or upper atmosphere of planets) and also how fast they are formed and destroyed. The project will develop theoretical methods that could be used by the scientific community to study other similar processes. <br/><br/>This project addresses a number of atomic and molecular physics problems related to elementary processes in molecular plasmas. Molecular plasma evolution and decay are governed by collisions between electrons and molecules (or molecular ions). Understanding such elementary processes is important in studies of laboratory plasmas, planetary atmospheres, and the interstellar medium (ISM). It also allows one to develop tools for modeling, monitoring, and controlling plasmas, which is crucial for technological applications such as semiconductor etching or tokamak plasma wall protection in the divertor region. The project is mainly devoted to the study of the formation of negative molecular ions by radiative electron attachment (REA) and dissociative electron attachment (DEA). The study is motivated by a recent detection of negative ions CnH- (n=4,6,8) and CnN- (n=1,3,5) in the ISM. It was suggested that these ions (except, maybe, CN-) are formed in the ISM by REA. Recently, a fully-quantum method to calculate the REA rate coefficients was developed in the group and applied to study REA in CN-. A very low rate coefficient for REA formation of CN- was found. For larger molecular ions, the fully-quantum method will likely give rate coefficients that are also small, which would mean that the observed ISM abundance of the ions cannot be explained by REA. One goal of the project is to adapt the developed fully-quantum method to other observed molecular ions: The REA mechanism of negative ion formation will be studied using first principles. It is likely that results of this study will lead to a revision of the accepted mechanisms of anion formation in the ISM. Later, the developed methods will be applied to study several problems in the chemistry of anions and cations in the interstellar medium, planetary atmospheres, and laboratory plasmas. In particular, the question of whether the dissociative or radiative mechanism of anion formation in the ISM is more efficient will be addressed. The project will contribute to the development of plasma-related databases, in particular, those used for modeling magnetic fusion devices, planetary atmospheres, spacecraft re-entry, and interstellar medium."
23.075,"The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP), located on the Santa Barbara campus of the University of California (UCSB), serves the diverse goals of theoretical physics via a unique mode of operation and structure. The combination of visiting research programs with a small permanent faculty and postdoctoral fellows enables interactions among visiting scientists to occur with lasting impact. As a largely peer-managed institute, with essential input in the planning and implementation of its research programs from the community, the KITP responds to new scientific opportunities, encourages transformational research, and promotes diversity by ensuring broad representation. The programs, which attract select groups of participants from institutions worldwide, are designed to enhance interaction and collaboration among participants in order to stimulate the vibrant, creative thinking that leads to insight and significant scientific progress. The KITP strives to reach out to new scientific communities and to foster inter-disciplinary research, at the crossroads between Physics and allied fields, such as Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, and Mathematics.<br/><br/>The research programs of the KITP cover all the traditional areas of theoretical physics: Condensed Matter Physics, Astrophysics, High-Energy and Particle Physics, String Theory and Mathematical Physics, Atomic Physics and Optics, Gravitational Physics and Relativity, as well as Biological Physics. The Advisory Board chooses KITP programs with a 1.5-2 year lead time, in response to proposals submitted by the community. The Board, which rotates membership on a three year cycle, is broadly representative of the national physics community, and is instrumental in conveying to the Institute the desires, the suggestions and the complaints of the community, as well as serving as a pool of potential organizers for programs. The choice of programs is dictated by the excellence of the science, the potential for successful advances, the timing of the program and the potential for synergy with programs running in parallel. Special attention is given to programs that span different fields, such as Atomic and Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Information and Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Field Theory and Mathematics, Biology. and Physics, and Climate Science. Almost all NSF funds are used to support the expenses of the visitors, the infrastructure of the programs and the KITP postdocs. In a typical year, the Institute runs 8-12 research programs, lasting 1-6 months long. At any given time there are two or three overlapping programs, with about 20-25 visitors resident in each program. This results in more than 1000 visitors per year and a total of approximately 23,000 visitor-days per year.<br/><br/>The Institute offers an exciting experience for young theorists. Postdoctoral fellows are exposed to more different aspects of theory and to more scientists than at any other institution, providing unique opportunities to develop broad perspectives and begin independent research. The Graduate Fellows program offers an opportunity for advanced graduate students matriculated elsewhere to spend 5-6 months participating in KITP activities and broadening their grasp of physics. Participating scientists at KITP can bring their students with them as Affiliates. All in all, there are about 10-20 graduate students at the KITP at any given time. In order to bring forefront physics to as large an audience as possible, the KITP has developed a web site that covers all Institute activities. Audio recordings, transparencies, PowerPoint, web-cam images, computer graphics, and video of all talks, seminars and the four yearly public lectures are posted on the Web. This archive now contains over 10,000 talks, and receives over 95,000,000 hits per year (including over 30 million hits on the public lectures), resulting in over 73,500 hours of audio streamed to the world. All program talks are recorded and all conference talks are put on the Web in almost real time. A Journalist-in-Residence program (supported by private funds) enables communicators of science to come to KITP for insight into what theoretical physicists are thinking and doing, and to share with interested scientists tips about communicating science. The KITP Scholars program supports the research efforts of faculty not working at major research institutions by funding two-week annual visits to KITP. The annual spring Secondary School Teachers conference brings teachers from around the United States to participate in talks and discussions on a topic associated with one of the concurrently running scientific programs."

0.13,"The main science goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of physical processes that occur before, during, and after the eruption of arched magnetic field structures on the Sun that are filled with plasma, a hot gas of electrons and ions. The solar atmosphere is a chaotic stew of such arched magnetoplasma structures that cover broad spatial and temporal scales. The tiny ones are the size of California; the Earth would be barely noticeable inside a big one. The arched magnetoplasma structures efficiently confine plasma until they become unstable and erupt. Some of these eruptions drive extremely intense energetic events that influence systems and technologies in orbit and on Earth. To get insight into the eruption processes, highly reproducible arched magnetoplasma eruptions will be generated and studied in a laboratory experiment at UCLA. In addition, collaborative efforts between plasma and solar physicists will be initiated to enhance the impact of this project in broader areas of physics. This project will also provide educational opportunities to high-school students and train a graduate student towards his/her doctorate.<br/><br/>Contemporary models of solar eruptions attempt to explain initiation and evolution of arched magnetoplasma structures on the Sun. It is difficult to test these models by solely relying on constraints provided by remote observations, especially since key elements (such as magnetic-field and plasma flow in the corona) are not directly measured. In this project, a series of specially designed laboratory plasma experiments will be conducted to simulate the eruption of arched magnetoplasma structures under a variety of scenarios on the Sun. These experiments will provide data with a high spatio-temporal resolution in three dimensions and will have the flexibility of testing a variety of models of solar eruptions, such as dynamic injection of magnetic flux into an arched magnetoplasma and slow-storage of magnetic energy driving a fast eruption. The arched magnetoplasma will evolve in a large background plasma produced by another source. Thousands of identical eruptions will be routinely produced and their evolution will be recorded using movable diagnostic probes and a fast CCD camera. To complement these studies, remote observational results on solar eruptions will be compared with the laboratory results for few selective cases. These research efforts are expected to contribute to a wide range of topics relevant to the Sun such as coronal mass ejections, loss of equilibrium due to force imbalance in an arched flux rope, and excitation of waves and oscillations in the solar atmosphere."
0.200002,"Gravitational Wave Astronomy promises to provide a revolutionary new view of the universe that can probe previously unexplored regions, including the interiors of neutron stars, collisions of black holes, which emit energy at luminosities exceeding the entire visible universe, and even remnants of the big bang. To gain new insight into the dynamics of the universe, gravitational wave astronomers need to be able to infer the nature of the sources from the observed signals. The physical parameters of these sources can be extracted from the observed signals if the dependence of the waveform on source parameters is known to sufficiently high accuracy. The success of the gravitational wave astronomy efforts therefore depends critically on advancements in Numerical Relativity, especially now that aLIGO is online.<br/><br/>The principal goals supported by this award are to produce waveforms for aLIGO source parameterization efforts, and to model the remnant mass, spin, luminosity, and gravitational recoil from highly-precessing spinning black hole binaries (BHBs) in order to elucidate their distributions, and also how recoils affect the distribution and growth of supermassive black holes. This research will also complement other ongoing projects of the RIT group aimed at studying electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to compact-object mergers and to model accretion disk dynamics near supermassive black holes via the inclusion of matter and EM fields in BHBs spacetimes."
0.1,"The detection by Advanced LIGO of a gravitational wave signal on September 14, 2015 heralds the beginning of a new branch of astronomy. This award supports research to enhance the sensitivity of searches for transient gravitational wave signals by improving the algorithms used to tease faint gravitational wave signals out of the instrument noise, and to provide detailed information about the physical characteristics of the signals so that we can connect them to possible astrophysical sources. The proposed research will build upon the BayesWave algorithm that was developed under two predecessor awards. BayesWave separates gravitational wave burst signals from the pops and crackles of the instrument noise. The BayesWave analysis helped confirm the first detection of gravitational waves, and results from the analysis can be found in the first figure of the discovery paper. The LIGO project presents young researchers and students with a wonderful opportunity to participate in the birth of a new observation science that is poised to make discoveries that will revolutionize astronomy and deliver unique insights into some of the Universe's most exotic phenomena. The MSU research program offers tremendous opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The blend of creative activities associated with the development of sophisticated and innovative data analysis techniques, combined with hands on exposure to running existing search pipelines and working with production level computer code, will provide excellent training for the next generation of gravitational wave astronomers. These skills are transferable and highly sought after in other fields. The MSU group has been very active in bringing gravitational wave science to the public through talks, a school lecture program, and the production of a documentary. The group plans to produce new web-based educational resources that illustrate the signal processing techniques used in their research by applying them to related problems in auditory signal analysis.<br/><br/>The supported work will improve and extend the BayesWave algorithm in several ways, including the development of targeted searches for specific signals, providing new functionality in the extraction of physical information about the signal that can aid in the identification of the source, and developing a low-latency capability. The new directed searches will target the post-merger signals from neutron star binaries, burst-trains from high eccentricity systems, and the late inspiral, merger and ringdown of high mass black hole binaries. The physically parameterized models used in these targeted analyses will allow us to produce estimates for quantities such as the masses, spins, and radii of the compact objects. For signals from unknown sources it is important to thoroughly characterize the signal to make connection with possible astrophysical models for the source. To this end, the group will develop new tools to extract information about the time-frequency development of the signal, and related measures such as rise and decay times. A low-latency version of the algorithm will provide a new frontline search capability that will compliment, and give redundancy to, the existing burst search pipelines."
0.121663,"This award supports two experimental investigations into the physics of musical instruments. The two projects represent complex problems involving energy transfer between vibrating structures and the air flow that produces the vibration. One goal is to determine if the vibration of the tubing of brass wind instruments in the direction of the air flow is the primary reason that the material and bracing of the instrument affects the sound. If this is found to be the case, it will answer a question that has been debated in the scientific literature for over a century. The second goal is to determine the physical parameters of a reed that are necessary to construct an accurate model of a clarinet during actual performance. The results of this study will enhance the ability to synthesize the sound of woodwind instruments and provide needed information concerning which parameters musical instrument designers should be adjusting to improve their instruments.<br/><br/> The primary goal of the work is to involve undergraduate students, particularly women, in original scientific research. While the systems under study involve musical instruments, the research centers on studying basic physical phenomena that are not unique to musical acoustics. This work contributes to the understanding of some important physics, with both scientific and industrial applications, but more importantly it introduces undergraduate students to original scientific research through a subject they find fascinating."
0.165,"The encapsulation of an atom or a cluster of atoms, or even a smaller fullerene (buckyball made of carbon atoms) inside a larger fullerene cage offers a unique molecular-level laboratory in which to examine the behavior of the guest system in sub-nanometer to nanometer (1 billionth of a meter) size confinements. Studies of these so called endofullerenes can not only lead to intriguing effects at the atomic scale but also can probe processes within the nanometric space that can be accessed by the current technology. In fact, the endofullerenes hold the promise of exciting applications in areas including quantum computations, superconductivity, biomedical fields, drug delivery research, magnetic resonance imaging, and organic photovoltaic devices. Further, the discovery of endofullerenes in extraterrestrial environments indicates their astrophysical relevance. Hence, understanding the influence of the confining fullerene cage on the behavior of the confined species, and vice versa, are matters of great scientific interest. <br/><br/>For atoms confined in a fullerene, recent studies have predicted huge enhancements and alterations in the atom's response to radiation. However, it is not known how the process will evolve if instead a cluster of metal atoms or a smaller fullerene is confined. By examining couplings between such captive-captor pairs, researchers will be able to uncover fundamental effects, thereby substantially adding to the current knowledge. With capabilities of precision measurements being available, such findings shall motivate experiments involving cluster-doped endofullerenes. Furthermore, advancements in technology for generating extremely short attosecond (1 billion billionth of a second) laser pulses enable study of the light-matter interaction time with unprecedented precision. Results from this program produced the best agreement so far with the argon atom's time-delay measurements. Encouraged by this result, attosecond response studies of endofullerenes will be initiated. The outcome may bridge the gap between atto- and nano-sciences to establish a new domain of research in 'atto-nano-science'. Finally, another planned research area will focus on processes wherein a light-driven stimulation is caused at one location inside the compound which subsequently de-stimulates to transfer energy off-site to cause a dramatic response in a new location. The current program will access processes in endofullerenes where such local stimulations may cause a global response. This is similar to an antenna-receiver pair at the molecular scale where the antenna couples to the incoming light and transfers energy globally to enhance the efficiency of the ultimate output by enabling the antenna to also contribute to the process in sync with the receiver. The effect and related knowledge may have significant utilization in nanoscale antenna technology.<br/><br/><br/>This project involves the theoretical study of the response of neutral and ionic endofullerenes to an external photon. Photoelectron cross sections, angular distributions, Wigner-Smith time delays, and intercoulombic decay (ICD) resonances for both pure and hybrid levels of the compound will be calculated. This will help to understand better: (i) The many-body interactions that determine the absorption, temporal and resonant-decay properties at low plasmonic energies; and (ii) The diffraction-type oscillations due to multipath interferences between electron waves from various sites of the compound. Several areas will be studied. First, for atoms confined in C60, recent studies predicted huge enhancements in the atomic photoionization over the C60 plasmon resonance energy region. However, it is not entirely known how this coupling will evolve if instead a metal cluster or a smaller fullerene is confined, since these systems can excite their own plasmons. It is expected that by examining couplings between the plasmon-active captive-captor pair novel effects will be discovered, thereby substantially adding to the current knowledge. With recent capabilities of precision measurements such findings shall motivate experiments involving cluster-doped or onion-type endofullerenes. Second, for a confined atom the photo-liberation of atomic inner-electrons involves reflection off the fullerene shell. For the atom-fullerene hybrid-levels emissions from both the atomic and the fullerene sites occur. The quantum multipath interference between these modes of emissions carries a wealth of information on the geometry of the compound. Replacing the inner atom by a cluster or a fullerene will further compound this interference effect, producing far richer structures in photoionization cross section that can be diagnosed with our recently established Fourier photospectroscopy methods, thereby, significantly advancing scientific knowledge. Next the intercoulombic decay (ICD) process is a naturally abundant nonradiative relaxation pathway of a vacancy in a cluster and a topic of intense contemporary interest. The precursor excitation to form this vacancy can be accomplished by promoting an inner shell electron to an excited state by the photon or charged particle impact. Endofullerenes, being rotational analogues of asymmetric dimers of two concentric and unequal systems, can induce novel ICD processes. Research results in this topic can, therefore, generate significant experimental impetus, besides discovering fundamental effects. Finally, advancements in technology for generating attosecond laser pulses enable study of the light-matter interaction with unprecedented precision by pump-probe experiments. Attosecond photoemission studies of endofullerenes have been initiated. The outcome may bridge the gap between atto- and nano-sciences to establish a new domain of research in 'atto-nano-science'."
0.599998,"One of the most difficult unanswered problems in nuclear and particle physics is how to understand systems in which the components are so tightly bound together that it is impossible to separate them, as occurs inside the proton and neutron and many other particles. This project is designed to explore several methods of obtaining definitive information from such complicated systems, so that one can understandand how they are put together and why they interact the way they do. For most of the approaches to be researched, the investigators initiated the development of the methods used here. This project emphasizes collaborative work with researchers at several other universities and laboratories. The educational component represents an important part of the work to be performed here. The project allows for the training of graduate and undergraduate students both on the analytical aspects of theory, and will also make possible the mentoring of these students for success in their future carreers in industry or academia. <br/><br/>This project includes six specific problems that will be studied, three each for the PI and co-PI in areas of their respective expertise, all related to the question of how to understand systems in which the component particles are so tightly bound that it is difficult or impossible to separate them, such as inside protons and neutrons. These specific problems are 1) how the proton and neutron would be assembled if the strong nuclear force that holds them together had a different number of interaction charges than the three in our universe; 2) how best to extract the maximal amount of information about their detailed internal structure from experiments; 3) how to compute their actual dynamical interactions in a strong-force theory that is a realistic simplified model of the one studied experimentally, and 4) how closely this idealized theory appears to mimic the real one, since much more can be computed exactly from the ideal than from the real theory; 5) how to simulate the structure of an atom, much smaller than conventional atoms, formed from particles (muons) that appear in cosmic rays, which is guaranteed to exist but has not yet been experimentally observed; and 6) using a connection between strongly-interacting theories and gravity in curved spacetimes to study systems in which the strongly-interacting particles have such a high ambient energy that they can be said to have a finite temperature."
0.284233,"The development of novel methods in nuclear many-body theory is critical for the study of phenomena at the frontiers of astrophysics, mesoscopic science, fundamental physics and technology. As a mesoscopic system, the atomic nucleus reveals the transition from the macroscopic world, with pronounced statistical regularities, to the microscopic world, where individual quantum states can be identified and studied. In this project, using the atomic nucleus as a research laboratory, powerful theoretical methods will be developed for the study of generic properties of many-body systems, such as shell structure, superfluidity and superconductivity, particle decay and radiation, the onset of chaotic dynamics and its interplay with collective motion. The project puts a strong emphasis on the development of cross-disciplinary theoretical methods with applicability to various strongly-correlated many-body systems. Applications of these methods provide insights in a variety of nuclear physics phenomena, such as beta decay, charge-exchange reactions, electron capture, two-neutrino and neutrino-less double beta decay, and the weak interaction processes. The work pursued here will support in part the experimental programs concerning the physics of stable and exotic nuclei at radioactive beam facilities.<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed work is to find self-consistent high-precision solutions of the nuclear many-body problem, where masses, matter and charge distributions, spectra, decay and reaction rates can be calculated within the same framework at zero and finite temperatures. The mathematical apparatus for the generalized covariant response theory will be advanced beyond the existing formulation by means of Green's function techniques, involving extra dimensions accounting for nuclear superfluidity effects. The effects of coupling between single-particle and emergent collective degrees of freedom, coupling to the continuum and the formation of bubbles, skins and other exotic geometries will be included on equal footing. The project helps to answer fundamental questions, such as: What is the origin of chemical elements? Where are the limits of nuclear stability? What are the masses of neutrinos? The developed approach will allow for the consistent astrophysical modeling of such competing processes as beta-decay and neutron capture, and thereby remove the ambiguities arising from the nuclear physics input. This project will provide students with an intensive training of their analytical and numerical skills, serving as a basis for their future careers in industry and academia."
0.375,"This research project has the overall goal of increasing our knowledge of nuclear systems both finite (nuclei) and infinite. Particular emphasis is placed on the physics of nuclei with large neutron or proton excess with the intent to provide theoretical support and predictions for experiments at rare isotope facilities, including the new generation at RIKEN Tokyo, GSI Darmstadt, and NSCL/MSU East Lansing. Because most experiments at such facilities employ strongly interacting probes, an improved analysis of such reactions is proposed in order to extract new physics. The serious discrepancies between heavy-ion knockout and transfer reactions make the continued development of this framework urgent. The tool for this research project is the dispersive optical model, based on the Green's function method, which provides a bridge between nuclear reactions and nuclear structure information. Ab initio microscopic calculations of heavier and exotic nuclei are proposed based on the Fadeev random phase approximation (FRPA) formulation of the self-consistent Green's function method. This many-body approach appears to be one of the most promising strategies to deal with medium and heavy nuclei for the calculation of the ground state as well as spectroscopic data. The proposal also outlines concrete steps to clarify the phase diagram of nuclear matter around saturation density, as a function of density, temperature and nucleon asymmetry. <br/><br/>The research aims to raise the standard of the analysis of nuclear reactions and is intended to have a significant impact on the experimental program at facilities like the planned Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). The ab initio FRPA method practiced in the group provides interdisciplinary links with other fields and involves international collaborations with institutions in England, Japan, Spain, and Belgium. The continued exposure of graduate students and young scientists all over the world to the many-body theory book of the PI fosters improved understanding of exciting new phenomena in nuclear physics in other disciplines. The mentoring of graduate assistants and post-doctoral associates in the process and ethic of scientific research is an integral part of the project. Their development toward independence as original and productive scientists is a central objective of the program and will continue to prepare them for industry or academic institutions."

An experiment is being designed to search for a non-zero electric dipole moment of the neutron, whose possible existence is of fundamental interest and would significantly challenge the theoretical extensions of the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. Another experiment under analysis measured second order effects in electron-proton scattering to address a present puzzle on the proton structure data. And there are on-going experiments with cold neutrons measuring the strength of the weak interaction among quarks to be followed by precise new measurements of the parameters governing the neutron decay, which can have an important impact on our understanding of both nuclear physics and astrophysics. <br/><br/>The proposed activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate students, will continue to produce partnerships within the field to develop new detector technologies, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state university as a premier research institution.

0.165,"This project will develop a set of quantum theories for a systematic understanding of fundamental atomic and molecular processes over a wide range of temperatures, from zero kelvin, where everything behaves quantum mechanically, to room temperature, where certain aspects of the atomic and molecular motion have evolved into classical behavior, but with subtle quantum effects remain that can play a crucial role in astronomy, chemistry, condensed matter, and biology. While quantum theories can be relatively simple near absolute zero temperature, it can become exceedingly difficult at higher temperatures where the number of states has grown dramatically. Can we efficiently deal with quantum systems with many states? Can quantum theories for atoms and molecules be not only accurate, but also sufficiently simple and systematic that they can be used to build new quantum theories for more complex few-body and many-body systems? These are the fundamental questions that we expect to make progress on, based upon a set of conceptual and mathematical advances that the PI, his students, and colleagues have accumulated in over a decade. <br/><br/>In terms of broader impact, atomic and molecular interactions and processes are at the very foundation of physical sciences. There is a wide range of applications in areas ranging from cold atoms to astrophysics. This work will allow substantially new, accurate yet simple quantum theories for atomic and molecular processes to be developed. This project will involve the training of graduate students. These students will be well trained in fundamental quantum physics of atoms and molecules. This will allow them to develop new theories and models in other areas of physical sciences such as astronomy, chemistry, condensed matter, and biology."
0.47,"This is a collaborative research program between Vladimir Braginsky's Moscow State University (MSU) group and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Laboratory. It focuses on two types of enhancements under consideration for Advanced LIGO: the use of crystalline silicon for the interferometer mirrors to reduce thermal noise, and quantum measurement techniques that can give sensitivities beyond the current limits due to quantum (shot) noise. Crystalline silicon is known to have excellent mechanical properties and has a minimum in its thermal expansion near 120 K. Operation at this point would minimize thermal noise. However, many aspects are not yet well enough understood for large scale application. Under this grant, we explore techniques for fabricating silicon ribbons for a silicon test mass suspension operating at 120 K, measure dissipation in silicon ribbon suspensions, and to find ways of minimization dissipation and thermal noise in the silicon suspensions. We investigate optical losses and other poorly measured thermal, mechanical and optical properties of pure high-ohmic crystalline silicon and other possible candidate materials for test masses from room to liquid nitrogen temperatures. Finally we analyze sources of noise in crystalline coatings applied to silicon test masses. The other main limitation to the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO will be quantum (shot) noise. We also continue the investigation of new topologies and measurement schemes for laser gravitational wave detectors, relevant to both Enhanced Advanced LIGO and beyond, and allowing us to suppress quantum noise and to relax requirements for the circulating optical power. <br/><br/>The results of this work have a number of impacts. The most direct is that the techniques developed can be used to make gravitational wave detectors more sensitive, and thus help derive more information about the astrophysical phenomena that cause gravitational waves. Understanding the unusual conditions that create gravitational waves improves our understanding of violent processes that shape our universe exciting and inspiring students and the public. More broadly, the same techniques which are developed under this research can be used in a number of precision measurement applications in science and engineering. These include reducing noise in precison frequency reference standards to produce more accurate clocks, making quantum cryptography and quantum computing more feasible, improved tests of fundamental assumptions about space and matter, and ... finally, a major goal of this work is to foster closer collaboration on peaceful research between Russian and US scientists. This promotes better understanding between the scientific communities in these two super-powers."
0.688211,"Experiments at rare isotope beam facilities open the door to new regions of exotic nuclei. Data gathered at these facilities is essential for accurate extrapolations of the equation of state of nucleonic matter in density, temperature, and proton fraction and is expected to impact the direct comparison of astrophysical observations with results of sophisticated simulations of neutron stars and supernovae. The projects funded by this award address fundamental theoretical aspects of nuclear physics using effective field theory and renormalization group methods to develop a systematic expansion of nuclear forces and decouple troublesome high-energy contributions from the low-energy parts we want to describe. The results are controlled, model-independent calculations that can exploit efficiently the steady improvements in computing power. <br/><br/>The training received by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates in carrying out the proposed activities contributes directly to the building of a diverse scientific workforce. The mix of analytical and numerical computation employed is excellent preparation for both academic and industrial research. The emphasis on universal aspects of physical systems, fostered by effective field theory and renormalization group approaches, as well as the direct application of techniques to problems beyond the nuclear domain, leads to enhanced collaborations between disciplines. Broader training in low-energy nuclear theory for both theorists and experimentalists is provided by participation in the TALENT (Training in Advanced Low Energy Nuclear Theory) initiative."

0.390838,"Major transitions in the history of life occurred when individual biological entities came together to form interdependent groups with emergent properties that differed from the individuals. The most recent of these transitions occurred when solitary organisms joined together to form cooperative societies. This transition to sociality has been particularly remarkable because many distinct individuals are able to behave as a single organism through the coordinated actions of society members. The best examples of such ""superorganisms"" are colonies of social insects. Social insect super-organisms breathe, feed, grow, breed and modify their environments. Although each life system is important on its own, the balance at the colony level arises from coordinated action of all systems. The purpose of this research program is to discover physical principles that play important roles in super-organism physiology. Super-organism regulatory principles will be of use in systems where information and physical networks coexist, such as in pedestrian and vehicle traffic, urban and disaster landscapes, and neural and artificial networks. The proposed studies could also help explain why the biological transition to sociality has been so successful.<br/><br/>The proposed studies will probe physical aspects of super-organism physiology from a ""top-down"" approach to discover emergent behavioral, biomechanical, and social features. This will be complemented by a ""bottom-up"" approach that will discover how aspects of super-organism physiology (exoskeleton, organization of circulatory system, healing mechanisms) depend on soil properties, ant morphology, grain manipulation biomechanics, and genetics. This research will be conducted using the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, as a model super-organism system. Fire ants possess highly developed social systems and work together to complete complex tasks. The goal of this research is to elucidate principles governing the functioning of the super-organism and the processes responsible for super-organism stability and success. Specifically, this program will study super-organism features that are analogous to those in single organisms including: (1) Super-organism exoskeleton construction: this research will investigate processes by which the super-organism constructs a robust exoskeleton, its nest, from cohesive granular media. Such processes will include biomechanics of excavation in different media, social interactions upon nest formation (like communication, recruitment, workload distribution) and intelligent construction methods (e.g. can ants probe grain level stresses). (2) Super-organism circulation: This research will deduce traffic optimization strategies in confined spaces. Such strategies may include separation of work tasks in space and time, localization of movement in nest space, organization of information hubs, and modification of the carrier's behavior in response to heavy traffic. (3) Super-organism nervous system: This research will discover how information is transmitted through a patterned environment through tactile interactions of individuals. The approaches used will lead to an understanding of how the superorganism nervous and circulatory systems co-exist. (4) Super-organism homeostasis of physical properties of the nest: This research will determine the response of the super-organism to perturbations arising from flooding, mechanical insults to nest networks, invasion of competitive species, and genetic variation derived from hybridization of fire ant species. The research team will leverage the representation of female group members to attract female students to study of the interface between biology and physics, which should attract students who might be discouraged by the barriers in more established fields. The research team will also explore strategies of public involvement through hands-on and DIY initiatives, collaboration with public education clubs and integration of science with the entertainment industry."

0.21,"Gordon Moore, the founder of Intel, was the first to note that the number of transistors per chip roughly doubled every two years (this is called Moore's Law). The corresponding volume per transistor had to decrease exponentially with time. Miniaturization would eventually lead to such a small number of electrons per transistor that the discriminable charging effect of the electrons in a transistor fails. The point where miniaturization destroys the transistor function is known as Moore's limit. This limit is imminent within the next generation of scientists and engineers. New avenues of progress beyond current technology must be sought. This research follows the approach of quantum technology to continue the evolution of information processing beyond Moore's limit. It works to develop the necessary foundational knowledge for an approach to devices, where the behavior of these devices is governed not by the usual rules that govern the aggregate properties of a large number of particles, but by the laws of quantum mechanics, which governs electrons in the atomic limit. Specifically, this project focuses on the study of optically controlled semiconductor quantum dots. A dot effectively traps one electron, which is manipulated by ultrafast pulses of light that enable terahertz control speeds without the complexities of metal contacts. The studies emphasize the isolation of the electron from the influence of the other electrons (known as the valence electrons) and the nuclei, in particular, which constitute the dot, and the networking of the target electrons in separate dots. Light is used to excite the valence electrons to control a single target electron and to entangle two target electrons, while shielding them from the effects of nuclear fluctuations. The primary intellectual merit is based on the scientific objectives of this three-year research program; produce quantum entangled states between two electron spins separated by a large distance, demonstrate a multi-quantum-bit high-speed logic gate, and explore the feasibility of using optical control of nuclear states to store and or process information. The broader impact includes developing the basic knowledge to advance the technology of information processing beyond Moore's limit via a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative research program, training and preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers for new challenges they will be facing, and facilitating efforts by both our universities to inform and educate the public and students about the importance of this quantum research to society's well-being, including how this research is training students in STEM areas in order to maintain a competitive work force. <br/><br/>This research focuses on quantum information processing by ultrafast optical control of electron spins trapped individually in structurally defined semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Numerous advances made possible by previous NSF support, have helped meet many of the milestones of quantum operations required by the Di Vincenzo criteria. Recent advances such as demonstration of the flying qubit and nuclear spin fluctuation freezing to extend the electron-spin coherence time and creation of high optical quality laterally positioned dots are fundamental to the quantum network approach to scaling up the system. The critical discovery of nuclear spin fluctuation freezing enables lengthening the coherence time of the qubit by over 2-3 orders of magnitude for time scales lasting longer than 1 second. This allows the time for a complete sequence of computational steps with the ultrafast control including error correction. The method consists in freezing out the fluctuations of the nuclear spins unavoidably present in QDs and temporally separates the decoherence abatement from the control operations, in contrast to the common but more limited and complex method of dynamic decoupling of the qubits being processed at the same time. Building on these achievements five experimental objectives to advance the frontier of scalable quantum information processing based on optical control of the spins will be accomplished: demonstrate a two-bit controlled not-gate and of a simple algorithm using a quantum dot molecule; demonstrate teleportation of information in a single photon qubit to a QD using spontaneous parametric (singe-photon) down conversion (SPDC) to produce the single photon source; produce an entangled state between a quantum dot spin and a spontaneously emitted photon (at 960nm) and convert it to the telecom wavelength around 1.55 microns; demonstrate heralded entanglement of two QD spins using photons.; and extend the work on nuclear spin fluctuation freezing to using optically detected NMR to more completely understand the underlying physics state of nuclei in the dot. <br/><br/>The work is an interdisciplinary research effort in the physics of semiconductor nano-structures, high-precision coherent optical control, and spectroscopy of QDs. These studies are paralleled by the coherent transient time domain studies consistent with device applications and scalable architectures. The amelioration of the environmental problem (decoherence) lies in the coordinated theoretical and experimental treatment of the quantum correlated dynamics of the optically controlled electron spin and the nuclear spins in the QD through the hyperfine interaction without additional stochastic assumptions.The intellectual merit arises from the increasingly sophisticated understanding of the interaction effects between a microscopic system (the electron spins as the qubits) and a macroscopic system (the dot environment, control or measurement) within quantum theory. The broad bandwidth control of the quantum physics makes the QD system the high speed processing unit partner to the quantum memory device of trapped ions. The operating temperature of 4-10 K is above the milli-K required by gated dots and superconducting circuits and optical control avoids some of the connection problems.<br/><br/>The broader impact is first in the development of highly trained people critical to the infrastructure of quantum technology, at all levels of higher education: postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students. The second broader impact is that the optical approach positions our research to play a key role in the transition from the electronic devices that currently drive the Moore?s law to the new paradigm of post CMOS era. The further miniaturization of the current devices that process classical information will reach the quantum barrier where devices operating on quantum information will take over. The future lies in a hybrid structure of classical devices for interface with human and quantum devices for information processing. The optical approach to quantum devices, based on the established III-V material with a large industrial infrastructure and optical sources and gating based on telecom technology, may provide a smooth transition to the hybrid structure."
0.18,"A quantum spin, like a classical magnet, can point at any direction, but a collection of quantum spins generally behave in a more exotic way and can point to many more directions than classical spins do. This usually translates to the feature that quantum many-body problems are much harder than classical problems. However, in some physical models, quantum spins, even though they can point to more directions (which originate from large spin magnitudes), turn out to behave much like classical magnets, with only small fluctuations around the direction they point to. It seems that even in the quantum world, there are regions that look more or less like the classical world. Where is the boundary between the classical and quantum territories? When do quantum problems become easy and when do they become hard? These two intimately related questions are the subject of this project. A clear characterization of such a `transition' will help to understand the exotic properties of quantum many-body systems.<br/><br/>The integration of the research findings of this project into education on quantum information and quantum many-body physics will help to nurture a new generation of students with new tools of thinking. This project also includes training of a graduate student and mentoring of a postdoctoral researcher. The planned outreach activities such as giving public lectures, mentoring high school students for summer research projects, and developing materials and activities for high school students in science and mathematics education will complement the research activities and lead to sustaining impacts."
0.12,"Einstein's famous relation E=mc^2 expresses the equivalence of mass and energy and is one of the most well-known formulae in physics. It is a consequence of the theory of special relativity. A direct test of E=mc^2 can be performed by comparing the mass difference between two nuclear states to the energy that is released when a transition between those two states occurs. In this research we will measure the mass difference between two isotopes of chlorine, 35Cl and 36Cl, and compare it to the result of precise gamma ray spectroscopy measurements of the energy released after 35Cl captures a neutron. The atomic masses of 35Cl and 36Cl will be determined using Penning trap mass spectrometry, in which the mass of an ion is measured via the frequency of its motions in a combined magnetic and electric field. At Central Michigan University (CMU) a novel double Penning trap will be constructed and housed inside a 12 tesla superconducting magnet. This apparatus will be used to perform measurements on pairs of ions stored in two identical traps, which will enable the effect of magnetic field variations to be reduced. A comparison of the 35Cl and 36Cl mass difference with the gamma-ray spectroscopy energy measurement will also enable a calibration of gamma-ray energy standards used by detectors in nuclear physics applications in terms of atomic masses. In addition, it can be used to provide a precise determination of two important fundamental constants of nature: the Molar Planck constant and the fine structure constant, and could impact experimental data required for a possible redefinition of the kilogram.<br/><br/>The research program under development at CMU will provide training of Masters and undergraduate students who will gain research experience in modern experimental atomic and nuclear physics techniques, creating an avenue for them to go on to pursue a Ph.D. or enter positions in the technical workforce. The CMU Penning trap will use ions produced by an external ion source and injected into the trap. This will enable many additional precision mass measurements to be performed on a wide range of isotopes, such as those with very low natural abundances, and long-lived radioactive isotopes and isomers, with applications in atomic, nuclear and neutrino physics. The techniques being developed could impact other high sensitivity mass spectrometry applications such as the single-ion Penning trap for rare-isotopes under development at nearby Michigan State University, and mass spectrometers used in national security applications for trace chemical detection."
0.5,"This CAREER Award supports a project aiming to describe, simulate, and predict new properties and emergent phenomena in physical systems of interacting particles of light. These particles, called photons, are abundant: visible light, radio waves, and x-rays all consist of photons. In free space, an individual photon remains essentially unaffected by the presence of additional photons. This lack of interaction renders photons the perhaps simplest fundamental particles known today. Strong interactions between photons can, however, be induced in artificial systems which confine photons to resonators and force them to interact with an additional component (e.g., an atom or a circuit made of superconducting material). The consequences of the induced interaction between photons are surprising: light can exhibit behavior usually associated with massive particles. Through this award, theoretical models for describing this new type of quantum behavior will be developed and analyzed in the context of upcoming experimental data. The primary goal of research funded by the award is to address the challenge of developing needed tools for the quantitative understanding and prediction of strongly interacting photon states and their properties.<br/><br/>The research program will be embedded in an education plan that integrates current research, expertise in special topics of condensed matter theory, and modern teaching methods into the curriculum, and encourages undergraduate and graduate students to engage in research and outreach activities. Outreach efforts will actively contribute to several programs established in Northwestern's Office for Science Outreach and Public Engagement, and are designed to promote science literacy, raise public science engagement, and break down widely held stereotypes of science researchers."
0.339996,"The Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle physics gives an excellent description of the strong and electroweak interactions, the forces that influence the structure and behavior of elementary particles such as the proton and neutron. The SM also describes most of what we know about the visible matter in the Universe. The Higgs Boson, discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland, was the last ingredient in this theory. Yet the overwhelming success of the SM seems only to emphasize its limitations. There are many open questions remaining. Why are there three families of quarks, elementary particles that make up the proton and neutron, and leptons, elementary particles such as the electron and muon? What is the nature of space-time itself? Do the extra dimensions suggested by string theories and string- inspired models really exist? Where do dark energy and dark matter fit into our current picture of the universe? Answers to these key questions can only be found by including new physics beyond the SM. This group will work with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC to look for this new physics by searching for new particles emerging from proton-proton collisions. An exciting feature of this program is that a number of undergraduate and Masters students from Fresno and other Cal State institutions will be involved. They will participate not only in this analysis thrust but will also gain hands-on experience helping in a variety of hardware projects from other ATLAS collaborators.<br/><br/>In this proposed research plan, Professor Gao and his group at California State University, Fresno will continue to search for particles from new physics in di-jet events. The use of di-jet data as a way to search for new physics is a classic approach with a long history, and requires precise understanding of the jet energy scales expected from the SM. The PI has considerable experience in jet physics and is well aware of the challenges this presents. He intends to build on successful prior work in which new variables were identified that should discriminate a potential new physics signal from QCD. Such variables, by construction, use the radiation patterns from partons in a multi-variate analysis of the structures observed."
0.18816,"Overview<br/>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM). One of the promising techniques to look for BSM physics is to make precision measurements using standard particles like electrons and muons. One technique, in particular, is to make very precise measurements of the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of electrons or muons. To do the next generation of EDM measurements will require advances in accelerator techniques and this award will focus on those advancements.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>Direct EDM searches using all-electric storage rings, with measurements of stored electrons, protons, or radioactive nuclei are being considered. Historically only a very small number of all-electric rings have been constructed and none at the scale envisioned for these dedicated EDM measurements. Thus, the research enabled here will provide essential insights into the feasibility of using larger-scale high-gradient electric field devices for these important measurements. The success of the EDM experimental procedure is strongly connected to the ability to create a suitably robust storage ring that can perform the desired functions necessary for successful spin precession measurements of intense beams at the accuracies required. Through this award, studies will be performed in pursuit of storage ring arrangements and parameter sets suitable for use in EDM measurements. For verification of results, comparisons will be made, where applicable, to beam conditions being created for a present-day EDM measurement of the muon system. This award will provide students of accelerator science the opportunity to engage with expert members of the field to acquire first-hand experience in the design and specification process for relevant storage ring systems for future EDM experiments, yielding a more experienced workforce upon exit from the university program.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Accelerator science will lead the way to future accelerators for virtually every branch of science and for a broad spectrum of applications to meet national needs, and collaboration between national laboratories and research universities is a natural approach to attract, train and educate a new generation of accelerator scientists and engineers. The learning curve for scientists to cross into the applied field of accelerator science is often long, and hence acquiring practical skill and knowledge as graduate students will provide a highly desired early-experience for future members of the much-needed workforce. The training and experiences enabled through this award will ultimately reach into many areas of research as the workforce expands into other technical disciplines."
0.664192,"Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities have been used in a variety of particle accelerators for quite some time. The ulra-low electrical resistivity of a superconductor material allows a radio frequency resonator (needed for an accelerator) to obtain a high quality factor (Q) which allows energy storage with very low loss. Future accelerators, important in many areas of science and medicine, will benefit from advances such as the techniques in this award. This award is for advanced studies of superconductors used in SRF accelerators. Superconductors used in SRF are limited by the fundamental surface resistance. The next significant breakthrough in the SRF cavity technology is only possible if the physics of surface resistance is fully understood. The main goal of this research is to provide an understanding of the origin of the various contributions to the power dissipation in superconducting niobium and in particular the origin of the non-linear behavior as a function of the radio frequency field. This award includes integrated experimental and theoretical parts to address the unresolved issues of the surface resistance of superconductors at high radio frequency field, and in particular how the surface composition and structure can be modified and tuned in order to reduce surface resistance. The theoretical work will guide the experimental work which, in turn, will provide feedback to further develop the theory. This research will be performed by two graduate students and thus contribute to the education of accelerator scientists, who are in extremely short supply. The successful completion of this work will be very beneficial for the ongoing R&D of high performance SRF cavities. Addressing the outstanding problems of the residual surface resistance and the increase of the quality factor Q with the radio frequency field magnitude can help guide the ongoing R&D of SRF cavities and evaluate possibilities of promising new materials as possible SRF materials. This work will have a significant impact on the application of the SRF technology in general, and to accelerators operating in continuous wave mode in particular.<br/><br/>In this award some of the unresolved issues in our understanding of the surface resistance of superconductors will be addressed, in particular: (1) the physics of the residual resistance, which can exceed 20% of the theoretical contribution; (2) mechanisms of the observed increase of Q with the field and the possibilities of using this effect to extend the increase of Q to higher fields to boost the cavity performance; (3) possibilities of increasing the Q factor by managing impurities; and (4) making SRF materials other than Niobium useful for low field accelerator applications at low temperature."

0.24,"This award provides support for a group with one PI, a senior colleague, a technician and two undergraduate students to work on a new kind of particle detector using a technology similar to that used in flat screen ""plasma"" television displays. These displays use small hermetically sealed cells containing a gas that can hold electric charge. In this application, the charge will be stimulated by the passage of charged particles passing through the gas cells and can be sensed electronically. The identity of which cells have been charged provides the spatial information on the particles. Preliminary tests suggest that it will be possible for these devices to detect particles in a billionth of a second and that cells can be made with a size of about one tenth of a millimeter. Using experience from commercial providers of flat screen televisions, it is hoped that these detectors can be larger and cheaper than the types in use in other particle physics instruments today. These detectors may find application in the medical or other communities interested in charged particle tracking. These and other particle physics applications will also be discussed in public dissemination. Basic skills in electronics and fabrication techniques will be passed along to undergraduates from U. Michigan State who have the opportunity to work on this project. The proposed R&D plan will allow the development, in three phases, of a prototype device performing at the design resolution of less than 100 micron (spatial) and 1 nanosecond (in time). This award covers the first part of this effort, the completion of the first two phases, providing a resolution of about a factor two (spatially) larger than this."

The three faculty members and their students focus on research designed to explore the structure of nucleons (neutrons and protons) which are the basic building blocks of any atomic nucleus. While it is understood that nucleons are composed of three interacting (via gluon exchange) quarks (viewed as fundamental particles) the picture of the mechanisms that give rise and govern the evolution of multi-quark systems (protons, neutrons, nuclei) is not yet complete. <br/><br/>The group participates in studies aimed at clarifying this picture by charting the structure of nuclei and nucleons using electron, muon, and photon probes.

0.526442,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
0.3,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Neal Weiner at New York University.<br/><br/>The Standard Model is known to be an incomplete theory of nature. Most of the matter of the universe (the ""dark matter"", solidly established by astronomical and cosmological observations) consists of something undiscovered, and thus there must exist new particles not in the Standard Model. Additionally, the presence of the Higgs boson and the expected properties of a quantum field theory together suggest that new particles and fields will be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, because the properties of both of these new sets of particles are unknown, a broad theoretical study is required in order to evaluate what possible new particles might be discoverable with present techniques and what new search strategies might be needed. As part of this project, Professor Weiner intends to investigate a broad range of theoretical scenarios, both top-down (motivated by new and existing theoretical scenarios) and bottom-up (motivated by new signatures) as well as their experimental implications for the LHC and for direct-detection experiments. Additionally, Professor Weiner will pursue studies to understand the sensitivities of dark-matter searches, with a focus on the sensitivities of the astrophysical assumptions present in the existing analyses.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will be wide ranging. Professor Weiner will involve both students and postdocs in his research program, providing opportunities to train future scientists. He will also continue his participation in physics summer schools (as invited), such as the TASI, CLASHEP, ICTP and Les Houches programs, to educate current PhD students on active research topics. Finally, he will continue his efforts to engage the public through public lectures as well as his outreach at the high-school level, anchored by his continued participation with the Governor's School summer program in North Carolina."
0.08079,"The understanding of the strong interactions, the force that determines the structure of atomic nuclei, is one of the most challenging problems in the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the number and properties of all the elementary particles. The fundamental theory of the strong interactions, based on the theory of quarks and gluons known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), has a very complex dynamics which gives rise to the rich properties of hadrons (baryons, including protons and neutrons, and mesons and their excitations) and also to the complexity observed in nuclear interactions and structure. The challenges are therefore many and very complex. Those challenges require a variety of experimental efforts, as well as theoretical efforts. In this context, this project will further develop the connection between the fundamental theory of QCD and hadronic/nuclear physics. It is expected that tools and methods developed in that context may have a broader domain of applications. The PI is a joint appointee in the Theory Group at Jefferson Lab, providing him with the opportunity to focus on Jefferson Lab related physics. An important mission of the project is the education and training at Hampton University of graduate and undergraduate students. An additional broader impact of the project will be the PI's interaction with scientists involved in Jefferson Lab experiments.<br/><br/>This project focuses on low and intermediate energy strong interactions in single hadron and few nucleon problems, as well as some fundamental aspects of QCD. The methods used are based in rigorous descriptions of the strong interactions known as effective theories, which are consistent with QCD, and make use of experimental as well as lattice QCD calculations results. The aim is to advance the theoretical knowledge of QCD and the develop theoretical methods. More specifically, in single hadrons, two main lines of research will be pursued: 1) Development and applications of an improved chiral effective theory in baryons, where the combination of the low energy and the 1/Nc expansions (Nc is the number of color degrees of freedom in QCD) is implemented; applications to baryon observables, and in particular to results obtained in Lattice QCD for those observables will be pursued, where in particular the quark mass dependencies accessible through Lattice QCD will be utilized for analyzing issues of convergence of the effective theory. Particular emphasis will be on the applications to baryons involving strangeness, where there are still unresolved issues with the implementation of effective theories due to the relatively large mass of the strange quark. In particular, these studies have impact in for improving the accuracy of the extraction of weak interaction parameters from hyperon decays. 2) Study of excited baryons in the framework of the 1/Nc expansion, which has as main aim the use of that fundamental expansion of QCD to organize the description of baryon resonances; this work has an impact in the analysis of current experimental results on baryon resonances from various facilities, in particular Jefferson Lab, and it can also be applied to the current Lattice QCD calculations of the excited baryon spectrum. In few body physics, the research is focused on applying the combined chiral effective theory and 1/Nc expansion to study the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Among the fundamental aspects of QCD, the project will focus on pure glue-dynamics, studying its fundamental non-perturbative quantities, namely gluon condensate and topological susceptibility using methods of holographic QCD."
4.655,"This award funds a broad program of measurements in nuclear physics by faculty and students at Florida State University (FSU). The experiments include studies of nuclear reactions and decays that play key roles in all stages of stellar processes. This aspect of the program supports the large investment made and being made in astronomical observations worldwide. Other experiments focus on the evolution of nuclear shell structure with increasing neutron number, especially near the magic numbers of 20 and 28. The behavior of nuclei at ultra-high spin will be explored through discrete gamma spectroscopy using arrays of gamma detectors at FSU and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The group will also exploit heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to investigate the characteristics of the quark-gluon plasma. The broader societal impacts of this project lie in the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in a hands-on environment. Florida State University has served as one of the leading educators in the field of nuclear physics (4th highest Ph.D. production in the U.S.) and this grant will enable the group to continue to attract and train the best and brightest graduate students in experimental nuclear physics. Because of the students' training and hands-on work with high tech equipment in a forefront nuclear physics laboratory, FSU graduates are in high demand and now serve in key roles in homeland security, national defense, high-tech industry, leading edge research, and STEM education. Finally, these measurements will be important for understanding stellar processes and the abundance of elements in our universe. <br/><br/>A significant part of the proposed research uses short-lived rare nuclear isotopes from the FSU Fox Laboratory to study nuclear reactions and structure in unstable nuclei. This is very important for reactions of astrophysical importance, many of which proceed through unstable nuclei. These beams have low intensity and so will benefit from the ANASEN active target and detector array recently developed by FSU in collaboration with Louisiana State University. A newly developed neutron detector array (RESONEUT) will be used to study (d,n) reactions in inverse kinematics with radioactive beams. A series of experiments is planned to measure the critical parameter of lifetime following beta decay of heavy, neutron-rich nuclei on and close to the expected r-process path at TRIUMF. The confrontation of state-of-the-art shell model calculations for multiple cross-shell excitations with proposed nuclear structure measurements will strengthen their reliability for extrapolation to the astrophysically important region. The FSU 14C beam will be used to explore nuclear structure in more neutron-rich nuclei with a recently digitized Germanium detector array. Measurements using gamma detector arrays (GRETINA and GAMMASPHERE) will explore newly proposed exotic shapes and ultra-high-spin structures in the atomic mass ~ 150 region. Other work involves studying the quark-gluon plasma with heavy flavor probes using the PHENIX detector system, parts of which were constructed at FSU. In this instance the FSU focus is on the effects of cold nuclear matter on heavy quarkonia production."
0.222,"Non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas are a new and fascinating type of a plasma that has tremendous potential in medicine and nanotechnology. Our understanding of the atmospheric microplasmas and the nature of the plasma interaction with biological matter is very limited. In this project, we will, in particular, advance the knowledge of atmospheric microplasmas relevant for medical applications. This research program will serve as a vehicle for undergraduate and graduate education in the field of plasma science. The PIs will make a concerted effort to involve women and under-represented minority students in this project by working closely with the relevant student organizations at George Washington University. To recruit women, the Society of Women Engineers will be contacted and informed of the project activities. In addition, undergraduate students will be engaged in the research through the Work Study program or a Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement. The experience will impart them with the knowledge and the skills to excel in independent academic or industry careers they pursue after completing their education. The educational plan for this project also aims to generate interest in science and technology in the area of plasma science and bioengineering and to reach out to K-12 teachers, school children and their parents. In particular, we plan to interact with local schools in the Metropolitan DC area.<br/><br/>The central objective of this project is to understand the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas with a view towards biological applications. To this end we will develop and implement a wide range of new diagnostic methodologies and tools applicable for atmospheric microplasmas. The overall project will address the ionization mechanism, energy balance and conditions for streamer propagation as well as effects related to overvoltage. This project has both fundamental and technological significance. The fundamental significance of this project is in understanding the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas. To this end a wide spectrum of diagnostic instrumentation for atmospheric pressure microplasmas will be developed. Availability of this instrumentation has critical importance for the future progress of the field of atmospheric microplasmas. Enabled by these advances, the technological significance lies in exploring the wide range of applications of atmospheric microplasmas, such as plasma medicine and nanotechnology."
0.36,"We study the dynamics of canonical quantum gravity in a variety of 1+1 dimensional model systems including spherically symmetric gravity coupled to fields in four dimensions and the Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger black holes. Among the techniques used are recently developed local gauge fixings, loop quantum gravity treatments, and a new paradigm for dealing with the dynamics of totally constrained theories that we have been developing over the last few years. The paradigm consists in constructing discrete theories such that the continuum theory of interest arises as a well defined limit. It has points in common with that of lattice gauge theory, where discrete theories are used in a limiting procedure to define a continuum theory of interest. This approach has already been applied successfully in some situations where the space-time has some spatial dependence (i.e. more complicated than homogeneous cosmologies) but without genuine degrees of freedom, most notably providing a characterization of the complete space-time of a non-singular loop quantum gravity black hole. We propose here to extend it to richer models with dependence on one spatial coordinate. The models include complex phenomena like the one discussed by Choptuik in gravitational collapse and at the quantum level can accommodate Hawking radiation. We also continue our investigation on the role of using physical clocks and rods in describing quantum mechanics, to apply high performance computing techniques to loop quantum cosmology and to explore astrophysical implications of loop quantum gravity effects in the evaporation of primordial black holes.<br/><br/>This research fits within fundamental physics, the area of research that concerns itself with how the laws of physics fit together. In this case the laws of gravity that rule the large scales of the universe with the laws of quantum mechanics that describe the microscopic world. Sometimes by understanding how the laws of physics fit together remarkable insights can be achieved that lead to practical applications far beyond what anyone could have envisioned. Apart from the intrinsic research aspects, broader impacts of this proposal are aiding in the creation of human resources in US physics through the training of a postdoctoral researcher and the possibility that the techniques introduced here may have applicability in other areas of science and engineering as well. In addition to that, various outreach activities for the general public are planned that will help not only disseminate the results of this proposal but those of the community of physicists working on the subfield of loop quantum gravity as a whole."
0.074591,"This project will pursue the development of unitary qubit lattice algorithms (QULA) to solve problems in nonlinear physics by extending ideas used in lattice Boltzmann and lattice gas algorithms. QULA for scalar 2D and 3D Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) have already provided new information on the unexpected behavior of continuum Hamiltonians. The major thrust of this project will be to examine energy spectral cascades in spinor-BEC quantum turbulence where the flow involves both Abelian and non-Abelian vortices. Such spinor quantum turbulence has yet to be simulated in any real detail, particularly in 3D, and the novel algorithms developed here can be viewed as a mesoscopic model for nonlinear physics. This research is also expected to have a profound impact on plasma and space physics applications, as QULA will allow for the study of magneto-hydrodynamics turbulence and magnetic reconnection. The QULA algorithms are manifestly unitary and can be readily encoded onto future quantum computers.<br/><br/>The broad impacts of this project include the training of the workforce of the future, with graduate and undergraduate students having the opportunity to learn and work in an important field of scientific inquiry. Students will acquire hands-on experience on the use of high-performance computational platforms, as QULA scale ideally on modern supercomputers and the scaling was tested up to several hundreds of thousands of cores."
0.596335,"This award will allow for the establishment of a strong research and educational development program in the field of ultrafast atomic, molecular, and optical sciences in the Department of Physics at the University of Arizona. The program will study atomic and molecular response to strong transient electric fields with simultaneous use of IR and XUV pulses in attosecond precision experiments. This will involve measurement and control of electronic and nuclear dynamics in highly-excited molecules using attosecond/femtosecond resolved pump-probe experiments. Ultrashort XUV excitation provides direct access to an interesting and challenging regime, where atoms and molecules are energetically far from their ground-state configuration. Using attosecond time-resolved XUV+IR experiments, we can measure the effect of strong electric fields on excited bound-state wavepackets in atomic systems. These measurements will offer new opportunities for the control of electron dynamics on attosecond time-scales. In molecules, the XUV excitation is associated with fast inner-valence electron phenomenon, correlated two-electron processes, and strongly interdependent electronic and nuclear dynamics. The understanding of time-resolved dynamics in this regime has been very limited due to the spectroscopic difficulties in probing inherently low cross-section photo-fragmentation channels; the complexity of the potential energy surface manifold in highly-excited systems; and the paucity of efficient, tunable, femtosecond/attosecond XUV photon sources. This project aims at investigating this regime by utilizing cutting-edge research tools, such as, tailored XUV pulses, and efficient photo-fragment imaging schemes.<br/><br/>The broader aspects include the CAREER educational objectives that will increase the representation of Hispanic students in physics research; directly involve undergraduate students in ultrafast science research; and lead to the development and web-based dissemination of interactive learning programs. This training and outreach, along with the forefront research will help make our nation more competitive in the field of attosecond and femtosecond science. The educational plan targets students from an under-represented group. In collaboration with a primarily Hispanic institution (UTEP), Hispanic students will obtain hands-on experience and vital exposure in a cutting edge field of research. With the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, the educational program leads to the development of interactive learning programs in optics/AMO, along with a method for web-based publication and dissemination, in a manner that will be useful to wider community. The research spin-offs of this program will be in the form of new insights and discoveries, which will impact other related fields such as quantum optics, theoretical atomic and molecular physics, coherent control, atmospheric chemistry, chemical imaging and radiation chemistry."
0.455,"This work will advance our understanding of how electrons move in molecules. The motion of electrons in atoms, molecules and solids takes place on attosecond (a billionth of a billionth of a second) timescales, and requires very short laser pulses to resolve. The investigators in this project will use intense ultrashort laser pulses in order to ionize molecules, removing one of the many electrons bound to the molecule. They will take pictures of the electrons as they come off the molecules, making use of a technique called velocity map imaging. These pictures can be used to understand electron dynamics during ionization, which is important for molecular imaging, chemical dynamics and the development of new high speed electronics. <br/><br/>This project will make use of shaped few cycle laser pulses to study strong field ionization of small molecules. The investigators will make use of ultrafast optical pulse shaping of filament based sub 10 fs (3-4 optical cycles) laser pulses, as well as velocity map imaging in order to study the angle and momentum resolved photoelectron spectrum as a function of laser pulse shape. This will help develop our understanding of how electrons are removed from multiple orbitals, and the extent to which electron correlation and non-Born Oppenheimer dynamics play a role in the ionization dynamics. The investigators will also make use of strong field ionization as a probe of excited state dynamics, studying dissociation and internal conversion in families of similar molecules."
0.3,"Particle physics experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN seek to explore fundamental questions in modern physics, such as how particles attain mass, why gravity is weak, and the nature of dark matter. The large quantity of data produced at experimental facilities such as the LHC requires the development of complex pattern recognition algorithms and software techniques to achieve the scientific goals of these physics programs. This project will investigate new algorithms and techniques for data analysis using emerging computing processor architectures. These activities will enable the LHC experiments to take data more efficiently and improve the quality of the data that is recorded in order to extend the reach of the next generation of discoveries from planned hardware upgrades at the LHC over the next decade. The results of this research will significantly reduce the cost of computing for all LHC experiments. Software source code tools will be made available to the particle physics community. The investigators will host workshops to train post-doctoral fellows and graduate students from all areas of particle physics on how to use these advanced techniques. This training is valuable preparation for dealing with big data science in general.<br/><br/>This project will support research focused on novel compute architectures for parallelized and vectorized charged particle track reconstruction. This research will improve the reach of energy-frontier particle physics experiments, such as the ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE experiments at the LHC and any other fields where studying the passage of charged particles is of critical importance. The science targeted in this project includes studying the properties of the Higgs boson, probing dark matter by searching for supersymmetry, and exploring the unknown by looking for such proposed effects as large extra space-time dimensions."
0.044862,"Newton's constant, G, is the fundamental constant which determines the attractive gravitational force between masses. It is by far the least well known of the fundamental constants of nature. Disturbingly, measurements of G in recent decades by laboratories world-wide have yielded numerical values which differ among themselves by far more than their assigned uncertainties. In response to this situation a week-long ""Ideas Lab"" is to be conducted at NIST (National Institute of Science and Technology) to bring together scientists from a wide range of scientific disciplines to explore ways to make a new definitive and accurate measurement of this fundamental constant. The best ideas so developed will be incorporated in proposals for anticipated NSF funding. As our understanding of theoretical physics advances it is likely that there will come a time when an accurately known value of G will test theories that attempt to unify gravitation with quantum theory. In the meantime, understanding the subtleties involved in precisely and absolutely measuring a small force is important for many fields of physics and metrology. Indeed, the disagreement of recently measured G values suggests the remote possibility of fundamentally misunderstood properties of the instruments used to measure them, whose understanding could have important consequences for physical theories.<br/><br/>An NSF ""Ideas Lab"", Measuring ""Big G"" Challenge, is to be held July 18-22, 2016 at NIST's Gaithersburg facility. Participants drawn from a wide range of scientific disciplines will work together to explore ways to make new definitive measurements of Newton's fundamental constant G. The most promising ideas will lead to collaborative proposals to NSF for funding. The initial NSF grant will cover registration, travel and lodging for about 20 Lab participants (15 invited participants plus 5 Director(s) and Mentors) and registration. These expenditures will be administered by the University of California, Irvine."
0.12,"The research funded by this award is designed to promote a better understanding of atomic nuclei, the basic building blocks of all normal matter in the Universe. How did they form following the Big Bang, and how do they now interact to change their basic elemental nature? Are there new forms of matter made up from very exotic types of atomic nuclei and how might we make and study these? To this end the group will develop special new techniques in nuclear science, as well as train future scientists that can help answer some of these questions. One important training component will be a continuation of the well-established and highly successful outreach to faculty and students at New Buffalo High School in Michigan that has introduced these students to interesting, important, and exciting careers in the sciences. The technology developed and used in this research will have applications in other important areas, such as homeland security (nuclear terrorism), the safe storage and monitoring of nuclear wastes, and applications in nuclear medicine, including radiation therapy. The latter includes a new modality directly related to this research: the production and imaging of ion beams to treat particular forms of cancer tumors. Nearly 50% of graduate students and other personnel trained in the group's past research projects are currently pursuing careers in nuclear security or nuclear medicine, and it is anticipated that this will continue as a result of the present grant.<br/><br/>The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing stable as well as short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies. This includes use of the TwinSol low-energy radioactive ion-beam facility in operation at the University of Notre Dame (ND), developed jointly by the University of Michigan (UM) and ND. Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability to elucidate the effect that the exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier. Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity to the continuum is the characteristic defining feature of weakly-bound systems. These studies will be carried out at TwinSol in collaboration with a group from the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), utilizing a prototype active-target time-projection chamber (AT-TPC). A related program will use the full AT-TPC recently commissioned at the reaccelerated beam facility (ReA3) at NSCL. <br/><br/>In addition, the UM-UND collaboration, under the primary direction of the UM research group and their colleagues, will continue advanced development and application of deuterated scintillators for nuclear measurements involving neutrons. This will include selected measurements of (d,n) and (3He,n) reactions involving both stable and unstable beams, and in particular 7Be(d,n) which is of interest in astrophysics. Since these detectors permit neutron spectroscopy and cross section measurements without neutron time-of-flight, they have a particular advantage when used with the high-intensity, low-energy, non-pulsed accelerators suitable for nuclear astrophysics measurements. The latter includes the new 5 MV accelerator recently installed at ND and we will pursue such experiments, and in particular several key (A,n) measurements, together with the nuclear astrophysics group at ND. <br/><br/>The unique neutron detector array the group has recently developed has potential for wide-spread applications both in nuclear science as well as in homeland-security and nuclear non-proliferation. As in the past, the proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from ND and UM, together with faculty members and students from several primarily undergraduate schools located in close proximity to these universities. The highly-technical nature of the proposed research will thus contribute significantly to the training of a technically-literate work force."
0.359492,"Because 18 of the 20 amino acids are encoded at the DNA level with multiple synonymous codons, the genetic code used during protein synthesis is highly redundant -- a codon is the sequence of three DNA base pairs coding an amino acid. While it is well known that proteins can be encoded by different synonymous codons, the role of this redundant code on the efficiency of protein synthesis has remained unclear. Remarkably, the investigator found that under nutrient starvation, synonymous codons played very distinct roles on both synthesis levels and the variations from one cell to another of the quantity of synthetized proteins. Some codons were found to be robust to the limitation of certain amino acids, allowing for stronger protein expression, while others were sensitive to this limitation yielding low levels of protein expression. Importantly, cells are believed to starve during the formation of bacterial biofilms or during cancerous proliferation for which synonymous codons should play an important role in regulating protein synthesis. Therefore, the goal of this project is to quantify and establish the role of synonymous codons in protein synthesis during starvation of nutrients. The training of students with scientific backgrounds in mathematics or biology is an important component of this effort. Students will have the opportunity for hands-on participation in dynamics simulation of gene expression extracted from data made possible by this project. <br/><br/>Over the last decade, there has been considerable interest from physicists and biologists to develop a quantitative framework to predict the stochastic behavior of gene expression at the single cell level. In bacteria, a clear picture has emerged: noise in gene expression is mainly caused by transcriptional bursts that are Poisson distributed and translation solely amplifies these fluctuations. While this canonical model holds when bacteria grow in rich media, it fails to explain the observed noise when bacteria are exposed to environmental perturbations such as nutrient limitation. The outcome of this project will be to create a novel physical framework to predict the noise in gene expression governed by the in-sequence distribution of sensitive synonymous codons under environmental perturbations. Here the investigator proposes to characterize the noise associated with robust and sensitive codons when used to encode the expression of the yellow fluorescent protein. Firstly, the investigator will focus on quantifying the stochastic cell-to-cell behavior in gene expression arising from synonymous codon choice. Secondly, work will be done to identify how the dynamics associated with the translation of synonymous sensitive codons exhibits near-critical behavior. Finally, the third aim examines the contribution of the variations of key intracellular parameters as control parameters of noise driven by synonymous codons under well-characterized environmental perturbations.<br/><br/>This award is supported jointly by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
5,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond a dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.<br/><br/>This award will provide support for the design and fabrication of a next-generation (G2) experiment, SuperCDMS SNOLAB, which will operate at the deepest large clean underground laboratory in the world. The high background rejection and control of contamination that the SuperCDMS technology offers provide significant advantages compared to other technologies. The baseline design for this new experiment will deploy an initial 50 kg payload of germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) detectors. Some of these detectors will be operated in a manner that provides very low energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to the lowest dark matter particle masses (< 0.5 GeV) and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment. It will provide a strong possibility of the discovery of particle dark matter and detailed information on its properties.<br/><br/>This award will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies. SuperCDMS scientists will continue their involvement in public outreach, collaboration with K-12 teachers, and support for Berkeley physics majors who are training to teach science and for promising high school students from underserved backgrounds."
0.4,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Marc Kamionkowski and David E. Kaplan at Johns Hopkins University. <br/><br/>The aim of particle physics is to understand the fundamental laws of physics and the rules that govern the behavior of all physical systems in the Universe. The traditional avenues for progress in this endeavor have over the past century been experiments at particle colliders, the most recent such experiment being the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a major international collaboration with significant US participation. Another avenue has been to use observations of astrophysical systems, as well as the Universe as a whole, as a laboratory for fundamental physics, as these cosmic systems must also obey the laws of physics. In their research, Professors Kamionkowski and Kaplan aim to develop new hypotheses about the fundamental laws of physics and to develop analytic tools to capitalize fully, in our effort to uncover new physical laws, upon the nation's investment in collider and cosmic experiments. Research on this subject advances the national interest by promoting the advancement of science in its most fundamental direction. It also advances the national interest by attracting young talent to STEM fields and providing them with powerful analytic tools in order to drive the type of innovation that drives economic progress. This project will also have broader impacts through the training of graduate students who will serve as apprentices in the research. Professors Kamionkowski and Kaplan also intend to be engaged energetically in public education through public lectures, films and videos, online tools, and popular articles.<br/><br/>More technically, Prof. Kamionkowski will explore models for dark energy inspired by the string axiverse. These dark-energy models often involve not only axion-like quintessence fields but also other fields that may have small but subtle dynamical effects in the early Universe. Prof. Kamionkowski will explore a suite of techniques based on measurements from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy surveys, as well as assorted searches for axion-like fields, to search for evidence of these dark-energy models. Kamionkowski also plans to study new ideas for dark matter. The implications of these limits for direct and indirect detection and the implications for CMB fluctuations, CMB spectral distortions, and 21-cm fluctuations from the dark ages will be explored. Prof. Kaplan plans to explore new approaches to the hierarchy problem in which a scalar field tunnels between vacua, thereby exploring a vast range of values for the Higgs mass. The convergence of the scanning to our Higgs mass is a consequence of a back reaction due to the scanning of negative as well as positive mass-squared. Prof. Kaplan will also develop a tree-level model of flavor of the Froggatt-Nielsen variety which could reproduce the Standard-Model fermion spectrum and would make predictions for flavor-changing neutral currents at future b-quark factories or tests of lepton-flavor violation. In addition to the training of students, numerous Broader Impacts of this project are envisioned. Kaplan will tell additional stories of particle physics with remnant footage from his recent film, ""Particle Fever""; serve as advisor to several other science films and TV shows; and prepare a set of brief online physics tutorials. Kamionkowski will remain active as a public spokesperson for CMB science, do editorial work for prominent science journals, and serve on several advisory committees. Both Kamionkowski and Kaplan participate in the Johns Hopkins Quarknet program which engages Baltimore-area high-school teachers and students in cutting edge research."
0.37,"Precise experimental tests of fundamental particle properties are now a well-established way to search for new laws of nature beyond our current physical knowledge. The proposed research is for two experiments to make precise measurements of an elementary particle called the muon, which is similar to the electron but with larger mass. One experiment at tha Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, called g-2, will measure the magnetic moment of the muon to an accuracy of better than a part-per-million, which will provide a test of the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that explains the properties of the elementary particles making up most of the visible matter in the Universe. The other experiment, called MuSun, at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland will measure the lifetime of an atom comprised of a muon and a deuteron (a nucleus made from one proton and one neutron). This experiment will further the knowledge of the reaction of thermonuclear hydrogen burning which powers the sun, as well as helping to understand neutrino interactions with matter.<br/><br/>The muon g-2 experiment will measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment to 140 parts-per-billion, a four-fold improvement over the previous experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), known as E821. The measurement will address the longstanding 3 standard deviation discrepancy between the same measurement from E821 and the Standard Model prediction. It represents a key test of the Standard Model and has broad sensitivity to new particles and interactions beyond the Standard Model. The muon g-2 project has involved the relocation of the muon storage ring from Brookhaven National Laboratory to Fermilab as well as new detector, electronics and acquisition systems. The PI and his group are responsible for the 8 GByte/sec calorimeter readout, using multi-teraflop GPU-based data processing, and distributed event building for the data acquisition system. The MuSun experiment will measure the mu- d to n n neutrino doublet capture rate to an accuracy of 1.5%. The measurement addresses a longstanding discrepancy among earlier measurements of mu d capture. It will provide a five-fold improvement in our knowledge of the two-body weak axial currents that plays a role in pp thermonuclear fusion, cross sections for neutrino experiments, and ordinary and double beta-decay."
0.227426,"This project involves the study of small molecules and how they interact with different atoms. In one experiment, a laser is used to give the molecules a precisely defined amount of vibrational and rotational energy. The molecules, which are in a small chamber, then have close encounters (collisions) with various other atoms (helium, argon, or potassium) that are also present in the chamber. A second laser is used to determine how the forces between the atoms and the molecules affect the vibration and rotation of the molecules. In a second experiment, lasers are used to measure the energy levels and other properties of the molecules. The results of both experiments will be compared with computer models based on the theory of quantum mechanics in order to test the understanding of how atoms and molecules interact. The proposed work is relevant to research in other areas of current interest, such as quantum computing and laser cooling of atoms and molecules. It will also contribute to the advanced education of several students. Three or four graduate students will write Ph.D. dissertations based on this work, and approximately six undergraduate students will participate in these projects during the summers through Lehigh University's REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program. <br/><br/>The specific activities that will be carried out involve measurements of the ro-vibrational energy levels of triplet states of NaCs and NaK, and the investigation of fine and hyperfine structure of these levels. The goal is to map out potential energy curves and transition dipole moments as functions of internuclear separation, to study spin-orbit and non-adiabatic coupling between states, and to use patterns of energy levels to investigate predissociation and other fundamental molecular interactions. In one such effort, the supported research group is developing a technique using quantum interference effects to determine detailed information about molecular perturbations. The interacting NaCs 11(0+) and 12(0+) states are being used as the test case. The group is currently extending their work to NaCs, because it is of interest for cooling and trapping. The large spin-orbit interactions in this molecule, which lead to strong perturbations and avoided crossings, provide interesting new challenges for both experiment and theory. In addition, the group's recent studies of rotationally inelastic collisions of alkali molecules have revealed a strong propensity for Delta J = even transitions in collisions of NaK molecules with either Ar or He atoms. However, this propensity is not observed in collisions of NaK with K atoms. The group has found that orientation is largely preserved in rotationally inelastic collisions of NaK with Ar or He, but is almost completely destroyed in collisions with potassium. The group's theoretical calculations are beginning to provide explanations for these results. Recent calculations predict strong J dependences in the probabilities for transfer of either orientation or alignment in rotationally inelastic collisions. Further experiments will test many of these predictions and provide stringent tests of molecular collision theory."
0.225,"An area of fundamental research is the study of the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms and exotic atoms (atoms where one particle such as an electron is replaced by another such as a muon). Experiments have become more and more accurate, testing the theory at a stronger and stronger level. This supplies a test of our understanding of the physics of these systems. This project will calculate energy levels for systems where there have been discrepancies between theory and experiment. The theoretical results obtained in this research will find applications in the analysis of the forthcoming experimental results on muonic and electronic atoms and ions. This analysis will result in more precise values of the fundamental physical constants, especially the proton radius, as well as radii of the deuteron and alpha particles. These values will find applications in metrology and nuclear physics. New theoretical expressions will be used in the new CODATA analysis of the fundamental physical constants. In its turn CODATA compilations of the fundamental constants are used in every science classroom, and in numerous fields of science and engineering, from fundamental research to consumer electronics. Graduate and undergraduate students participating in this research will acquire research, computer, problem solving, and presentation skills. Research activity of a graduate student is expected to lead to a PhD thesis. This project will promote international collaboration, as collaboration with foreign scientists is planned. The results of the proposed research will be published in refereed journals, will be presented at domestic and international conferences and workshops, and will be used in teaching graduate courses.<br/><br/>High precision quantum electrodynamics of hydrogenlike bound states is an active field of theoretical research, motivated both by spectacular experimental progress and the intellectual challenge. Despite significant progress in the theory of light, hydrogenlike bound states, there are a number of challenging problems in this field that are addressed in this project. Search for a theoretical explanation of the discrepancy between the value of the proton charge radius obtained from the experiment with muonic hydrogen and the proton charge radius derived from hydrogen spectroscopy and electron-proton scattering is one of the main objectives. Irrespective of the way the proton charge radius controversy will be resolved, an extensive program of research on energy splittings in light muonic atoms and ions (muonic hydrogen, muonic deuterium, and muonic helium ions) is in order to match current and forthcoming experimental results. Methods of nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum electrodynamics will be applied to loosely bound two-particle systems in the proposed research. Theoretical results of the proposed research together with the theoretical results of other authors and with the results of the past and ongoing experiments would allow the determination of more precise values for many fundamental physical constants: the proton charge radius, the Rydberg constant, electron-muon and electron-proton mass ratios, etc."
0.66,"High energy physics (HEP) experiments use extremely large data sets to study the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces that govern their interactions. To use computing resources most effectively, the investigators will study algorithms and develop codes that run well on computers which provide especially high performance for parallel execution of instructions, including general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and other many-core/multi-core architectures. These studies, and the community tools to be developed here, will extend the quantitative reach in HEP and allied fields to the point where they enable qualitative advances. To enhance the broader impact of this work, the investigators will distribute the statistical analysis toolkit as Free and Open Source Software. In addition, the investigators will disseminate their results about effectively writing GPU-friendly algorithms via talks, short courses, and journal articles.<br/><br/>The specific HEP context for this project will be developing tools for analyzing data from the next generation of experiments. The last major elements of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics (which describes the electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear interactions of fundamental particles) have been experimentally validated in the past decade. Detailed measurements of particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the decays of B-mesons by the BABAR and Belle collaborations led to Kobayashi and Maskawa sharing the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. The ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN discovered a Higgs-like boson in 2012, leading to Englert and Higgs sharing the 2013 Nobel prize in physics. The codes and toolkits to be developed here will enable HEP experiments to search more effectively for phenomena not described by the SM, sometimes called Beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics. ATLAS and CMS are searching for direct evidence of BSM physics at the highest energies. Belle-II, the next generation electron-positron flavor factory being built in Japan, has a design luminosity two orders of magnitude greater than that of Belle, providing complementary BSM sensitivity in very high statistics studies of B-meson decays, charm mixing, and searches for lepton flavor violation. The LHCb experiment at CERN has already surpassed BaBar and Belle by more than an order of magnitude in many channels, and the resulting BSM constraints complement those from ATLAS and CMS. Analyzing the data from all these experiments will require disproportionately more computing power at a modest increase in cost. In addition to developing generally useful tools, the statistical analysis toolkit developed here will be applied to analyze data from LHCb."
0.015,"Pre-Ionization Controlled Laser Plasma Formation for Ignition Applications<br/>Azer Yalin (Colorado State University), Anthony Marchese (Colorado State University), Mikhail Shneider (Princeton University), Zhili Zhang (University of Tennessee - Knoxville)<br/><br/>This award is made in response to a proposal submitted to and reviewed under the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering joint solicitation NSF 13-596. The award provides funds to support undergraduate participation in the overall research effort, which is being funded separately by the DOE under contract to Princeton University contract (Grant Number TBD)."" <br/><br/>Broader Significance and Importance: Plasmas formed from focused laser beams provide reactive heated volumes of gas, somewhat analogous to the sparks produced by conventional ignition systems. Laser plasmas, therefore, are of interest for a number of applications including ignition. We will develop the basic plasma science to provide tailored laser pulse schemes for ignition and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) applications. In terms of combustion, laser ignition has many potential benefits. For reciprocating natural gas engines one can ignite leaner mixtures (reducing NOx emissions and pollutant formation) and higher pressure mixtures (leading to higher engine efficiencies and fuel-savings). In aerospace applications one can achieve better relight in aero-turbines. The multi-pulse approaches may lower the burden on required laser sources and fiber delivery implementations. We will present our activities to local minority-serving public schools (K-12) and include research advances in courses at our universities. We will specifically target underrepresented or minority groups to work on the project as their Ph.D. thesis research.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The proposed research focuses on innovative approaches employing pre-ionizing pulses (ns-ps-fs) to enhance and control laser plasma formation in gases. In particular, we will examine cases in which an initial pulse is used to achieve pre-ionization, and is followed by a second pulse that provides controllable energy addition. The energy addition of the second pulse is enabled by pre-ionization due to the first pulse. The result will be a laser plasma that is not at full breakdown conditions (i.e. no spark), but that has elevated temperature (>~2000 K). Such laser plasmas can provide novel and improved ignition sources by avoiding the unnecessarily high temperatures, strong shock waves, and elevated laser pulse energies that accompany full laser breakdown (sparks). We will consider a range of pulse durations (ns-ps-fs) as well as both non-resonant and resonant schemes for pre-ionization. We will also study both non-resonant pre-ionizing pulses as well as Resonant Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) schemes. The REMPI schemes will be developed for future applications in air with initial studies in synthetic gas mixtures, e.g. we will study REMPI of argon and oxygen which are abundant in air. The plasmas will be experimentally studied and characterized as well as modeled numerically. We will determine optimal laser pulse parameters (wavelength, duration, temporal separation etc.) to provide sufficient pre-ionization and to allow subsequent energy addition. Owing to the lack of visible emission, the study of such plasmas is challenging and a key feature of our proposal is the use of a newly developed microwave scattering technique to measure electron parameters. The proposed research will be transformative in terms of laser plasma formation; despite a large body of research in laser breakdown using single laser pulses there has been minimal research on multi-pulse approaches and pre-ionization. The three-year program will be conducted by Colorado State University (CSU), University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK), and Princeton University (PU) and combines experimental studies, advanced diagnostics, and computational plasma and combustion modeling."
0.18,"Over the past decade, extraordinary advances in the field of time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy have enabled investigations of simple atoms with an unprecedented time resolution of the electron motion within the atoms, resolution that approaches one attosecond (one attosecond is a billionth of a billionth of a second). This project extends these investigations to more complex targets, such as adsorbate-covered solid surfaces and nanoparticles. These investigations of the dynamics of electron emission from atoms and complex target at the natural time scale of the electronic motion in matter relates to both established and emerging fields of research and technology. Time-resolved studies of the electronic dynamics in matter will promote the comprehensive understanding of i) elementary physical processes, such as single-electron and collective electronic excitations and ii) the dynamics of electrons and electric fields in metals, semiconductors, and catalytic surfaces, (bio-) molecules, and nanoparticles. These research projects are thus likely to deepen our insight into photochemical processes and chemical reaction dynamics at surfaces. They have a strong educational component by training students and postdocs in applying concepts as well as mathematical and numerical techniques used in modern atomic, optical, surface, and computational physics. Our research efforts may have a transformative impact on emerging technologies, such as ultrafast light-wave computing, nanocatalysis, and artificial photosynthesis, thereby contributing to the development of novel ultrafast computers and efficient catalytic devices needed to secure our energy supply.<br/><br/>Attosecond streaking spectroscopy has led to impressive time-resolved studies of atomic ionization and is anticipated to significantly advance our understanding of electronic properties of molecules, layered--semiconductor structures, and nanoparticles. However, the detailed physical interpretation of streaked spectra faces significant conceptual challenges and necessitates comprehensive theoretical investigations, even for simple atomic systems. For complex systems, additional severe technical difficulties in describing the transiently photoexcited electronic dynamics in molecules and solids must be overcome. This research addresses these challenges and focuses on the modeling of time-resolved photoemission from atoms, adsorbate-covered metal surfaces, and nanoparticles. It examines streaked photoemission spectra in order to systematically analyze the role of (i) electronic correlation, (ii) electron propagation, and (iii) collective electronic excitation and relaxation effects during and after the photoemission process. We will develop and apply complementary quantum--mechanical methods: exact numerical solutions of the time--dependent Schrödinger equation and physically more transparent analytical (S--matrix) quantum-mechanical methods. Effective potentials for surfaces and nanoparticles will be modeled based on density-functional theory. They will serve as input for full three--dimensional calculations of the electronic dynamics during the interaction of intense IR and XUV light pulses with matter. New numerical methods will be explored and implemented, allowing for the modeling of increasingly complex samples. Furthermore, we will assess the degree to which streaked photoelectron spectroscopy can reveal information on (a) electronic forces and dynamics in solids and at solid interfaces and (b) non?homogenous nanoplasmonic electric--field enhancements in response to an incident IR streaking pulse. Supported by numerical modeling, attosecond time-resolved measurements promise novel methods to prepare, probe, and control electronic excitations and the formation and breaking of chemical bonds in complex systems."
0.225,"Typical atoms and molecules in a gas are compact and nearly impervious to all but the strongest electric and magnetic fields that can be applied in a laboratory, and they hardly interact with each other except for the rare cases when they pass within tiny distances of each other. Using simple lasers, one of the electrons in an atom or molecule can acquire so much energy that it is only barely bound to the atom or molecule. An atom with such a weakly bound electron is called a Rydberg atom after Johannes Rydberg who gave a mathematical description of the allowed energies. Because the electron is weakly attached to the atom or molecule, its properties can be controlled using modest fields that are easily accessible. Also, the interaction between two or more Rydberg atoms is millions of times larger than is usual which gives interesting atom-atom effects even for a dilute gas.<br/><br/>The main technical goal of this project is to calculate the properties of a single Rydberg atom in static electric or magnetic fields or in laser fields and to calculate the properties of many interacting Rydberg atoms. Within the past decade, there have been an increasing number of experimental groups investigating different arrangements of Rydberg atoms or molecules and fields. One of the general goals of this project is to provide understanding of the experimental results and/or to propose new arrangements worth studying. The reason for investigating a Rydberg atom in different fields is that there is nearly full external control of this quantum system so that it is possible to learn what properties of the interaction control how energy and/or particles move within a closed system. There is a similar reason for studying many interacting Rydberg atoms: the flow of energy through a purely quantum is a fundamental question and is worth studying in different situations. Lastly, there have been several proposals to use Rydberg atoms as components in quantum computers and/or as non-linear optical devices. Thus, studies which use state-of-the-art computational techniques could aid in the understanding of the feasibility of these proposals.<br/><br/>This project will investigate several situations where the exaggerated electronic properties of Rydberg atoms are the main common feature. Calculations for systems that consist of a single Rydberg atom exposed to strong fields as well as many Rydberg atoms that interact through their large electric dipole moments will be performed. For all of the systems, the group will use either fully quantum or a mixture of quantum and classical methods in the calculations. The main long term goal of this project is to develop theoretical and computational tools that allow the quantitative description of complex quantum phenomena. The calculations proposed involve highly excited states where the many nodes of the wave function allow for complex phenomena or involve many body systems where the correlations between particles lead to nontrivial dynamics. At a basic level, this goal is a fundamental goal of nearly all atomic theory proposals. Thus, the lessons learned in these studies could be of wide interest. Also, understanding these systems could allow for experimental control of complex states and many body systems.<br/><br/>There are a couple of projects that investigate how a single Rydberg atom behaves when exposed to strong fields. The first situation is when an atom is exposed to the structured potential that arises in a bottle-beam trap; when the nucleus is off-center, this potential has little symmetry with respect to the nucleus so that nearly all states are mixed together. The second situation is to understand the role that quantum friction (in the form of spontaneous emission) plays in a driven quantum system; this system is interesting because the classical dynamics leads to the oscillator locking to the drive. The classical motion does not decay out of the O-point and, thus, can remain forever with high energy even though 'friction' is present. The projects involving two or more interacting Rydberg atoms focus on separate aspects of this system but invoke similar computational tools and theoretical ideas. One project is to study the kick an atom receives due to Rydberg-Rydberg interactions, especially for blockaded systems. This kick arises due to the finite interaction energy between the atoms and could have implications for quantum computation schemes. Another project is to study Anderson localization in a Rydberg gas: the randomness in the placement of atoms translates into a randomness in the hopping amplitude of an excitation. A goal is to understand how the 1/R3 dependence in the hopping amplitude affects the basic properties of Anderson localization. Another project is to understand the role that near-field versus far-field dipole-dipole interactions play within a Rydberg gas. By systematically varying the types of states participating in the dipole-dipole interaction, one can tune the system from predominantly near-field (states with large principle quantum number) to far-field (states with small principle quantum number). Lastly, calculations of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms with large electric dipole moments aligned along an external electric field and how it affects the relative motion of the atoms will be performed. This will investigate whether it is possible to vary the direction of the electric field in a rapid, time dependent manner so that the atoms form a dynamically stable molecule."
0.405,"Gordon Moore, the founder of Intel, was the first to note that the number of transistors per chip roughly doubled every two years (this is called Moore's Law). The corresponding volume per transistor had to decrease exponentially with time. Miniaturization would eventually lead to such a small number of electrons per transistor that the discriminable charging effect of the electrons in a transistor fails. The point where miniaturization destroys the transistor function is known as Moore's limit. This limit is imminent within the next generation of scientists and engineers. New avenues of progress beyond current technology must be sought. This research follows the approach of quantum technology to continue the evolution of information processing beyond Moore's limit. It works to develop the necessary foundational knowledge for an approach to devices, where the behavior of these devices is governed not by the usual rules that govern the aggregate properties of a large number of particles, but by the laws of quantum mechanics, which governs electrons in the atomic limit. Specifically, this project focuses on the study of optically controlled semiconductor quantum dots. A dot effectively traps one electron, which is manipulated by ultrafast pulses of light that enable terahertz control speeds without the complexities of metal contacts. The studies emphasize the isolation of the electron from the influence of the other electrons (known as the valence electrons) and the nuclei, in particular, which constitute the dot, and the networking of the target electrons in separate dots. Light is used to excite the valence electrons to control a single target electron and to entangle two target electrons, while shielding them from the effects of nuclear fluctuations. The primary intellectual merit is based on the scientific objectives of this three-year research program; produce quantum entangled states between two electron spins separated by a large distance, demonstrate a multi-quantum-bit high-speed logic gate, and explore the feasibility of using optical control of nuclear states to store and or process information. The broader impact includes developing the basic knowledge to advance the technology of information processing beyond Moore's limit via a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative research program, training and preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers for new challenges they will be facing, and facilitating efforts by both our universities to inform and educate the public and students about the importance of this quantum research to society's well-being, including how this research is training students in STEM areas in order to maintain a competitive work force. <br/><br/>This research focuses on quantum information processing by ultrafast optical control of electron spins trapped individually in structurally defined semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Numerous advances made possible by previous NSF support, have helped meet many of the milestones of quantum operations required by the Di Vincenzo criteria. Recent advances such as demonstration of the flying qubit and nuclear spin fluctuation freezing to extend the electron-spin coherence time and creation of high optical quality laterally positioned dots are fundamental to the quantum network approach to scaling up the system. The critical discovery of nuclear spin fluctuation freezing enables lengthening the coherence time of the qubit by over 2-3 orders of magnitude for time scales lasting longer than 1 second. This allows the time for a complete sequence of computational steps with the ultrafast control including error correction. The method consists in freezing out the fluctuations of the nuclear spins unavoidably present in QDs and temporally separates the decoherence abatement from the control operations, in contrast to the common but more limited and complex method of dynamic decoupling of the qubits being processed at the same time. Building on these achievements five experimental objectives to advance the frontier of scalable quantum information processing based on optical control of the spins will be accomplished: demonstrate a two-bit controlled not-gate and of a simple algorithm using a quantum dot molecule; demonstrate teleportation of information in a single photon qubit to a QD using spontaneous parametric (singe-photon) down conversion (SPDC) to produce the single photon source; produce an entangled state between a quantum dot spin and a spontaneously emitted photon (at 960nm) and convert it to the telecom wavelength around 1.55 microns; demonstrate heralded entanglement of two QD spins using photons.; and extend the work on nuclear spin fluctuation freezing to using optically detected NMR to more completely understand the underlying physics state of nuclei in the dot. <br/><br/>The work is an interdisciplinary research effort in the physics of semiconductor nano-structures, high-precision coherent optical control, and spectroscopy of QDs. These studies are paralleled by the coherent transient time domain studies consistent with device applications and scalable architectures. The amelioration of the environmental problem (decoherence) lies in the coordinated theoretical and experimental treatment of the quantum correlated dynamics of the optically controlled electron spin and the nuclear spins in the QD through the hyperfine interaction without additional stochastic assumptions.The intellectual merit arises from the increasingly sophisticated understanding of the interaction effects between a microscopic system (the electron spins as the qubits) and a macroscopic system (the dot environment, control or measurement) within quantum theory. The broad bandwidth control of the quantum physics makes the QD system the high speed processing unit partner to the quantum memory device of trapped ions. The operating temperature of 4-10 K is above the milli-K required by gated dots and superconducting circuits and optical control avoids some of the connection problems.<br/><br/>The broader impact is first in the development of highly trained people critical to the infrastructure of quantum technology, at all levels of higher education: postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students. The second broader impact is that the optical approach positions our research to play a key role in the transition from the electronic devices that currently drive the Moore?s law to the new paradigm of post CMOS era. The further miniaturization of the current devices that process classical information will reach the quantum barrier where devices operating on quantum information will take over. The future lies in a hybrid structure of classical devices for interface with human and quantum devices for information processing. The optical approach to quantum devices, based on the established III-V material with a large industrial infrastructure and optical sources and gating based on telecom technology, may provide a smooth transition to the hybrid structure."
0.27085,"A fundamental goal of subatomic physics is the precise determination of the physical properties of subatomic particles. The radius of the proton is one of these properties. The radius can be measured by scattering electrons or muons from protons, or by measuring the energy levels of hydrogen or muonic hydrogen, an atom in which the electron is replaced by a muon. To date, the radius has been measured by scattering of electrons, and by the energy levels of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. The muonic measurements disagree with the electronic measurements, an issue known as ""the proton radius puzzle."" The discrepancy has attracted wide attention, because it may indicate the existence of previously unobserved and unexpected differences between the interactions of muons and electrons.<br/><br/>A dedicated MUon proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE), which will run at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland and directly compare the scattering of muons and electrons from protons, is highly anticipated by experts in the field for its potential to resolve the puzzle. This project will cover the prototyping and development of several crucial components of the MUSE experiment detectors. This project will involve the training of students and young scientists, at the undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and junior faculty levels. The institutions involved in this project have trained large numbers of students of each type, including from minority populations. The training they have received in the process of doing basic research has led to careers in a variety of areas, from medical physics to national security, in addition to continued work in fundamental physics research. The MUSE experiment will broaden the perspective of American students by having them work in an international collaboration at an international laboratory, which will prepare them effectively to become prominent global scientists of the next generation. With the broad interest in the proton radius puzzle, MUSE has the potential to be broadly inspirational beyond the current scientific community.<br/><br/>The experiment uses a mixed beam of electrons, muons, and pions. The measurement requires high precision and small systematic errors. This project will build and test the components of the detector system. These include scintillation fiber detectors to measure the trajectories of incoming particles, Cerenkov detectors for particle identification, GEM detectors for precise positioning, straw tube detectors for measuring the trajectories of scattered particles, and scintillation detectors for particle identification of the scattered particles. In addition, a liquid hydrogen target will be developed. Development and testing of these detectors will demonstrate that the required precision can be obtained."
0.197,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."

4.51,"This award provides three-year continued support for the experimental particle physics and astroparticle physics programs at Michigan State University. The intellectual merit deals with the completion of the final chapter of the 1967 Standard Model and its necessary evolution through physics studies at D0 and CDF at the Tevatron at Fermilab, ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the NuMI Off-axis neutrino Appearance (NOvA) experiment at Fermilab and Ash River, MN, and the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) experiment at the Gamma Ray Observatory at the Sierra Negra in Mexico. The primary research focus is new experiments: ATLAS, HAWC, and NOvA with a selective physics program at D0 and CDF to the completion of the Tevatron program. The broader impacts of this work include the opportunity to bring these front-line research questions into classrooms and to the public at large through lectures and interactive video presentations. In addition, the group engages more than a dozen graduate students and a number of undergraduates into the labs at MSU, Fermilab, and CERN providing unique experiences for students who are often not physics majors."
0.482565,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Sumit Das and Alfred Shapere at the University of Kentucky.<br/><br/>This project involves the use of techniques of string theory and quantum field theory to understand quantum properties of gravity and properties of systems near phase transitions. In recent years, physicists have discovered an intimate relationship between quantum gravity as described by string theory and conventional quantum systems. This relationship has been used to understand many equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of rather complicated systems near phase transitions, like superconductors or colliding heavy ions at high temperature, using methods of string theory. The present proposal involves novel methods which will shed light on properties of these systems far from equilibrium. At the same time, the proposal aims to develop a deeper understanding of the quantum aspects of gravity by relating such aspects to systems which can be investigated using conventional methods of quantum mechanics. In a parallel direction, powerful methods of supersymmetry will be used to classify phase transitions and their related universal behavior.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include the training of graduate students and postdocs in cutting-edge research techniques and preparing them for research careers. The investigators will give lectures and seminars on their research which are open to all, and will incorporate ideas gleaned from their research activities in the courses they teach. The investigators will also continue their work to modernize the University of Kentucky's physics curriculum and to bring its students into contact with frontier research in these subjects."
0.18,"This project focuses on understanding theoretically the interaction of intense coherent laser radiation with electrons, atoms, and molecules and on investigating the use of ultrafast laser or electron pulses to image time-dependent electronic processes in atoms and molecules. The basic research supported by this project contributes broadly to our understanding of means to control matter on an atomic scale. Investigations involving ultrashort pulses of electrons may lead to ways of resolving electron motion in atoms and molecules both temporally and spatially. In ""seeing"" how electrons move and interact with light, scientists will be better able to eventually control the electron motion, thereby leading to important applications in improving the efficiency of such key processes as solar energy conversion and photosynthesis, and in combining optical and electronic processes (e.g., the emerging new field of optoelectronics) to make much faster switches that in turn would enable much faster computers. The analyses of ways to increase the intensities of high order harmonics may one day lead to sources of coherent x-rays, thus providing a new means for visualizing living biological structures as well as nanoscale materials structures. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved with this project are given a broad education in theoretical atomic physics, first-hand experience in all aspects of scientific communication, and in teaching undergraduates at a large Big 10 Land Grant university. Project results are not only published in leading physics journals and presented at national and international meetings, but are also periodically distilled and integrated with related work by others in review articles written by the PI and collaborators. All graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved with this project in the past have been sought after by a variety of other employers, including technology companies, medical researchers, and other leading AMO theory groups.<br/><br/>The processes included in this project are difficult to treat theoretically because the interactions of electrons with both intense laser fields and with atomic and molecular potentials are difficult to describe accurately; also, their interactions with ultrashort laser or electron pulses must be described time-dependently. This group has developed a number of theoretical approaches to overcome these difficulties. In particular, they have solved essentially exactly the problem of a weakly bound electron in a short-range potential interacting with an intense laser field, and the results obtained for this particular system can be accurately generalized to the case of other atomic and molecular systems. They have also developed theoretical approaches for simulating the interaction of ultrashort electron pulses with time-dependent states of atoms and molecules. <br/><br/>Specific investigations supported in this project include: (1) using ultrashort duration electron pulses as both temporal and spatial probes of electronic motion in atoms; (2) investigating intense laser-assisted or laser-induced electron scattering, electron recombination, and electron bremsstrahlung processes; (3) developing analytic formulas for high-order harmonic generation for molecules for both long and short laser pulses in the long-wavelength approximation, investigating analytic formulas for two-color harmonic generation spectra in atoms, and investigating analytically zeptosecond interference features in harmonic spectra produced by long-wavelength lasers; and (4) investigating finite pulse effects in intense laser acceleration of electrons bound in highly-charged ions, and developing a combined quantum description of tunneling ionization with a classical relativistic description of laser acceleration of electrons initially bound in highly-charged ions."

However, it has not yet been directly detected and its identify remains a mystery. A leading candidate for dark matter would be a new elementary particle of nature, and identifying this particle is one of the foremost goals of modern science. The research within this project provides a crucial input to experiments that are searching for dark matter particles over the course of the next decade. <br/><br/>As the various experimental searches for particle dark matter increase in size and improve in sensitivity, new challenges will arise in attempts to extract a possible signal. For direct dark matter searches, an important background in the future will be the ""neutrino floor""; this is defined as the scale at which detectors are large enough to detect neutrinos produced from the Sun, atmosphere, and supernovae. Detectors are now fast approaching the scale at which these neutrinos will appear, so it is imperative to make a concerted effort towards understanding their spectra so that they may be properly identified. The funding under this award will be utilized to study theoretical and experimental methods to reduce the uncertainty on the neutrino backgrounds in dark matter detectors. The work will involve theoretical predictions, statistical data modeling, and analysis of many modern dark matter and neutrino experiments."
0.29,"The goal of this project is to investigate the science and technology of pulsed plasma processing of semiconductor wafers aimed towards developing a knowledge base that will enable pulsed plasmas to be optimized for materials modification. Plasma assisted materials processing is largely responsible for the impressive progress that continues to be made in production of microelectronics devices of ever increasing capability. Plasma etching is the only known, industrially implementable method to fabricate the nanometer sized features in logic and memory chips. During plasma etching, fluxes of ions and neutral particles are directed towards the wafer being processed. The energy and angle of impact of the particles onto the surface of wafers are the critical parameters for the fabrication of microelectronic devices, as well as nanostructured and biocompatible materials. Control of these parameters allows for finer control of the surface composition and, in microelectronics fabrication, etch rate. Low temperature plasmas for plasma materials processing have traditionally used continuously excited plasmas. However, all major semiconductor chip and equipment manufacturers are predicting that pulsed plasmas will be the enabling technology for achieving sub-10 nanometer feature sizes. The most direct impact of this research is addressing fundamental science issues that are of paramount importance to the plasma processing of high performance microelectronics, nanostructures and biocompatible materials. In addition to the technological broader impacts, this project will be highly focused on educational outreach. Prof. Gekelman is one of the founders of LAPTAG (Los Angeles Physics Teachers Alliance Group) and several LAPTAG students and will be involved in these plasma processing studies. Prof. Kushner, director of the Michigan Institute of Plasma Science and Engineering, will leverage those resources to launch the Plasma Picture of the Day website with the goal of providing informative images of plasmas to educate the general public and school children about plasmas.<br/><br/>The lack of fundamental understanding of the dynamics of pulsed plasma systems is the current impediment to widespread adoption. For example, instabilities and waves are nearly universally observed in pulsed plasmas, and particularly in electronegative plasmas, which sometimes prevents operation in desirable parameters spaces. The sources of these instabilities and the means to prevent them are not understood. Pulsed plasma processing can be arbitrarily complex. For example, modern capacitively coupled plasma etching tools may be driven by up to 3 separate power supplies at different frequencies which can be pulsed independently at different repetition rates and different duty cycles. The combinations of parameters can number into the millions. This extremely large parameter space places a large premium on having a fundamental understanding of pulsed plasma processing and so be able to predict plasma performance. In this research project, a highly collaborative experimental-modeling effort will investigate the fundamental properties of pulsed plasmas as used in materials processing, with an emphasis on instabilities and waves, diagnosing and modeling the dynamics of the transition from interpulse afterglow to powered plasma, and the means to improve uniformity through pulsing. Laser induced fluorescence will be used to characterize the trajectory of ions as they are accelerated through the transient sheaths produced by pulsed plasmas; and will be correlated with Langmuir probe measurements of plasma properties. Multi-dimensional computer modeling will be validated by these measurements and will be further used to illuminate fundamental issues related to plasma transport in pulsed systems."
0.135,"This proposal funds the research activities of Assistant Professor Jack Laiho at Syracuse University. Laiho's research focuses on precision studies of the interactions of quarks via the strong and weak nuclear forces. These forces are a part of the enormously successful Standard Model of particle physics. In order to compare the predictions of the Standard Model with experimental observations large-scale supercomputer calculations are required to correctly account for the effects of the strong nuclear force using an approach called Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Theoretical predictions of the Standard Model are compared with experimental results obtained from particle accelerator experiments, thus testing our understanding of the laws of nature. So far, good agreement has been found. While it is satisfying that the current framework describes matter and its interactions so well, it is known from cosmology that there is physics not accounted for within the Standard Model. The discovery of discrepancies between the Standard Model predictions and experiments done at particle colliders would be very exciting, as such results could lead to an understanding of the mysteries that are not explained in the current framework, including why there is as much matter in the universe as there is. A broader impact of this research is that the Lattice QCD ensembles used by the PIs are made publicly available and are used by other researchers studying quark interactions throughout the world. Additionally, knowledge of computational methods and problem solving skills needed to perform research in lattice field theory are useful assets for graduate students, whether they continue in academic research positions or get jobs in the private sector.<br/><br/>Laiho's research focuses on calculations using Lattice QCD that are needed to maximize the impact of high-energy particle physics experiments. This includes lattice calculations of heavy-light and light-light weak matrix elements, quantities where one needs to control the effects of non-perturbative QCD. This work makes use of high performance computing facilities throughout the US, and is used for calculations of Standard Model predictions that are needed for comparisons with experimental observations as part of the search for new physics. Laiho also has an interest in applying lattice methods to the study of quantum gravity to try to determine whether or not a quantum field theory of gravity is renormalizable when formulated nonperturbatively. The Lattice QCD calculations funded by this grant are essential to make best use of the existing and planned experimental facilities including LHCb and Belle II. They can help to uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model, and they provide insight into the workings of the strong nuclear force and quark interactions. The research on gravity might lead to an understanding of how to handle another nontrivial theory using lattice methods in the non-perturbative regime."
0.27085,"A fundamental goal of subatomic physics is the precise determination of the physical properties of subatomic particles. The radius of the proton is one of these properties. The radius can be measured by scattering electrons or muons from protons, or by measuring the energy levels of hydrogen or muonic hydrogen, an atom in which the electron is replaced by a muon. To date, the radius has been measured by scattering of electrons, and by the energy levels of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. The muonic measurements disagree with the electronic measurements, an issue known as ""the proton radius puzzle."" The discrepancy has attracted wide attention, because it may indicate the existence of previously unobserved and unexpected differences between the interactions of muons and electrons.<br/><br/>A dedicated MUon proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE), which will run at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland and directly compare the scattering of muons and electrons from protons, is highly anticipated by experts in the field for its potential to resolve the puzzle. This project will cover the prototyping and development of several crucial components of the MUSE experiment detectors. This project will involve the training of students and young scientists, at the undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and junior faculty levels. The institutions involved in this project have trained large numbers of students of each type, including from minority populations. The training they have received in the process of doing basic research has led to careers in a variety of areas, from medical physics to national security, in addition to continued work in fundamental physics research. The MUSE experiment will broaden the perspective of American students by having them work in an international collaboration at an international laboratory, which will prepare them effectively to become prominent global scientists of the next generation. With the broad interest in the proton radius puzzle, MUSE has the potential to be broadly inspirational beyond the current scientific community.<br/><br/>The experiment uses a mixed beam of electrons, muons, and pions. The measurement requires high precision and small systematic errors. This project will build and test the components of the detector system. These include scintillation fiber detectors to measure the trajectories of incoming particles, Cerenkov detectors for particle identification, GEM detectors for precise positioning, straw tube detectors for measuring the trajectories of scattered particles, and scintillation detectors for particle identification of the scattered particles. In addition, a liquid hydrogen target will be developed. Development and testing of these detectors will demonstrate that the required precision can be obtained."
0.04,"This award supports research on photonuclear reactions with polarized beams and targets to investigate the properties of the nucleon and nucleon resonances with Compton scattering and to study heavy nuclei through photofission. In addition, we play a key role in the production of the HD targets used at Jefferson Lab (JLab).<br/><br/>The HIGS (High Intensity Gamma Source) facility at Duke University is ideal for Compton scattering from both polarized and unpolarized nucleon and nuclear targets. A comprehensive program of Compton scattering is beginning in the fall of 2013 on the proton and neutron, which will extract the electromagnetic polarizabilities with high accuracy. The ongoing program of photofission studies with polarized photons exploits the strong variation of the beam asymmetry in direct neutron production both with beam energy and with target. The proposed measurements provide a database for developing nuclear forensics and expand our understanding of this fundamental nuclear reaction.<br/><br/>The frozen spin HD target (HDIce) will be used in three ""A"" rated experiments at JLab after the facility upgrade. The high purity gas used in all these targets will be purified at JMU. Commercial gas that is 98% HD is distilled at low temperature to separate the remaining H2 and D2 and produce gas for making targets with very long spin relaxation times. Recent upgrades to the distillery permit the production of gas with H2 and D2 impurities much lower than previously obtained leading to higher quality targets for the next round of experiments. Existing gas stores are sufficient to produce the required gas.<br/><br/>Undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of this research and will gain experience in nuclear experiments and detectors, data analysis, and applications of nuclear physics."
0.273044,"This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Rochester Institute of Technology provides eight undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in physics, mathematics, astrophysics, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, environmental science, vision science, nano-technology, materials science, color science, computer vision and graphics, and microelectronic engineering. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have practiced a one-minute ""elevator pitch""; given a formal presentation about their work; and prepared a conference poster and a 4-page letter style paper. The REU site will further support five students to present their work at national conferences after the summer.<br/><br/>This REU site will have a number of broader impacts. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics, particularly deaf or hard of hearing students and American Indian students. Steps have been taken to provide a culturally safe environment for all students. The proposed evaluation of the project seeks to answer a number of questions that will inform this project and others like it."
0.546675,"Gravitational Wave (GW) Astronomy promises to provide a revolutionary new view of the universe that can probe previously unexplorable regions, including the interiors of neutron stars, collisions of black holes, which emit energy at luminosities exceeding the entire visible universe, and even remnants of the big bang. However, the challenges are significant because the GW signals will be hidden in orders of magnitude larger noise. To gain new insight into the dynamics of the universe, GW astronomers need to be able to infer the nature of the sources from the observed signals. However, the physical parameters of these sources can only be extracted from the observed signals if the dependence of the waveform on source parameters is known to high-accuracy. The success of the GW astronomy efforts therefore depends critically on advancements in Numerical Relativity (NR). This award funds the well-established research program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) to model merging black hole binaries in the highly-nonlinear regime, which are among the loudest sources for aLIGO/AdVirgo. We focus on binaries in the technically difficult small-mass-ratio, highly-spinning, and highly-precessing regimes, which requires new developments in code optimization, new gauge conditions (especially gauge conditions adapted for the high-spin regime), non-conformally flat initial data for high spins and linear momentum, as well as hybrid numerical/perturbative techniques that will allow us to model a large range of binaries using relatively few numerical simulations. Our principle goals will be to produce waveforms from these extreme binaries of sufficient accuracy for aLIGO/AdVirgo GW data analysis, and to model the gravitational radiation recoil (as well as remnant mass and spins) from highly-precessing binaries in order to elucidate the distributions of these recoils and how they affect the distribution and growth of supermassive black holes. This research is very timely now that aLIGO is scheduled to come online in 2015. <br/><br/>Our research will directly benefit the aLIGO/AdVirgo project, the NINJA and NRAR projects, and an emerging new field in astrophysics: The search for the observational consequences of merging and recoiling black holes. The research proposed here will complement other ongoing projects of our NR group to include matter and magnetic fields in our vacuum general relativistic code in order to study EM counterparts to compact-object mergers and to model accretion disk dynamics near supermassive black holes. This award will not only enable the PIs to enhance their research program, but it will also be used to greatly enhance the research effort at RIT as a whole. The award supports graduate student research in RIT's PhD Astronomy program and a proposed new PhD program in 'Modeling and Computation'. Importantly, our research will be the focus of our new partnership with RIT's National Technical Institute for the Deaf on an NSF-funded project that combines innovative dance and theater performances to promote science to the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Visualizations will also be a vehicle for public outreach events on science, mathematics, and computing through site visits and annual community-wide public exhibits like 'ImagineRIT'."
0.18,"Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform information-processing tasks. This project is focused on a set of questions that lie at the intersection of QIS and the science of making high-precision measurements. This intersection of QIS and measurement science is now called quantum metrology. The specific questions to be investigated include how best to deploy physical systems, such as atoms and photons and tiny engineered resonators, to make the best possible measurements of such physical quantities as electric and magnetic fields and gravitational fields and how to use the strange property of quantum entanglement associated with interacting systems to improve such measurements.<br/><br/>PhD students associated with this project will work within the framework of the Center for Quantum Information and Control at the University of New Mexico, which has a proven track record of training PhD students for careers in QIS. CQuIC students take a sequence of elective courses on QIS topics, are exposed to the interdisciplinary ideas of QIS through a high-level, weekly seminar series and through the weekly CQuIC group meeting, at which papers posted to the e-print server arXiv.org are reviewed and discussed and at which students and postdocs receive intensive training in the art of giving technical talks. CQuIC provides students the opportunity to participate in research collaborations with six external partnering institutions."
4.51,"This award provides three-year continued support for the experimental particle physics and astroparticle physics programs at Michigan State University. The intellectual merit deals with the completion of the final chapter of the 1967 Standard Model and its necessary evolution through physics studies at D0 and CDF at the Tevatron at Fermilab, ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the NuMI Off-axis neutrino Appearance (NOvA) experiment at Fermilab and Ash River, MN, and the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) experiment at the Gamma Ray Observatory at the Sierra Negra in Mexico. The primary research focus is new experiments: ATLAS, HAWC, and NOvA with a selective physics program at D0 and CDF to the completion of the Tevatron program. The broader impacts of this work include the opportunity to bring these front-line research questions into classrooms and to the public at large through lectures and interactive video presentations. In addition, the group engages more than a dozen graduate students and a number of undergraduates into the labs at MSU, Fermilab, and CERN providing unique experiences for students who are often not physics majors."
0.228,"The nature of high performance computing is undergoing rapid change with the advent of general purpose GPU-accelerated architectures. These changes open new opportunities for scientific discovery at a much reduced capital and energy cost, but to exploit them, new algorithms and methods are required. <br/><br/>This project supports the collaborative development and implementation of GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) codes and innovative algorithms for the numerical simulation of the strong interactions of quarks and gluons, namely quantum chromodynamics (QCD), on a lattice. Specifically, this project supports the development of CUDA (parallel coding model from NVIDIA)-based code modules and OpenMP threading that can be used with the MILC [Multiple Instruction (and Multiple Data) Lattice Calculation] code. This 200,000-line code suite is used by several research groups around the world and supports some 100 million core-hours of computing at NSF and DOE national centers and laboratories mostly on conventional supercomputers. Our code development will allow improved performance on GPU clusters and on computers such as Blue Waters at NCSA that contain both GPUs and conventional multicore processors. Performance models developed will guide the performance tuning and help to plan future calculations and should also be of value in studing the effectiveness of exascale architectures. <br/><br/>Interpretation of many of the experimental results in particle physics is currently limited by lack of theoretical understanding. This reduces our ability to determine parameters of the Standard Model and to find evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model through precision experiments. The calculations that are enabled are thus important for the interpretation of many experiments in elementary particle physics. Some of these experiments at Fermilab, Cornell, and at SLAC have been completed. Others such as in Beijing, Geneva, and Japan are still running. <br/><br/>We have publicized previous work on code development and performance modeling by presentations at appropriate conference and publication. We will continue to do so for the current work in order that others can benefit from our methodology and innovations. The MILC code is widely used in benchmarking by several high-performance computing centers. This in turn has led to several vendors contacting us regarding performance of our code on their current and future chips. Thus, having GPU-accelerated code available in MILC could help in the evaluation of or co-design of future high-performance computing architectures. <br/><br/>Finally this project will contribute to the professional education and training of future scientists via the participation of postdoctoral reseachers."
0.42,"In this project, the PI will focus on elucidating two important aspects of RNP liquids: 1) Their assembly from soluble components, and 2) Their material properties, which strongly impact their biological function. The PI will study the complexity of living cells by first taking a bottom-up approach, utilizing an in vitro system of purified components. This will be complemented by utilizing advanced microscopy and image analysis techniques, and novel molecular dynamics measurements. These combined in vitro/in vivo studies will allow the PI to understand the full complexity of RNP liquids, and test the hypothesis that the assembly and properties of these droplets are tuned by ATP-dependent biological activity. The broader impacts of this proposal include educating the next generation of biophysicists by providing laboratory research training at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels; at the undergraduate level, laboratory training for senior thesis research will play a key role. In the classroom, the PI will develop new courses on Quantitative Biology and Soft Living Matter. This teaching is part of the PI's broader effort to build the infrastructure for growing Princeton's nascent Bioengineering community, and couple it to the greater Biophysics community on campus and beyond. At the K-12 level, the PI has developed an outreach partnership with the Trenton public schools, which focuses on inspiring under-represented groups of 8th grade students from Kilmer Elementary School. The PI will visit the classroom for hands-on presentations on Soft Living Matter, and these students will visit the PI's laboratory. To evaluate the efficacy of this outreach, quantitative evaluation tools based on the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA) will be used, which the PI will implement and analyze together with a science education researcher.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.556914,"Project: This is a project to create a POLS-SAVI node at the University of Maryland (UMD). This node, which was conceived during the early stages of the newly created Student Research Network and is vastly expanded under Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) initiative, will also bring in two leading institutions. One is the Technical University of Munich (TUM), which is one of the leading centers in Biophysics in Germany. The other is the National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in India, which enjoys a preeminent stature in the biophysics in the country. These three institutions will add greatly to the POLS-SAVI network both in scientific expertise as well as in the educational aspects. The faculty in the three institutions who will join the POLS-SAVI network bring to bear expertise in a number of areas in biological physics. Among the faculty there is considerable expertise in the basics of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which are becoming increasingly important in tackling problems in single molecule force spectroscopy, a tool that is being used to discover the role of mechanical forces in biology. Methods in these areas are key in understanding fluctuation effects in finite systems including various metabolic and gene networks. On the experimental side both in TUM and UMD a variety of problems probing the response of forces from single molecule to cellular level are being performed using a variety of techniques. Research is also being carried out to understand interactions between proteins and how such interactions are involved in signaling networks. The three universities also focus on functions of molecular machines, mechanics of cytoskeletal networks, the role of membranes in biological functions, and gene networks. Thus, from a scientific perspective UMD, TUM, and NCBS are involved in researches covering the gamut of temporal and length scales. These topics add to and enhance the scope of issues that are being covered by other participating institutions. All three institutions are also deeply involved in educating students in this new emerging area. The collective experience gathered in the three continents will also be useful as the institutions in the network prepare to develop new curriculum. The major scientific benefit of leveraging the entire resources of the network will enable the participants to vastly expand their ability to conduct research by learning from the expertise available in the network rather than be limited by the tools available in one's home institution. In addition, the proposed video conferencing throughout the year between the students and the annual meeting in different venues add to invaluable educational experience in enhancing the scope of training in the POLS. Third, the international scope of the proposed network will have a world-wide impact on the scientific aspect by fostering many potentially powerful collaborations. The three institutions will aid in achieving the basic mission of the POLS-SAVI network, which in turn will have substantial impact on the development, use and application of quantitative methods in biological problems. <br/><br/>This project is being supported jointly by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and by the Molecular Biophysics Program in Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.300175,"The space between organels in a living cell called cytosol is a medium crowded with molecules. It is estimated that 30% of its volume is taken up by macromolecules, proteins and nucleic acids. While a small subset of these molecules can be interacting biochemically with a particular enzyme, the vast majority is chemically inert and is just occupying volume around the enzyme. The consequences of crowding are that more compact structures are favored in crowded media since they free up volume for the crowding molecules to occupy, thus increasing the overall entropy of the system. While this qualitative picture is simple and has borne out in some experiments, a more quantitative understanding of the consequences of crowding on protein function remains scanty, and more so in relation to molecular machines. This project will bring better quantitative understanding of crowding in cells using an experimental system that is amenable to precision measurements and manipulation of molecular motors. Recent studies have linked the down regulation of motor activity to various diseases. The rationale for the proposed studies is that the identification of the mechanisms by which multiple motors and motor co-factors cooperate to haul cargoes in the complex environment of the cell will lead to a fundamental framework for eventual understanding of how failure of these mechanisms is linked to disease. With the latter in mind, the impact of the project will in part be achieved by taking part in training a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students who are proficient in working in the interdisciplinary environment of the proposed activity and who will advance the field as they proceed in their careers. The principal investigator has, and will continue to disseminate the findings of his research program among the general public through high school student internships in his laboratory and through lectures to the students, their parents and their teachers in area high schools. <br/><br/>The PI will use two such machines, the molecular motor proteins kinein-1 and cytoplasmic dynein, to investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding on the function of these enzymes. Motor proteins bind and shuttle cargo inside the cell by stepping along the cytoskeletal filaments. The motors choreographed mechano-chemical cycle has been well characterized in dilute buffer over the past three decades. A single step of a motor involves multiple events of ligand-substrate binding and conformational changes all of which can be modulated by crowders. Indeed, preliminary findings in the PI's lab show that kinesin motility is altered in the presence of crowders. The aims of the proposed work seek to determine the details of this altered function by probing and manipulating motors down to the single molecule level, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the consequences of the altered function of motors on emergent properties of multiple motors hauling cargo within the cell will be established. This work will also address the need to quantify crowding within the heterogeneous cellular makeup. To that end the PI will develop and calibrate a molecular sensor that can report on the local crowding state within the cell. The function of motors will be studied in their native environment as a function of crowding. A crowding sensor is a general tool that will be a crucial leap towards quantitative understanding of the role crowding plays in biological processes."

Gravitational waves are very small, so searching for them presents great challenges in data analysis, mathematical techniques, and computation on top of the technical challenges of building and operating the instruments. A theoretical understanding of the sources of gravitational waves, such as neutron stars and black holes, can also help guide searches as well as learn about these objects from the results of the searches. Both the data analysis and theory work under this award will help transform LIGO from a prototype instrument into a tool for exploring physics and astrophysics, including the possibility of exotic particle phases and the complicated microphysics of matter under the most extreme conditions. A continuous wave signal in particular will give a direct view into the otherwise inaccessible interiors of neutron stars. As they spin down over the years, these stars can tell us about the properties of matter under the most extreme conditions since the Big Bang: supernuclear densities, relativistic speeds, superconducting and superfluid at a hundred million degrees.<br/><br/>This award supports the implementation of matched filtering searches of Advanced LIGO data for continuous gravitational waves based on the Texas Tech group's code used in Initial LIGO publications; and supports development of that code to improve sensitivity and efficiency, allow more continuous gravitational wave searches, and isolate instrumental artifacts. Specific science goals are (1) directed searches for young non-pulsing neutron stars, (2) narrow-band searches for known pulsars with unusual gravitational-wave frequencies, (3) detector characterization focusing on narrow spectral lines, and (4) theoretical guidance and interpretation of searches for continuous gravitational waves, particularly from neutron-star r-modes."
0.175,"In the early 1980's, Richard Feynman proposed a new way to perform computation that directly involves quantum mechanical effects and differs from conventional digital computers that are classical in nature (having one of two states in each bit). Recently, experimental groups have started to realize these Feynman ideas with trapped ion quantum simulators. These devices mimic the quantum behavior of particles by simulating them in a controlled quantum-mechanical arena. The work in this grant focuses on determining how to carry out the next generation of these experiments. They are controlled by shining lasers onto the ions that are in the trap which apply forces onto the ions that depend on the quantum state the ion is in. These forces induce vibrations into the collection of ions, and these vibrations can be detrimental to the functioning of the simulator. This work will determine the effects of these vibrations on the computation and will develop methods to both understand and to control those effects. Work will be carried out in close collaboration with two experimental groups who are building these simulators.<br/><br/>One graduate student will be trained during the period of this grant. The training will help develop the technologically savvy workforce. In addition, a number of classroom visits to local schools in the Arlington, VA school district will be undertaken and presentations will be made that cover different phenomena in quantum mechanics (magnetism for elementary school and the two-slit experiment for middle school). The research work will focus on new paradigms for analog quantum simulation which, if successful, could have an impact on developments of novel computing technologies in the future."
0.745026,"Stem cells (SC) have the potential to revolutionize medicine by facilitating the regeneration or replacement of damaged tissues. Crucial for the use of hSC in medicine is control over inter-cell communication, since those pathways are the ones responsible for making patterns and integrating the fate of a cell with its environment. In this project the PI will develop quantitative models of how spatial patterns arise and evolve in populations of stem cells. The predictions of these models will be tested experimentally. The understanding of the spatial patterns formed by stem cells will be used to understand cell-cell communication and how cells interact with their environment that is very important in biology, medicine, and bioengineering.<br/><br/>Recently an assay was developed for differentiating hSC on micropatterned surfaces, that generates the precursors to ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm, etc. tissues in a spatial arrangement that recapitulates the embryo. This assay permits easy time lapse imaging of stem colonies while the cells signal to each other, move, and acquire distinct patterns of gene expression. Cells can be engineered to produce specific signals on demand and then mixed with naive cells and the emergent patterns followed over time. The relevant signals are generally present at too low a level to be observed directly, so a complex modeling procedure is needed to infer them from the response of the receiving cells. Critical for the success of any modeling in this area are succinct representations for the activity of the hundreds of genes that pattern an embryo. Modern mathematics provides the template for such models, and a separate project will test their application to the development of an organ in the nematode C.elegans. Through a collaboration, this project has access to many hSC lines with fluorescent tags on the genes that mediate cell signaling, and Physicists learn how to derive such lines themselves. Image processing systems developed in house are integrated with experiments to ask whether quantitative and predictive models formulated with only a few variables and guided by geometry are feasible. The goal is an algorithm to select among the infinite combinations of signaling molecules, their concentrations, and the time and duration of their application, the most efficient way to derive any desired cell or tissue from pluripotent cells."
0.06,"The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. This award supports the first searches of Advanced LIGO data for gravitational waves from the youngest neutron stars in the galaxy. As they spin down over the years, these stars can tell us about the properties of matter under the most extreme conditions since the Big Bang: supernuclear densities, relativistic speeds, superconducting and superfluid at a hundred million degrees. One day they may also be used to test whether Einstein's general theory of relativity is the correct description of gravity at astrophysical scales.<br/><br/>The bulk of the work involves the upgrade and implementation of a data analysis code pipeline to perform matched filtering searches for continuous gravitational waves from young supernova remnants. Improvements in the code and data will allow more sensitive searches than ever before. This code will also be adapted for the purpose of detector characterization to assist with improving the LIGO interferometers' performance over the course of their first science run, particularly with regard to narrow-band spectral artifacts."

At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimental students learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theory students can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The research is primarily focused on the immediate plasma and atomic physics issues surrounding improving the trapping of antihydrogen, and on the design of a third generation trap optimized for gravitational research. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at Berkeley and at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, Vlasov codes and 3D Particle-In-Cell codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics. This research is co-sponsored by the NSF's Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering."
0.32,"This CAREER grant funds the research of Professor Jure Zupan at the University of Cincinnati.<br/><br/>Professor Zupan will investigate unsolved issues pertaining to dark matter by exploring the possible connections between dark matter and flavor physics. Indeed, both topics contain deep mysteries about which physicists have relatively little information. The Standard Model of particle physics is built around the observation that nature contains three separate generations of quarks and leptons. These generations of particles all appear identical in terms of their charges and interactions, and differ only in their masses. They also mix amongst each other in non-trivial ways. ""Flavor physics"" is a general term that encapsulates the physics of this generational structure. Professor Zupan aims to use ideas from flavor physics in order to understand properties of ""dark matter"" --- i.e., matter which interacts only gravitationally but which is not luminous. For example, it turns out that the flavor symmetries which might explain the observed pattern of masses of the known elementary particles can also have profound implications for the stability of dark matter and its interactions with visible matter. This in turn has implications for dark-matter searches at colliders, potentially leading to novel search signatures. The research proposed by Professor Zupan will focus on the detection of dark matter in direct detection experiments, the indirect astrophysical signatures of dark matter, and signals of dark-matter production at colliders.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Zupan will continue his participation in public outreach activities, such as organization of talks in Science Cafes and other informal venues. He will also act as a mentor in the hands-on particle-physics QuarkNet program which is aimed at high-school educators and students. He will also establish a ""Fun Science and Math Day"" at middle schools in Cincinnati, where research academics would replace math teachers for a day in order to teach math in novel ways. To make the experience more permanent for the students, Professor Zupan will also distribute a series of illustrated one-line comics about everyday questions such as ""Why is sky blue?"" with scientifically sound but simple answers. Such materials will be based on the already-successful outreach materials that he developed previously in Slovenia. Finally, Professor Zupan will also establish a website where questions and answers from the students will be collected and made available to a wider audience."
0.480001,"The intersection of particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology is an exciting and data-driven field, where a combination of imaginative basic theory and observations has revolutionized our understanding of the Universe. The PI's research focuses on several areas where the potential for new fundamental discoveries is particularly high: Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and their sources, new phenomena in particle physics, Galactic and cosmic magnetic fields, and dark matter and its interactions. The highest energy particles in Nature can now be studied in much greater detail and with higher statistics than ever before at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Previous work has shown that Auger data on UHECR atmospheric showers cannot be explained without profound changes to particle physics at an order of magnitude higher energy than the Large Hadron Collider. Observations suggest that a new - chiral - phase of matter may be created. <br/><br/>With this award, the uniqueness of this possibility and its ramifications for theoretical particle physics will be explored. In order to unravel the seeming contradictions in present interpretations of the data, the PI and her group will use a combination of astrophysics analyses to constrain the sources and possible composition of UHECRs and UHE particle physics phenomenology. Other topics of research include identifying possible sources of UHECRs and modeling the Galactic magnetic field, as well as fundamental topics in particle theory, astrophysical constraints on dark matter interactions, plus non-standard supersymmetry signatures and other phenomenology for the Large Hadron Collider.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts include public lectures about the PI's research and about the New York Schools Cosmic Particle Telescope (NYSCPT) project; mentoring high school students, teacher and student participants of NYSCPT, women (and men) graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral researchers, junior faculty; and founding participant of the NYU ""WINS"" program to foster undergraduate women's participation in science and the Collegiate Honors Seminar program, and President of the NYU Women's Faculty Caucus."
0.08,"This CAREER award funds the research activities of Professor Joshua Ruderman at New York University.<br/><br/>Significant evidence suggests that most of the matter in our Universe is composed of an unknown source known as ""dark matter"". Experiments conducted over the next few years will make dramatic progress testing the extent to which dark matter is a particle that interacts with ordinary matter. Meanwhile, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is exploring the highest energies ever probed. The LHC recently discovered a remarkable new particle, the Higgs boson, and is now studying the properties of this new particle. The LHC may also discover additional new particles as well. Against this backdrop, Professor Ruderman will pursue an original program of research and education concentrating on the origins of dark matter and the Higgs. He will study the exciting possibility that there exist new hidden sectors of particles which have thus far escaped experimental detection because they are very weakly interacting with ordinary particles. He will explore new models in which dark matter is a hidden-sector particle, or in which the Higgs boson interacts with hidden-sector particles. In order to help in spreading physics to a broad audience, Professor Ruderman will also establish a competitive ""Physics in Media Travel Award"". He will partner with NYU's Tisch School of the Arts to send film students to visit physics experiments that will appear in their movies. He will also partner with NYU's Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program (SHERP) to send science journalism students to visit physics experiments which will be featured in their stories. Resulting films will be screened at local high schools, and resulting stories will be disseminated online in various journalism venues.<br/><br/>More specifically, Professor Ruderman will explore novel cosmologies for hidden-sector dark matter in which the annihilation rate is exponentially suppressed, predicting dark matter exponentially lighter than the TeV scale. This exponential suppression occurs when dark matter annihilates into heavier states, or is in equilibrium with heavier particles that are annihilating. Professor Ruderman will develop new observational tests for light dark matter, including searches for UV and soft X-ray photons emitted by dark-matter decays or annihilations. Professor Ruderman will also explore the interplay of hidden sectors with Higgs physics. He will develop novel models with a fine-tuned Higgs mass and light hidden-sector scalars that interact with the Higgs. He will also explore supersymmetric models with a natural Higgs mass in which stops are light and abundantly produced at the LHC but nevertheless hidden behind top-quark backgrounds."
0.81318,"This award will support a group of four highly experienced PI's to work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, the European particle physics laboratory. The LHC machine and ATLAS detector were built using funds from the NSF and from other agencies around the world. It proved its worth three years ago when scientists discovered the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the known matter in the universe. In spite of its success, the Standard Model still leaves a number of questions about the fundamental structure of the universe unanswered, giving rise to research exploring Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This award will allow the PI's to continue their leading role in studies of the Higgs width and couplings, properties that have so far established it as the SM object anticipated. It will also support their continuing search for BSM that could materialize at the higher energy experiments that are currently underway. <br/><br/>The group supports a vigorous broader impact program. The centerpiece of this is a large, modular, multi-panel exhibit of ATLAS and the LHC. This has been used at major science festivals in NYC and Washington DC, and will be sent to other festivals around the country. They also plan to continue their leadership role in the ATLAS Zooniverse project, which allows the public to view and analyze ATLAS events. <br/><br/>This project will be leveraged by the group's expertise in the operations of the ATLAS trigger, responsible for selection of the interesting reactions that occur in ATLAS. This becomes increasingly key to the physics potential of the LHC in Run2. In this run the LHC will operate at 13 TeV, almost double its currently highest energy of 8 TeV. In addition to conventional approaches to the trigger, and to enhancing sensitivity to new physics, the group will attempt prototyping new strategies such as ""data scouting"" that can fill holes in traditional off-line data analysis pipelines. They will also work on including the transverse momentum trigger, the trigger menu, trigger software, statistical methods and tools, analysis tools, pileup simulation techniques, and event visualization tools. They also plan detailed study of silicon detector properties using the infrastructure they have developed for the ATLAS upgrade."
0.617629,"Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the Universe and yet we do not know many of their properties. For example, we do not know their absolute mass scale or their particle-antiparticle nature. Because of their abundance, even a small mass could have far-reaching consequences for understanding their role in the evolution of our Universe. Knowing if neutrinos are their own antiparticles could have implications in understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry of our Universe.<br/><br/>Neutrino-less double beta decay (NLDBD) experiments address these two fundamental questions. Double beta decay is a rare nuclear decay that has been measured in several nuclei when it is energetically favorable. Some nuclei are stable against ordinary beta decay but are unstable for double beta decay in which two neutrons in the nucleus are simultaneously converted to protons and two electrons are emitted. Double beta decay can proceed through several modes. The experimentally measured process, the two-neutrino mode in which two electron antineutrinos are also emitted, is completely described by known physics. NLDBD is an as-yet-undetected decay that involves no neutrinos in the final state and necessarily would indicate that neutrinos are their own antiparticle. The rate of such decays determines the scale for the effective neutrino mass.<br/><br/>The CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) experiment at the Gran Sasso laboratory (LNGS), Assergi, Italy, is one of the next generation experiments to search for NLDBD. It uses the 130-Te isotope with a design sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass ranging between 40-70 meV, depending on nuclear structure calculations. The UCLA group's major hardware responsibilities include the testing of all the front-end electronics and the installation and commissioning of the electronics system at LNGS in collaboration with the Milan and South Carolina groups. Their analysis focus will be on understanding of the residual background sources through Monte Carlo simulations.<br/><br/>The technology being used in CUORE which is based on milliKelvin bolometry is one of the most innovative and largest scale in the field. If their electronics proves out as designed, it will likely influence other fields. The NLDBD experiments address fundamental physics issues that have a scientific impact beyond particle and nuclear physics. For example, if neutrinos are Majorana particles and neutrino masses are from the See-Saw Mechanism, the lepton sector could violate CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry and contribute to the matter and anti-matter asymmetry of the Universe. The group will also help train undergraduate and NSF-REU students in their research programs and provide them with research experiences in neutrino physics and modern detector technology."
0.24,"The main aim of this project is to complete the formulation of effective descriptions of quantum systems in canonical language. Especially the field of canonical quantum gravity (including loop quantum gravity) requires a more general setting than standard effective actions, allowing for instance for an enlarged gauge structure, general covariance and the associated freedom to change the time variable, and a non-Gaussian or non-vacuum state as expansion basis. Compared to existing formulations, the major extension provided by work in the project will lead to a canonical version of effective quantum field theory. Applications will include an analysis of renormalization in canonical quantum gravity, comparisons with existing results in effective quantum gravity to check the low-energy limit of loop quantum gravity, as well as structure formation in the early universe and possible restrictions on initial states.<br/><br/>Quantum gravity is expected to be important at high energy density, for instance in the early universe during or just after the big-bang. In such regimes, space-time itself, and not just matter in space-time, is described by a wave function subject to quantum uncertainty and fluctuations. For several conceptual and technical reasons, it is difficult to evaluate such wave functions for potential physical observations, but as in particle physics, their implications can often be approximated and derived using effective equations. Standard methods of particle physics are not directly applicable to quantum gravity, in which the classical structure of space-time is no longer available. This project aims to complete the setting of effective equations suitable for quantum gravity, a process in which several questions of mathematical interest (such as Poisson geometry and algebraic structures) will be touched as well. It will contribute to physical cosmology by providing new scenarios and equations for structure formation in the early universe that include quantum-gravity effects."
0.4,"Experimental studies of proton collisions at the LHC are likely to reveal the answers to some of the most fundamental questions in physics. Already, experiments like Fermi GST and PAMELA are producing very exciting - though puzzling - results that may be major hints to an unexpectedly rich dark matter sector. There are many possibilities for dramatic discoveries, which will usher in a new era for dark matter and fundamental particle physics. How one combines the complementary information from these disparate measurements into a cohesive picture is not readily apparent. Initially, it is unlikely that an obvious picture will emerge that is more compelling than conventional explanations, such as poorly understood modeling or experimental systematics. Thus, one must be prepared to pose serious questions about the data, the theoretical interpretation, the experimental systematics, and additional modeling assumptions that are not limited by avoidable technical limitations. This award supports a program of physics research built around a unifying approach to large-scale scientific data analysis, initially dealing with data from LHC experiments, in a way that is scalable with respect to complexity of data, experimental apparatuses, and theoretical models. The approach could have profound impact on early standard model physics measurements and the extension to Higgs physics and beyond as well as facilitate communication and cooperation between ATLAS and CMS, between theorists and experimentalists, and among researchers from different disciplines. <br/>In terms of broader impact the key development in this award that enables the scalable approach to large-scale data analysis is applicable beyond the field of particle physics. Experiments as diverse as Fermi GST, HESS, and the IceCube neutrino telescope are already exploring the use of this technology, which is a concrete indication of the broader impacts of the proposed research. Additional impacts follow from a well-integrated educational and outreach component. A portable and professionally-designed exhibit will be constructed for use at the popular New York City World Science Festival street fair, area science fairs, career fairs, and the like. The booth will utilize existing material from the ATLAS outreach group. Additionally, the exhibit will be the basis for a project integrated into a teaching methods course in the Department of Teaching and Learning at NYU. The project will be to design activities for the exhibit itself and to develop and assess physics teaching methods. Thus, the exhibit, the activities, and the assessment of the exhibit will be the culmination of a semester-long project, and those teachers can bring the developed activities to their own schools. Finally, the PI will mentor high-school students from the Harlem Children's Society so that they can understand and operate the demonstrations, thus serving as peer-group liaisons, and role models for under-represented groups in the sciences."
5.668001,"This award supports the continuation of QuarkNet, a program which provides valuable research experience to teachers enabling them to teach the basic concepts of introductory physics in a context that students find exciting. QuarkNet has created an ongoing national community of researchers that include high school teachers and students as well as physicists. QuarkNet's goals are to maintain and enhance this community, to attract young students to careers in science and technology, to help develop scientific literacy in society, and to develop links between the high school classroom and experiments and techniques used to explore the scientific frontier. Key features of QuarkNet are the establishment of mentor relationships between teachers and scientists, summer research experiences of up to eight weeks for teachers and students, and the development of a scientific and learning community within and among centers. QuarkNet provides opportunities for teachers to become more professional, resulting in the development of programming for peers in the center, in their schools and districts and beyond. QuarkNet provides a centrally hosted, scalable, parallel cyberlearning environment as a cloud-like service.

0.45,"Plasmas constitute over 99% of the visible universe and turbulent mixing of plasmas is a fundamental process that is important both in natural and artificial situations. Turbulent mixing of ionized gas, called plasma, is especially fascinating when the plasma is embedded inside a strong magnetic force field. Mixing of magnetized plasma has special geometric relationships, couples energy from small and large sized vortex-like structures know as ""eddies,"" and creates self-organization through a remarkable turbulent ""pinch."" A collaboration between two universities will operate two unique facilities, called laboratory magnetospheres, that contain high-temperature ionized gas using a magnetic force field that resembles the field that surround our Earth and other planets. New measurements will be combined with new theories and simulations that will answer unresolved questions including: How do plasma eddies couple energy at different sizes? How do plasmas evolve during turbulent mixing? What mechanisms cause turbulent self-organization? New science will advance including: (1) global imaging and control of turbulent interchange mixing in a variety of plasma conditions, (2) study of electrostatic self-organization through the understanding of the turbulent pinch, and (3) validating our models for lowfrequency turbulence by carrying out self-consistent nonlinear simulations of turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres.<br/><br/>This research has broad impact because turbulent mixing of magnetized plasma is ubiquitous and fundamental. Understanding turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres will improve our understanding of (1) processes occurring in the ionosphere, which is important to satellite communication, (2) turbulence inside the central regions of planetary magnetospheres, which is important to space weather models, and (3) the anisotropic mixing of low-dimensional fluid systems, which is important to industrial processes. Additionally, this collaborative research uses state-of-the-art facilities at highly-regarded research universities to motivate students and scientists to explore plasma dynamics in a magnetic configuration that resembles a magnetosphere and to encourage the next generation of scientists able to understand and control high-temperature, ionized matter."
0.2,"Quarks are elementary particles that are strongly bound inside protons and neutrons. The residual strong interactions between protons and neutrons give rise to all of nuclear physics, from the simplest nuclear reactions responsible for fusion, to the intricate structure of large unstable nuclei. In essence, nuclei are to the strong 'chromodynamic' force what molecules are to the electromagnetic force. Tremendous progress is being made by solving the theory of strong interactions numerically. Current computing power and algorithms have put one within reach of realistic computations. Quantitative knowledge of the strong force will ultimately render nucleons and nuclei into laboratories for investigating fundamental symmetries and probing the limits of the Standard Model of particle physics. The comprehensive research program of the PI will combine advances in theoretical physics and high-performance computing to help advance our knowledge about nucleons and nuclei to the most advanced level yet. Moreover, the scope of this program affords both student and post-doctoral researchers considerable opportunities for training in nuclear and computational science, two areas in which an advanced technical workforce is much needed.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to study electromagnetic and parity-violating properties of strongly bound systems directly from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The distribution of charge and magnetism within nucleons will be explored by calculating their magnetic moments and electromagnetic polarizabilities using lattice gauge theory. Effort will also be geared toward studying the electromagnetic structure of light nuclei and hyper-nuclei using lattice QCD techniques, including the challenge of reducing the quark mass. Manifestations of the weak interaction at low energies will additionally be investigated from QCD. The parity-violating component of non-leptonic weak interactions introduces hadronic parity violation, and probes quark-quark correlations deep within hadrons. Due to feasibility of lattice QCD computations in the isotensor channel, lattice renormalization of isotensor parity violation will be determined and electromagnetic mixing will be addressed for the first time. Novel methods will be sought for future lattice calculations in the remaining isospin channels."
0.16,"Self-organization occurs in many complex living and non-living systems. It is a great challenge to understand the basic principles of self-organization in these systems and to distinguish phenomena in living systems that is shared with non-living systems from phenomena that is generic only to living systems. The PIs in this project will compare self-organization in granular and soft matter systems to self-organization in a yeast cell population. Both systems seem to share common principles of self-organization and the PIs will uncover the basic principles of self-organization of yeast by comparing to the detailed knowledge that exists of self-organization in granular materials. The PIs will engage students to participate in computer simulations and train them in dynamical systems theory and its diverse applications.<br/><br/>In particular the PIs will study population dynamics combining experiments, computations and theory. On the experimental side, the program is focused on three important aspects: First, the PIs will measure the response of populations to genome rewiring. Genome-rewiring is a perturbation exposing the complex cellular dynamics beyond the specific fast relaxing responses observed under more standard perturbations. Second, the PIs will measure the dynamics under controlled conditions, at high temporal resolution over many cell generations covering the wide dynamic range characterizing gene interactions and other intracellular processes as well as population processes such as adaptation. Third, the PIs will study the dynamic coupling between the population and the environment. Their computational efforts will concentrate on constructing a unique framework for population dynamics based on cellular random organization, connecting the intracellular complex dynamics with population processes."

Studying the larva's simplified olfactory system will advance understanding of the basic principles of human sense of smell. Insects are mportant disease vectors and agricultural pests who rely extensively on smells to locate food, hosts, and mates, so this work will have important applications in pest control. Undergraduates and high school students, especially from underrepresented groups, will be actively involved in the research. An additional component of this project is outreach to local elementary students, especially the creation of a program to engage students in tinkering and construction. <br/><br/>How do brains make decisions based on noisy and often conflicting sensory input? Why does the same input elicit variable behaviors, even in the simplest organisms? This project aims to use the fruit fly larva's sense of smell as a model to explore these questions by studying the olfactory system of the Drosophila larva. A given odor stimulates or inhibits a set of odor receptor neurons, yet on the basis of this pattern of stimulation, organisms from flies to humans recognize and classify odors rapidly and reliably. The PI will image the responses of odorant receptor neurons in the larva's dorsal organ (its ""nose"") to understand how olfactory information is first presented to the brain, taking advantage of the genetic tools available in Drosophila, the larva's transparency, and custom built apparatus developed in the PI's lab. A second goal of this project is to develop the technology necessary to take full advantage of the larva as a model for decoding the neural circuitry of olfaction. To move towards or away from an odor, the larva uses sensory input to drive motor output. In this process, it modulates a number of behaviors, e.g. moving forward, stopping, and sweeping the head to one side or the other. The rules by which the larva changes its motor output in response to sensory input in order to move towards a goal represent a navigational strategy. Using light activated ion channels the PI will evoke activity directly in the sensory neurons in order to measure the computations involved in transforming temporal variations in sensory input into directed motor output. The promise of the larva, a small crawling animal with a transparent skin, is that the neural activity in freely behaving animals can be visualized. In practice, we do not have a microscope capable of keeping up with a moving animal. The project will develop a microscope that can track individual neurons in a moving larva making possible to ""read the larva's mind"" as it goes about its business, allowing us to link together sensory input, neural activity, and evoked behavior in order to understand the function of neural circuits. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrated Orgamismal System, and the Emerging Frontiers program in the Biological Sciences Directorate."
0.18,"Collisions of neutron stars and black holes are very rare events, but the enormous energies they release in gravitational waves, infrared radiation, X-rays, and gamma-rays make them potentially detectable even when very far away. Their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals contain information about the properties and unknown physics of the colliding objects, but to extract this information, astronomers need theoretical models to which they can compare. For this project, computer simulations will be carried out of systems with a black hole and neutron star orbiting each other and eventually merging. Simulations will also explore the debris commonly produced by black hole-neutron star and neutron star-neutron star mergers: radioactive gas ejected into the surrounding space and hot, magnetized nuclear matter swirling around a black hole. Carrying out these simulations will involve training both graduate and undergraduate students on techniques of computer modeling in relativistic astrophysics. The resulting gravitational wave and nuclear debris data will be made available to all astronomers working to detect and characterize these events. <br/><br/>This research fills some of the most interesting remaining gaps in the modeling of inspiral, disk, and outflow phases of black hole-neutron star binary mergers using simulations with the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), a high-accuracy numerical relativity code that now includes magnetohydrodynamics, nuclear microphysics, and neutrino cooling. Simulations of long inspirals are used to test and improve algorithms for detecting and identifying the gravitational wave signals from such sources. Improvements to SpEC's treatment of flows near black hole horizons enable higher-accuracy accretion disk simulations, and these are used to study the disk dynamics, gamma ray burst, energy extraction, and late-time (tenths of a second) behavior. The project studies outflows for a wide range of binary parameters. The evolution of ejecta far from the post-merger black hole is tracked with smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and nuclear reaction network codes using SpEC data as input, enabling predictions of fallback, kilonova brightness, and nucleosynthesis."
0.16,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Sergey Dubovskiy at the New York University. <br/><br/>Effective field theory has proven to be an extremely successful and powerful framework for describing a wide range of phenomena from particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider to the growth of density perturbations in cosmic fluids. However, it is challenged by two dramatic breakdowns of dimensional analysis---the incredible smallness of the vacuum energy and of the Higgs mass, compared to the characteristic scale of gravity. With the hope of helping to resolve these puzzles, Professor Dubovskiy aims to enrich the effective field theory toolbox with new sophisticated techniques and to come up with and test new radical theoretical ideas beyond the traditional framework. At the same time he will be looking for new observational probes, which may provide new hints on the origin of the Higgs mass and the vacuum energy. The research of Professor Dubovskiy will cover a broad spectrum of physical phenomena, ranging from the superradiant instability of astrophysical black holes as a tool to discover new particles to the dynamics of flux tubes, responsible for the confinement of quarks. <br/><br/>The research that will be funded covers not only a wide range of topics in high energy theory and cosmology, but has an impact throughout the Physics Division. For example, studies of the vacuum structure of string theory has led Prof. Dubovskiy to propose a new type of particle related to the axion, which would constitute the dark matter. Studying the interactions of this dark matter with black holes has led to extraordinary experimental signatures, ranging from astrophysical studies of black hole masses to specific gravitational wave signatures that are in the range accessible to the Advanced Large Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). These will be studied in detail. There are also substantial interrelations with atomic physics and with nuclear physics. One of the other projects will contribute to understanding the dynamics of flux tubes, which hold quarks together in the nucleon.<br/><br/>The award will also fund community outreach activities. Professor Dubovskiy will contribute to the development of the NYU Science Communication Workshop program, which helps train a generation of scientists in effective communication with the public, and the award will support numerous scientists. He also will give presentations on particle physics and cosmology at a local high school. In addition, the research project relies on the active involvement of graduate students and postdocs, thereby bringing junior physicists to the frontiers of fundamental physics research."

0.113466,"Animals move with remarkable stability and agility through nearly every environment. To do so, they rely on interacting neural and mechanical systems that must operate in the context of the physics of sensing, actuation, and environmental interactions. Modern data acquisition tools provide unprecedented access to the underlying neural, muscular, and mechanical signals that implement control. However, these signals alone are not a framework for understanding how sensory information transforms into motor outputs. This CAREER project leverages several emerging experimental and analytical techniques to show how locomotor dynamics emerge from this sensorimotor transform. This framework for extracting principles of sensorimotor control is based on combining high-resolution neuromuscular recordings, information theoretic and dimensionality-reduction data analytics, and the formal language of system identification and control theory. The experimental framework of this proposal is transferrable to other living and engineered systems composed of many subsystems connected by feedback such as gene or protein networks, cell mechanics, or population dynamics. Principles of locomotor control that emerge from this work will synergize with the BRAIN initiative and similar programs by providing context through which to interpret a deep, detailed understanding of brain structure, anatomy, and connectivity. They will also address challenges in the new era of robotics and neural engineering. There is a pressing need for neuro-technologies that enable versatile movement while embodied in physical systems. More broadly this work will enable translation of research-based undergraduate learning into scientific and education products. It will bring a neuroscience component to the growing Physics of Living Systems curriculum at Georgia Tech. Within the VIP program, students will receive training at the interface of biology, physics, and engineering by engaging in research-based learning that is organized into a vertical mentoring system. Ultimately the study of how brain and body control movement is an accessible context in which to engage the public and further converge education of physics and biology even outside the walls of the research university.<br/><br/>The research uses three experimental platforms (two animals and one robot). They provide insights into the shared neural and mechanical processing challenges animals face despite using different modes of locomotion. The research program includes recording and altering a nearly complete motor program (the set of all neuromuscular commands to appendages) with spike-level resolution while an animal behaves in a virtual reality environment. The PI's work also explores the performance consequences of different control architectures and the sensorimotor determinants on maneuverability. The program will use the interdisciplinary study of movement to create a scientific foundry for the Physics of Living Systems at Georgia Tech with an emphasis on how physics approaches provide a context for understanding neural signals. The core of the foundry will be a vertically integrated research team of undergraduates that will complete the loop of research-based education to classroom-inspired research. To transfer the impact outside the university, the researchers will team with local high school teachers to innovate new education tools based on the accessibility of high-speed imaging, surface electromyography, and the study of movement."
0.06,"The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. This award supports research that helps aLIGO to achieve design sensitivity in the coming years by contributing to a more complete accounting of sources of noise and characterization of the detectors. This will eventually lead to the publishing of GW data to the public with robust data quality flags. Supporting scientific discoveries by empowering the community at large is a primary goal of this project. Additionally, the researchers will continue to engage the faculty of the WSU campuses in Pullman and Tri-Cities to teach undergraduate students about GW science both through lectures and lab exercises. The latter campus caters to a large percentage of Hispanic and Native-American populations, both of which are under-represented, and offers a rare setting for integrating university education with cutting-edge research in gravitation being carried out at a nearby lab.<br/><br/>The aLIGO detectors are being commissioned as we speak. These broadband detectors will also target the detection of GWs from multiple sources, such as binary black holes, spinning non-axisymmetric neutron stars, core collapse supernovae, and stochastic GW background of astrophysical or cosmological origins. They will accomplish this by resolving changes in the 4-km separations of its interferometric test mass optics that are a billionth the size of an atom. The WSU team will integrate the multiple new sensors that have been installed in aLIGO into the model of the interferometer noise budget and work on reducing any gap between its prediction and the observed noise floor."
0.07,"Gravitational waves (GWs), distortions of the geometry and space and time predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, provide a new window on the universe, allowing us to supplement the range of information available from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, for example, from optical and radio observations, from data from cosmic rays and from neutrino measurements. Tthe Laser Interferometry Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) has recently been upgraded to its advanced configuration, with an increased sensitivity which should provide the first direct GW detection in the near future. This project will involve faculty and students of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), who will analyze data from LIGO in the quest for that first detection and the resulting groundbreaking expansion of our knowledge of the universe.<br/><br/>In this project, we will analyze LIGO data to look for signals from two types of sources: rapidly rotating neutron stars (extremely dense objects more massive than the Sun and the size of a city, spinning tens to hundreds of times every second), and binary systems of black holes in the last seconds of the breakdown of their orbits due to GW emission. We will carry out a search for GWs from the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1 using a cross-correlation technique which was recently shown in a mock data challenge to be the most sensitive search method currently implemented for this target. We will also refine and implement a method to estimate the parameters of compact binary systems using numerical simulations, furthering the synergy between the numerical relativity and data analysis communities. In addition to the search for GWs, visualizations will be produced of gravitational-wave propagation and detection which will aid the general public's understanding of the science done by LIGO."
0.08,"The detection of gravitational waves on 14 September 2015 was an historic milestone in physics and astronomy. The detection was an important validation for General Relativity in both its confirmation of the existence of gravitational waves and in the accuracy of the predicted waveforms. The event was also a breakthrough in astronomy with the first direct detection of a black hole binary system. The era of gravitational wave astronomy has begun and with it comes increased expectations for more observations at greater sensitivity. The main obstacle to improved sensitivity is thermal noise in LIGO's mirror coatings. LIGO senses gravitational waves using an interferometer, an L-shaped detector with 4 km long arms. Identical light waves are sent from the vertex down orthogonal arms to a mirror. When the reflected beams recombine at the vertex the difference in phase corresponds to the arm length difference that can arise, in part, from gravitational waves. Thus the detection of gravitational waves depends on the precision detection of the surface of the end mirrors. LIGO operates at room temperature or 300 above absolute zero. Therefore the mirrors are relatively hot. That thermal energy is expressed as vibrations at the mirror's resonant frequencies. Those frequencies are much higher than the frequencies at which LIGO is designed to detect gravitational waves. If the mirrors were composed of ideal elastic materials, these vibrations would be ignored and of no concern. Indeed the special glass used for the mirror substrates is a nearly ideal elastic material. However the highly reflective mirror coating applied to the substrate has enough internal friction that it shifts some of the mirror's vibrational energy down to gravitational wave frequencies. That motion masks the gravitational wave signal and is termed mirror coating thermal noise. The goal of this research project is to produce a mirror coating with suffi ciently reduced thermal noise in order to enable a significant increase in LIGO's sensitivity. <br/><br/>This award supports research to reduce coating thermal noise by lowering the dissipation, or mechanical loss, in the coating materials. This dissipation occurs when an oscillation in strain causes a state transition, such as a bond angle rotation, that emits a photon or phonon at de-excitation. This two state model is known as an asymmetric double-well potential. The dissipation is reduced by increasing the energy asymmetry in the states and thus lowering the transition probability. Annealing lowers dissipation by allowing the material to relax into its lowest energy state. It also reduces density fluctuations thereby raising the transition energy. But annealing is limited by low crystallization temperatures. Amorphous coatings are mixtures of high-index metal-oxide dielectrics in which the crystallization temperature is shifted above the effective annealing temperature. Recent advanced in work on amorphous silicon coatings show that the benefits of annealing can be obtained by depositing the coating on a heated substrate. Because the coating surface molecules are less constrained, the substrate temperatures are much less than the bulk annealing temperatures. The group will test this process in amorphous metal-oxide coatings and will investigate whether ion-assisted beam deposition might provide suffi cient energy to the surface layer to effectively anneal the coating without any heating process. Finally, the group will continue work with Stanford's researchers on conductive coatings to combat charging noise."
0.082312,"This award supports the production of a longitudinal video documentary of the evolution of Advanced LIGO and will chronicle the most critical and exciting period in the history of gravitational wave science in the past 100 years. LIGO resumed the search for gravitational waves in 2015 with a newly upgraded detector and on September 14, 2015 detected gravitational waves for the first time, astounding not only the scientific community but the entire world. Using footage captured at critical periods between August 2015 and March 2016 during the discovery phase as well as new filming taking place over the next two years, the team will produce films which will impact at least hundreds of thousands of people and possibly many more than that. The goal is to educate, inspire, and motivate. Students at the high school and undergraduate levels may be more inspired to pursue STEM careers after watching scientific vignettes focusing on the exciting science and technology of Advanced LIGO. Scientific historians and sociologists will have the opportunity to use the hundreds of hours of available film clips as a video database to investigate in detail the discovery of gravitational waves as a case study of large scale collaborations (""Big Science""). Videos highlighting the cutting edge technological advances brought about by Advanced LIGO and their impacts on other fields of science and technology may prove effective for educating officials and policy makers on the benefits of fundamental science.<br/><br/>During the course of the project, a series of professionally made video shorts will be produced for the LIGO Laboratory and LSC for education and public outreach purposes through distribution on LIGO Laboratory, LSC web sites, and the LIGO YouTube Channel. Through an extensive series of film shoots, XPLR Productions will work with the LIGO Laboratory and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) to capture key moments as LIGO scientists work to achieve Advanced LIGO's design sensitivity and carry out a series of observing runs over the next two years. The team will produce a series of video shorts explaining the important scientific and technological concepts and issues of Advanced LIGO by the scientific experts who create them. In the longer term, footage will used to produce either a feature length documentary film or a twelve-part series on television entitled 'LIGO' chronicling the discovery of gravitational waves and the exploration of exotic high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as colliding black holes. Intended for broad distribution through cinema or television, 'LIGO' will bring science to life for a wide audience."
0.099784,"Search for macroscopic forces outside predictions from the Standard Model of cosmology have received particular attention by experimentalists in the last few decades. Understanding the fundamental forces of nature has always been an important part of physics. While the first such force studied was the gravitational force and our understanding of this interaction is extremely precise for relatively large separations among the interacting bodies, its validity at short distances has only recently been tested. Furthermore, the possibility of undetected light bosons, elementary particles governing the interaction between spin polarized bodies, is very poorly constrained. The groups plans to undertake an effort to gain a better understanding of these issues. By combining sample development and very precise measurements of the interactions between a source and a test mass, a much better knowledge of the interaction strength and mass of potential light bosons will be gained. The PI and co-PI will continue to attract undergraduate and high school students in physics and engineering to participate in the proposed work. Graduate students involved in the project will also have supervisory duties over undergraduate students, improving their leadership skills. Both PIs are minority members, and they will recruit students to participate in this research from underrepresented groups in physics. In particular the PI will use his position as co-advisor of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)-IUPUI chapter to interest the Hispanic and Native American community in Science careers. Graduate students will be trained in two sub-disciplines in physics, precision measurements and magnetism. Demonstrations associated with the principles of forces, their actions at a distance and the decrease of their strength as the distance increases will be presented at community gathering events (School of Science Freshmen Picnic Day, Open Houses) and recruiting events and in the classroom environment.<br/><br/>Specifically, this proposal will: i) extend existing constraints for unpolarized masses at submicron range. This will be achieved mainly through a minor modification of the system previously used, ii) develop spin-polarized masses with no net magnetization. This development will be accomplished by the deposition of thin films in the required geometry, (iii) use the grown spin-polarized, zero magnetization films to constrain the existence of monopole-dipole interactions at short ranges, and (iv) study the systematic effect of the residual electrostatic forces present in the experiment. The ubiquitous problem encountered in the measurement of small forces at short separations arising from the effect of random electric potential on the surfaces of the test and source bodies will continue to be investigated."
0.25,"The Syracuse group will support the search for gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), with special emphasis on the search for signals from binary star systems consisting of black holes and/or neutron stars. The group's research will be aimed at developing better ways to recognize brief intervals of time when LIGO's data is of poor quality or when one of the LIGO interferometers generates a spurious signal. This work will improve the sensitivity of searches for new signals by increasing our confidence that weak signals are real astronomical events, not instrumental artifacts. The group will continue to train students and postdocs who will be tomorrow's leading scientists. The P.I. will also support broader understanding in the community by completing the editing of a book on the technology of gravitational wave interferometers, and by consulting with sociologist Prof. Harry Collins as he completes his study of the history of gravitational wave detection and hands off the project to a new generation of scholars.<br/><br/> In support of LIGO's search for signals from compact binary systems, the group will develop a new technique for distinguishing between genuine black hole binary signals and instrumental transients that mimic signals, improving the sensitivity and reliability of the search. They will improve on tools for associating transients in auxiliary data channels with spurious binary signals in the main gravitational wave channel. The group will also build tools for exploring the LIGO data via audio methods, and will compile a library of standard sound files for comparison with interesting events. They will develop new tools for examining data quality in close to real time, in support of the effort to link gravitational wave signals with electromagnetic observations. By learning better ways to distinguish between genuine gravitational wave signals and instrumental artifacts, the Syracuse group will improve the sensitivity of LIGO's searches and increase the believability of its results. This research will also enable instrument specialists to focus more clearly on instrumental problems that are detrimental to searches for signals, leading to further improved performance."
0.075,"An understanding of nature, and of physical processes, proceeds most fruitfully when there are correlated theoretical predictions and experimental results. This theoretical and computational work builds on experimental advances achieved in the last 15 to 20 years, in exploitation of laser cooling of atoms. An ensemble of bosons, at cold enough temperature, can occupy just the lowest quantum state, producing Bose-Einstein condensation, while two fermions cannot be in the same quantum state. However, in one-dimension, if the density is low enough, both boson and fermion ensembles collide without penetration. As pointed out by M. Girardeau in 1960, in this regime bosons behave like fermions. Predictions and experiments could test theoretical models and thereby extend the understanding of cold atom dynamics in effective one-dimensional confinement. The second part of the proposed work relates to current efforts to develop experimental methods beyond those used for atoms, to simple molecules. The usual experimental approach is to start with cold atoms, induce them to combine in a magnetic field (""Feshbach resonance states""), then excite these loosely bound molecules into higher states of different electronic structure which can then decay into the lowest molecular vibrational-rotational quantum state, with minimal translational energy. This production method requires an accurate knowledge of molecular energy levels so as to know where to tune the lasers. This group's work has been to supply that data to find the optimum pathway for production of cold NaK molecules from cold sodium (Na) and potassium (K) atoms. This work is relevant to a broad range of areas including quantum information science and chemical reactions at ultracold energies.<br/><br/>The group will study one-dimensional ensembles of fermions and bosons in one-dimension in the low density regiem. Recent experiments have tested theoretical models for oscillation frequencies of atomic ensembles in harmonic potentials under various conditions. This theory will be extended by performing calculations for the behavior of atomic ensembles over a range of densities when there is a central potential barrier, giving a ""double-well"" potential. In the cold atom regime when quantum wavefunctions extend so as to penetrate a possible barrier, there can be quantum tunneling through the barrier. But this will depend on the atomic density, which determines the extent to which the atom ensemble resembles either extreme limit of bosons or fermions. Because the intermediate cases present rather complicated situations, predictions and experiments could test theoretical models and thereby extend the understanding of cold atom dynamics in effective one-dimensional confinement. For bosons, the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation has successfully modeled dynamical behavior in a wide range of conditions. For fermions, a determinantal wavefunction with one particle in each basis state has been used, as in atomic theory. Dynamics calculations in effective one-dimensional (1D) potentials intermediate between bosonic and fermionic limits have been pursued only in special cases, such as a pure harmonic potential. Recent time-independent matrix diagonalization approaches to dynamical processses will be adapted. To extend the range of applications of theory for cold atoms in 1D, it is also worth considering hydrodynamic approaches without the usual simplification of small departures from equilibrium. <br/><br/>Current work on the production of cold molecules via Feshbach resonance states has been limited primarily to molecules composed of potassium and rubidium. These atoms react on collision to make potassium and rubidium molecules. Molecules composed of sodium and potassium do not have this problem, so methods to produce cold NaK are being pursued in several laboratories. This work has been and will continue to have the goal of analyzing available spectroscopic data to accurately model a large number of possible intermediate molecular energy levels to select the optimum pathway for production of cold NaK molecules from cold Na and K atoms. This approach to diatomic molecular energy structure employs direct fits of experimental data to energy levels computed from numerical potentials and spin-orbit coupling functions. This is in contrast to the traditional Dunham expansions over vibrational and rotational parameters, which are quite satisfactory for unperturbed states, but which cannot easily be used to characterize singlet-triplet perturbation effects. This approach is motivated by the fact that singlet-triplet mixing is crucial in the stepwise formation of singlet cold molecules from typically triplet Feshbach resonance states."
0.149323,"This award funds the activities of Professor Matthew Reece at Harvard University.<br/><br/>The Standard Model of particle physics was developed nearly forty years ago and explains the vast majority of experimental data at distances as small as one one-thousandth the size of a proton. Nonetheless, it leaves behind many mysteries. Why is the gravitational force between two fundamental particles vastly weaker than the other forces? What is the dark matter that is far more prevalent in our universe than normal matter, but transparent to light and so far detected only through its gravitational effects? This research aims to provide theoretical support to the diverse experimental programs that are probing these and other questions. It will propose new strategies for analyzing data and extracting signals from the huge backgrounds present at the Large Hadron Collider experiments. This research will also build new models that will highlight discovery opportunities that current experimental searches may be missing. It will also study the implications of new experimental results for important paradigms like naturalness, which have shaped theoretical physics but still require a confrontation with experiment. The broader impact of this proposal will be include serving as a resource for local high school physics teachers and helping to communicate recent discoveries in physics to young students. By working with the existing, successful outreach program Physics Theorynet, which has built connections with Boston-area high schools, the PI will visit local high schools to answer student questions, explain the interplay between theory and experiment that goes into developments like the Higgs discoveries, and help students understand the career options available to them in science.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award will proceed in several interconnected directions. It will assess the status of scenarios for natural supersymmetric theories, including the class of models called Stealth Supersymmetry developed by the PI. This will be done through simulation of the predictions of these models for existing LHC searches and through planning of how new, focused searches could better test these models. It will also assess the status of cosmology and dark matter in fine-tuned supersymmetric models, and develop a better understanding of how R-parity violation could evade overproduction of dark matter in scenarios with low-scale reheating temperatures. The research will help to ensure that the LHC experiments do not overlook possible long-lived particles, which could reveal the existence of new, higher scales to motivate future experiments. It will also study the connection between possible indirect detection signals of dark matter from space and hidden-sector physics that can be probed in high-precision terrestrial experiments. The PI will also study aspects of quantum field theory underlying all of these topics. By working on a broad research program, the PI will provide theoretical tools to maximize the impact of our very exciting, data-rich era."
0.12,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Adrienne Erickcek at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. <br/><br/>The evolution of the Universe during its first second is unknown. While there is strong evidence that the Universe's first second included a period of accelerated expansion called inflation, we do know why inflation happened or why it ended. We also do not know how the Universe transitioned to a hot, radiation-dominated state after inflation. Furthermore, our ignorance of the dynamics of the early Universe severely limits our understanding of the origins of dark matter, which is a poorly understood source of mass that currently makes up about 25% of the Universe's energy density. Many proposed explanations for dark matter postulate that dark matter originated from the hot plasma that filled the Universe during its first second. Consequently, the evolution of the Universe during that time affects the relationship between the properties of the dark matter particle and amount of dark matter in the Universe. This project will enhance our understanding of inflation, the onset of radiation domination, and the origins of dark matter by using gamma-ray observations to constrain the abundance of the smallest gravitationally bound structures of dark matter. <br/><br/>The PI will engage undergraduate students, high school students, and the general public in the proposed investigation of dark matter microhalos. Undergraduate students will analyze simulations of microhalo formation, thereby learning data analysis techniques and scientific programming. They will also gain first-hand research experience, which will expose them to the excitement of STEM careers. A module on dark matter will be developed for high school students to give them the opportunity to analyze publically available kinematic data for dwarf spheroidal and spiral galaxies. The PI will then lead four professional development workshops at teacher conferences to train high school teachers to use this module in their physics courses. Finally, the PI will present her research at Morehead?s monthly Carolina Science Cafe, which provides the general public the opportunity to interact with a scientific researcher in an informal setting.<br/><br/>These small dark matter structures, called microhalos, grow from density perturbations that were generated during inflation on scales that are inaccessible by other cosmological observations. They also began to evolve during the Universe's first second, prior to the onset of nucleosynthesis. This project will extend the PI's earlier analyses of microhalos' capacity to probe the evolution of the early Universe to a wider range of dark matter particles and will use N-body simulations of small volumes at high redshifts to test these analytical predictions for the microhalo abundance. These simulations will also determine how the properties of the small-scale density perturbations affect the microhalos' internal structures. The PI will then calculate the expected gamma-ray emission from dark matter annihilation within these microhalos. The resulting constraints on the small-scale primordial density fluctuations and the onset of radiation domination will determine which inflationary models are compatible with thermal-relic dark matter and may break the degeneracy between the relic density of dark matter and the evolution of the early Universe."
7.622786,"This award addresses the fundamental physics and technology of modern accelerators through a program aimed at investigating and understanding the phenomena driving the behavior of compact, high power beams. This includes studies of bright sources and RF superconductivity. In addition, the extensive instrumentation and flexibility of the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) will provide a framework to carry a program of accelerator science studies. A better understanding of the physics and behavior of particle beams and related technology paves the way for new accelerators that are ever more powerful probes of materials, biological systems, molecules, atoms, nuclei and the most fundamental particles in nature. Research accelerators may be used to develop new drugs, to design lighter and stronger jet engine components, or better battery technology. Accelerators are tools of discovery that may inspire young scientists to explore our universe. Future accelerators may also enable the manufacture of smaller computer chips, more effective border security, and a safer food supply. This program will also train future accelerator scientists. The participating graduate and postdoctoral students will have the opportunity to operate state of the art particle accelerators, and to advance the understanding of accelerated beams and beam technology. The operational experience will prepare them for leadership roles in accelerator science and future accelerators. The public will also gain deeper understanding of accelerator-based research through guided tours of the Cornell facilities.<br/><br/>Superconducting RF (SRF) is by far the most energy efficient means of accelerating a beam of charged particles. The Cornell SRF research will focus on the physics of microwave superconductivity. The physics that limits the performance and efficiency of SRF cavities will be studied in order to improve the technology and advance the capabilities of future accelerators. The combination of state of the art SRF expertise and technology with Cornell's world's brightest electron source provides an experimental program focused on very high power beams. The high energy storage ring CESR is the vehicle for systematic study of the phenomena that emerge and ultimately limit particle density in very compact beams, thereby contributing to studies of fourth generation synchrotron light x-ray sources and electron positron colliders, building on past work that has led to the design of damping rings for linear and circular colliders. The particle source ultimately determines the quality of the accelerated beam and the power it can deliver. As part of this award, new electron source materials will be developed with a thorough understanding of material properties that is supported by theoretical considerations as well as direct measurements."
0.18,"This work is on the theoretical physics of measurements in quantum mechanical systems. There are two components to this research. First, light scattering is used as a method to measure the properties of an atomic system. At the true quantum level, light arrives at a detector as individual photon counts. Light scattering in a model system is simulated exactly, and then simulation results will be used to develop statistical techniques to extract information about the system even if there are only a few isolated photon counts. In a related issue, to enable full transfer of quantum mechanical information between light and a collection of atoms, the atomic sample should ideally be dense and cold. Massive numerical simulations of light propagation in a cold dense gas have shown that the current understanding of such systems is flawed. New principles will be formulated that govern this case. This work is pure basic research, and the final aim is to help build the science basis for future quantum technologies.<br/><br/>A Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential is used as a generic example to study light scattering from a material sample. The light is assumed to be monitored using detectors capable of single-photon resolution. The quantum mechanics of the joint light-matter-detector system is solved exactly using quantum trajectory simulations. A Bayesian inference is developed as a method to extract the maximum possible amount of information about the atoms from the observed photon counts. The immediate aim is to devise repeated and correlated photon counting measurements for monitoring and feedback control of quantum systems. More generally, light scattering is the method to monitor not only double-well condensates, but also probably the majority of atomic systems under continuous observation. To reach a resolution at the level of a single quantum, the sample has to be optically thick. The potentially high densities and the low temperatures beneficial for quantum coherence will bring in the possibility of cooperative response of the atoms to light. Cooperative light-atom interaction using classical-electrodynamics simulations of light propagation in a medium of point dipoles will be studied. The objective is to find out how the cooperative response alters the results of light scattering experiments."
0.309986,"This project will address some of the current challenges in our understanding of the proton: the proton radius puzzle, whereby the highly precise muonic hydrogen measurement of the radius is seven standard deviations from the currently accepted value from electron-based measurements; and measurement of the scalar and spin polarizabilities of the proton. <br/><br/>Recent theoretical calculations of the proton scalar polarizabilities describe the data as well as dispersion-relation-based analyses, but produce a magnetic polarizability twice that of the dispersion analyses. The spin polarizabilities are predicted within many theoretical frameworks, but, until recently, experimental measurement of these properties was unfeasible. We will perform a series of singly- and doubly-polarized Compton scattering measurements to provide a high quality extraction of the scalar polarizabilities, and a world-first independent extraction of all four spin polarizabilities. The measurement program will be carried out within the framework of the A2 Collaboration at the MAinzer MIkrotron accelerator in Mainz, Germany, where the PI is a lead PI on the polarizability program.<br/><br/>The MUon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) at the Paul Scherer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland will access the proton radius for the first time via muon scattering, achieving a level of precision comparable with the current electron scattering data. The beam, a mixture of muons, pions and electrons / positrons, will be employed in both charge states and electron and muon scattering data will be taken in parallel. This will allow for an extraction of the radius from both proton and muon elastic scattering to a level of precision comparable with that currently obtained in electron scattering experiments. In so doing, it provides a thorough test of lepton universality, two-photon-exchange corrections relevant to the extraction of the radius from the scattering data and accesses regions where possible beyond standard model physics is postulated to occur. The two photon exchange corrections will be further tested in a complementary dilepton photoproduction experiment at the High Intensity Gamma Source (HIGS) at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) in North Carolina.<br/>--------------<br/>All visible matter with which we interact is formed of atoms, which are in turn composed of neutrons, protons and electrons. We know that the nucleons: the protons and neutrons themselves have substructure: components known as quarks. As these quarks are so strongly bound together, it is impossible for us to pull them apart in order to examine the internal structure and binding of the proton. Instead we have to form theories of how they might be bound together, and make predictions based on those theories which we can test experimentally in order to gain understanding of these building blocks of our everyday lives. It is a little like looking at a catalogue of Lego models and trying to infer the shape and binding mechanisms of the bricks from the possible configurations in the catalogue. We will investigate two properties of the proton in this proposal: its radius and polarizabilities. In so doing, we aim to gain a better understanding of this fundamental building block of the universe and, though it, to better understand the strengths and limitations of current theoretical models of nuclear physics. These models influence many modern technologies such as those involved in nuclear power or radiotherapy treatment, and determine how the stars burn in the sky. <br/><br/>The involvement of undergraduate and graduate research students in international research offers excellent training opportunities both in physics and in international relationships. The leadership of a young female PI will hopefully encourage more individuals from underrepresented groups to consider a career in the natural sciences."
0.015,"Plasmas (i.e., charged, ionized gases) are pervasive. From stellar nurseries to the Earth's ionosphere, plasmas represent a fourth state of matter that is the most common form of matter in the visible universe. Moreover, a phenomenon known as a ""dusty"" or ""complex"" plasma is formed when charged particulate matter, such as dust or ices, becomes incorporated in the plasma environment. In space, phenomena such as in comet tails or the rings of Saturn are examples of dusty plasmas. Closer to Earth, control over particulates in plasmas are important in high-technology and microelectronic fabrication. In both astrophysical and technological plasmas, the presence of magnetic fields can have a profound influence on the properties of the plasma. This research project supports a new, state-of-the-art, multi-user, superconducting, high-magnetic device to understand the basic properties of a strongly magnetized plasmas and magnetized dusty plasma. The intellectual merit of this work is that it will enable the study of new regimes of plasma physics and dusty plasma physics that have not been accessible in previous experiments. The main project goal is to investigate how the structural, thermal, charging, and stability properties of a dusty plasma evolve as the system is taken from an unmagnetized state through a progression of regimes where first the electrons, then the ions, and then charged microparticles become magnetized.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work is substantial. This project is a direct collaboration among three US universities (Auburn University, The University of Iowa, and University of California-San Diego) that perform leading research in the field of dusty plasmas. The researchers from these three organizations will coordinate a broad team of collaborators representing universities, national laboratories, and international partners. And, this project will provide excellent opportunities to train the next generation of plasma scientists through the training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as providing partnerships with dusty plasma researchers at predominantly undergraduate institutions."
0.26,"The goal of this project is to provide a detailed verifiable explanation of the origin of the heating of the solar atmosphere. Most of the light reaching Earth originates at the 'surface' of the sun, a region called the photosphere. However, the regions of the solar atmosphere immediately above this surface, the solar chromosphere and corona, create most of the dangerous Ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation. These regions also generate the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that pass the Earth at speeds in excess of 400km/s. Both the rapidly changing radiation and the solar wind create hazards for spacecraft, astronauts, and have a number of important terrestrial impacts. A long-standing mystery has prevented scientists from understanding and accurately modeling the chromosphere and corona. A short distance above the 'surface' of the sun, the solar atmosphere's temperature jumps up by a factor of two to three. The goal of this project is to provide an explanation of the origin of this heating. The project will also provide opportunities to recruit and train student researchers in plasma and solar physics, simulations, and modeling at the Boston University. Many of the Boston University PI's undergraduate research advisees, about half of whom are women, have continued on to graduate school. <br/><br/>This research will examine whether solar plasma flows emerging from the photosphere can transfer sufficient energy into turbulent plasma of the solar atmosphere, which, in turn, will heat the chromosphere sufficiently to explain whether the observed UV spectra originate there. It will also evaluate whether this mechanism can account for chromospheric spectral observations. This requires four linked research tasks: (1) solving for plasma drifts and fields when a convecting neutral gas pushes it across magnetic field lines; (2) analyzing the theory of streaming instabilities applicable to the collisional plasma found there; (3) performing a series of kinetic simulations to explore the nonlinear and thermal properties of the resulting turbulence; and (4) incorporating the resulting electron heating into a radiative transport code in order to evaluate its impact on chromospheric radiance. This research combines several research areas encompassed by the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Science and Engineering."
0.24,"This project will investigate the physical properties of a near-surface layer of a plasma, a plasma sheath, which forms when a solid body is placed into a plasma. Plasmas are gases consisting of free ions and electrons; they are abundant in the universe, have many industrial applications and are the critical component of controlled fusion research. Nearly a half of the manufacturing steps necessary to fabricate a computer microprocessor employ plasmas. The interaction of plasmas with materials depends on the region close to the surfaces known as the plasma sheath. Better understanding of sheaths will lead to improved microprocessor fabrications and might be essential in achieving controlled fusion. The tabletop experiments employed in this study are also ideal for, and will greatly contribute to, training of students in the field of plasma physics and other STEM fields. <br/><br/>Proposed new and continuing experiments are aimed at establishing the basic properties of sheaths and associated presheaths, which accelerate ions to the sheath. The specific questions that will be addressed are: 1. What are the details of the newly recognized instability-enhanced collisional friction? 2. What happens to the anisotropy of ion velocity distribution functions (IVDFs) along the presheath and at the sheath-edge? 3. Why do experimental transverse IVDF results differ from simulations? 4. Are the ions in three species weakly collisional plasmas all lost at the system sound velocity when they have comparable densities? 5. Are there separate presheaths associated with ion-neutral collisions and oblique magnetic fields? 6. How do sheaths and presheaths at dielectric and mixed boundaries differ from those at conductors? 7. Does the sheath disappear or not when a small electrode is biased to the plasma potential? Coordinated studies of these phenomena will be carried out at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of San Diego. Experiments will determine the presheath and sheath plasma potential profiles and the resulting IVDFs associated with ion acceleration. Most of the experiments will be carried out in Madison and led by the PI Prof. Noah Hershkowitz. Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) diagnostic development will be carried out on both campuses and led by the Co-PI Prof. Greg Severn. Plasma parameters will be determined with two or more techniques, e.g. combinations of emissive probes, LIF, Langmuir probes, ion acoustic wave measurements, and optical emission spectroscopy. Experiments will employ hot filament multi-dipole, capacitive, inductive, and helicon sources currently in operation."
0.36,"Endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane (ER/PM) junctions are known to be sites of calcium ion (Ca2+) influx. Recently, the PI discovered that these junctions function as trafficking hubs for insertion and removal of plasma membrane proteins. Furthermore, the PI has found that the voltage gated potassium channel Kv2.1 interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum, dramatically increasing ER/PM junction surface area and structurally changing the junction morphology. The PI's findings show that the Kv2.1 potassium channel remodels to cortical ER, which is likely within 30 nm of the plasma membrane. Kv2.1 is playing a structural role similar to that of Orai, for the PI proposes that Kv2.1 is binding an ER membrane protein. Thus, Kv2.1-mediated ER enrichment on the cell surface is a novel specialized organelle with specific functions in protein transport vital to cell signaling. <br/><br/>The current project focuses on understanding the biology of ER/PM junctions with particular emphasis on the regulation of the ER/PM junction structure and its function in the modulation of membrane protein trafficking. The PI will answer the following questions: What is the role of Kv2.1 in protein trafficking at ER/PM junctions? How are ER/PM junctions dynamically regulated by Kv2.1? What are the relationships between the cortical cytoskeleton, ER, and Kv2.1? Which theoretical framework can be used to describe the assembly and maintenance of these domains? How does large-scale membrane behavior emerge from the interactions between Kv2.1 and ER? The fusion of multicolor single-molecule tracking in living cells and advanced stochastic process analysis, which are integral to the project, will provide answer to these questions. This research will offer excellent opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student participation in interdisciplinary research through the collaboration between two laboratories with very different backgrounds. The research program will be integrated with an outreach component by developing a microscopy laboratory for students at a local elementary school. The goal of the outreach program is to foster scientific enquiry and to motivate students to appreciate science from an early age. This lab presents a unique opportunity to leverage integration of education and research, giving students access to hands-on practical learning.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.832109,"High-energy cosmic rays are important cosmic messengers that are producing new insights about extreme processes in the universe. The Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory has measured millions of cosmic rays. Some of the most interesting are protons or atomic nuclei, whose arrival directions are correlated with the large-scale distribution of matter within 250 million light years of the Earth and thereby reveal which astrophysical objects are capable of producing these extremely high energy particles. A primary advantage of the Auger Observatory in studying cosmic rays is its complementary ground detector array, which detects the cascade of particles produced in the atmosphere by the parent cosmic ray, and ultraviolet telescopes, which image the pattern of nitrogen fluorescence generated by the passage of the particle cascade through the atmosphere. Combining these two techniques provides the best possible measurements of these rarest of particles. <br/><br/>The Auger group at Pennsylvania State University has been involved with the Auger project since 1992. With this award they will continue their work to resolve the issues involved in utilizing the two detection techniques and exploit the Auger measurements to deduce properties of particle interactions at energies far beyond the reach of laboratory studies on Earth.<br/><br/>The Pennsylvania State University group will continue their established series of popular week-long summer workshops for high school teachers that are based around new results in cosmology and high-energy astrophysics. The concepts of basic college physics are interwoven into the curriculum, so that teachers strengthen their working knowledge of their core curriculum while getting an inside look at what is happening at the forefront of astrophysics research. The teachers are provided with knowledge and tools to use in their classrooms, to inspire and engage their students, and to enrich their understanding of the scientific method."

In a subset of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small cell lung cancer with specific mutations, these therapies lead to dramatic clinical responses in a significant proportion of patients. However, in the majority of AML and subset of lung cancer patients who respond to anti-cancer therapies, therapeutic relapse subsequently ensues, although often after a considerable interval, such that these responses do not lead to long-term cures. In this project the PIs will use theoretical physics and mathematical modeling approaches to investigate the process of response to treatment, the basis for persistence of a subset of cells during clinical response, and the mechanisms driving subsequent therapeutic relapse in these two tumor types. This integrative approach will involve genomic, transcriptional, and phenotypic assays of tumors at the various stages of therapeutic response and resistance. As such, this project is expected to lead to a more fundamental understanding of the evolution of drug resistance and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed to prevent the emergence of clinical resistance. Although the efforts in this project will focus on lung cancer and AML, the results and approaches described herein will have broader relevance to oncology and are aimed to uncover general principles and models, which are relevant to the spectrum of human cancers. <br/><br/>The integrative approach in this project will lead to major advances in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic evolution of cancer. The studies into the genetic and mechanistic basis for therapeutic relapse, and the detailed genetic, epigenetic, and functional studies of EGFR mutant lung cancer and AML patient samples before therapy, at the time of maximal clinical response, and at disease relapse will allow the PIs to obtain detailed datasets from DNA sequencing and gene expression profiling to probe the dynamics of the genetic and epigenetic diversity at different phases of disease. In turn, this will guide the development of quantitative models of the evolutionary processes that can then be tested in the laboratory. The interplay between the modeling and data will guide strategies for future data collection and in vitro experiments to functionally test hypotheses that emanate from the modeling studies."

0.12,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. LZ is a ~7-tonne liquid xenon (LXe) dark matter detector to be installed at the 4850-foot level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, to look for dark matter. This work will contribute to the design of that detector. Development of technology related to LXe will find use in the increasing number of experiments worldwide using noble liquids as detection materials. These projects will also result in technical training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate and undergraduate students. LXe has practical applications to gamma ray imaging for astrophysics, Homeland Security, and medical imaging.<br/><br/>This detector will use established liquid xenon time projection chamber technology with readout of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification, together with 3-D position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the liquid xenon, removal of surface artifacts, and calibration of position-dependent response functions. The design also features a gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator veto that will hermetically enclose the central xenon detector and provide powerful tagging of background neutrons and gammas. The LZ experiment will have world-leading sensitivity to WIMP dark matter with a sensitivity about 400 times better than current results and covering a substantial range of theoretically motivated candidates. This award will provide funding to enable this research group to continue to contribute to the LZ dark matter experiment with work on the cathode high voltage delivery system."
0.56,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Christopher Carone, Joshua Erlich, and Marc Sher at the College of William and Mary. <br/><br/>The Standard Model of particle physics provides a consistent description of all known elementary particles and their interactions. However, there are many features of the theory that remain mysterious and suggest that the Standard Model is incomplete: How must the theory be modified to explain the observed pattern of elementary particle masses? How must the theory be extended to explain the observational evidence for the existence of dark matter? Is the relatively small mass of the recently discovered Higgs boson hinting at a more complicated spectrum of Higgs-sector particles yet to be discovered? The intellectual merit of the work proposed by Professors Carone, Erlich and Sher stems from its focus on addressing these and other fundamental issues, which will help to advance our understanding of the physics of the elementary particles. With the restart of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and with new results from dark matter detectors imminent, one expects exciting new discoveries in the near future, and the PIs' research will be well timed to explore the results from these experiments. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. The Broader Impact of this work is that it furthers the education of undergraduate and PhD research students, including those from underrepresented groups, facilitates outreach to the general public, and promotes high-energy particle physics in the southeastern part of the United States.<br/><br/>As part of their specific research projects, the PIs anticipate progress along several distinct lines. On the issue of fermion masses, the PIs and their students will study model-independent bounds and cosmological consequences of pseudo-familons - particles that may be light enough to be experimentally accessible even though they are originate from new flavor physics associated with a very high energy scale. On the issue of dark matter, the PIs and their students will consider new models in which a dark sector of particles arises dynamically, such as certain supersymmetric ""moose"" models in which non-perturbative physics associated with a strongly coupled dark sector drives a messenger sector gauge coupling to very small values. On the issue of Higgs-sector physics, the PIs will study novel two-Higgs doublet models, one class that avoids flavor-changing-neutral currents via non-Abelian discrete symmetries and another class extended as in the Lee-Wick Standard Model, providing numerous predictive relations between heavy Higgs masses and couplings. They will explore the implications of these models for the LHC. In addition to these investigations, the PIs and their students will also consider other fundamental issues, for example, attempting to elucidate the appearance of black-hole horizons in gravity duals of finite-temperature theories by matching appropriate calculations in dual gauge-gravity models to perturbative finite-temperature quantum chromodynamics. Carone, Erlich and Sher will also continue activities that provide a substantial broader impact, including the supervision of undergraduate, PhD, and REU research students, participation in local events (for example, QuarkNet), and continued interaction with local and national media on particle-physics issues."

0.301604,"This project seeks to answer the question ""what is the nature of dark matter""? Dark matter is invisible, yet it is known to exist with about five times more abundance in the universe than the ordinary matter (like stars) we can see. Although the astronomical evidence of dark matter is overwhelming, so far nobody has detected it in the laboratory, and we know almost nothing about it. Many attempts to seek dark matter as fundamental particles of nature have so far failed. Our project will search for a different possible type of dark matter known as topological defects, predicted by some models of how the universe formed. Our approach to detect topological defects is by observing their predicted effect on atomic clocks, the most precise instruments ever devised. Specifically, we will use existing data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) and seek the tiny effects of dark matter on time kept by atomic clocks connected to GPS instruments. Since the GPS system and the atomic clocks already exist and are paid for, this is a relatively low-budget project with high potential payoff. If topological defects do exist and we find them, this would help set our understanding of the universe on a more sure footing. Likewise, it would also be valuable to be able to rule out this possibility with a small margin of error, to help science focus on more likely explanations. In this way, such investigations promote the progress of science. Society also benefits in terms of new technologies that can only be made possible with the unpredictable knowledge that comes with scientific progress.<br/><br/><br/>Understanding the nature of dark matter remains one of top outstanding problems in physics today. Some models predict dark matter in a form of stable configurations of light fields, the topological defects (TD). The presence of TDs may lead to occasional transient changes of particle masses and coupling constants, thus giving a distinct signature that can be searched for with the network of sensitive atomic clocks. This project will use atomic clocks of the existing GPS satellite constellation and ground station network as a 50,000 km-aperture sensor array. Data from this detector have been accumulated over 15 years and are publicly available. The PI, an expert in precision positioning and timing, will conduct the GPS data processing by customizing the NASA/JPL software GIPSY/OASIS of which he is a co-author. The output will be a time series of clock phase for all GPS satellites and ground stations, which we have demonstrated can be monitored with a precision of ~0.1 ns. If DM exists in the form of macroscopic TDs, then there is a chance to discover this with this macroscopic experiment. Assuming TDs exist in sufficient abundance, then the Earth would pass through these TDs occasionally. For TDs that pass through the GPS system at galactic speeds ~300 km/sec, TDM-SM coupling would lead to transients in fundamental physical constants, which would cause a sequence of transients in atomic clock frequency, hence producing step-like functions in clock phase across an aperture of ~200 s for the GPS constellation, and ~40 s for ground stations. Since GPS carrier phase data is routinely acquired with few-mm precision at intervals of 1 s, detecting ~1 ns signals in the atomic clock phase over a 200-s aperture is easily achievable. Observing such a signature would provide decisive evidence of the existence of TDs with a high confidence level, as there is no known mechanism for background events that would mimic such a signature. Non-observation will place constraints on certain new-physics couplings."
0.27,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Vilenkin at Tufts University.<br/><br/>The theory of cosmic inflation, which was proposed as a speculative hypothesis 35 years ago, has by now accumulated substantial observational support and has become the leading cosmological paradigm. This theory has also led to a major change in our global view of the universe. According to the new worldview, much of the volume in the universe is in the state of explosive inflationary expansion. We live in a ""bubble"" where inflation has ended, but it will never end in the entire universe. The total volume of inflating regions continues to grow, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed. The major goal of the proposed research is to learn how this ""multiverse"" scenario can be tested observationally and to investigate its implications for the beginning of the universe. The multiverse worldview has far-reaching implications beyond physics. It provides a dramatically new perspective on the global structure of the universe and on our place in it. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the understanding of the properties of the universe. Professor Vilenkin will also involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. He will continue his efforts to communicate the ideas of modern cosmology to the general public, in the form of public lectures, popular articles, and interviews for radio and TV. He will also write a textbook, emphasizing the new worldview, based on his undergraduate cosmology course, which is aimed at students with no preparation in science.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Vilenkin will investigate the possibility of a direct test of the multiverse scenario by observing collisions of our bubble with other bubbles, or with topological defects that could nucleate in the inflating background. Possible observational effects of such collisions will be studied using both analytic and numerical methods. A complementary approach is to analyze the statistical properties of the multiverse and use them to derive predictions for the observed values of the constants of Nature in our bubble. This approach will be pursued, with the main focus on the statistics of different states in the multiverse and of the transition rates between them. The general problem of making predictions in the multiverse, known as the measure problem, will also be addressed."
0.15,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Nikolaos Kidonakis at Kennesaw State University.<br/><br/>The research project of Professor Kidonakis concerns elementary particle physics that is relevant to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is the highest-energy particle collider in the world. By colliding protons against each other at high energies at the LHC, physicists expect to learn about the fundamental particles of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored. The top quark is the most massive fundamental particle that has been discovered, it has many unique properties, and thus it is a central part of the physics program at the LHC. The Higgs boson is the particle responsible for mass generation, its discovery at the LHC was a major discovery in physics, and the further elucidation of its properties is a high priority. In his research, Professor Kidonakis aims to develop theoretical methods to make precise predictions for processes at the LHC. In particular, Professor Kidonakis will improve theoretical predictions for top-quark production as well as for Higgs production by performing state-of-the-art calculations. As a result, the project research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of elementary particles and new physical laws. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Kidonakis will involve students in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. He also intends to give public lectures on his research results, and introduce material into course curricula that emerge from his research.<br/><br/>More technically, the objective of the proposed research of Professor Kidonakis is to calculate higher-order perturbative corrections to improve theoretical predictions for top-quark production and Higgs production in the Standard Model and in models of new physics. High-order corrections, including collinear, soft-gluon, and subleading logarithmic corrections, will be calculated for differential and total cross sections. The inclusion of these corrections is necessary to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions by reducing uncertainty due to scale variation. Differential distributions are very important because they are sensitive to new physics. These calculations will be performed both for Standard-Model processes and for processes beyond the Standard Model, such as in supersymmetric models or models with flavor-changing neutral currents. The results of the project will be crucial in making state-of-the-art predictions for benchmark processes and for the interpretation of data from the LHC. The research findings will be widely disseminated through publication in refereed journals and presentations at international conferences and workshops, and through contacts with experimenters at the LHC."
0.1,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Sonia Paban at the University of Texas at Austin.<br/><br/>A wealth of experimental data over the past two decades has led to a successful model of the evolution of the universe known as the Ë-CDM model. This model includes a sudden moment when space-time started expanding, followed by a period of exponential expansion known as cosmic inflation. At the end of cosmic inflation the universe looked pretty much the same in all directions and did not have a center; there were only slight variations due to the quantum nature of the fields. These predictions of cosmic inflation match extremely well the recent data collected on the Cosmic Microwave Background, and they are fairly robust in that they are mostly, but not completely, independent of the detailed structure of space-time before inflation began. Professor Paban will investigate whether the precision of future planned experiments is sufficient to shed light on that detailed structure. Another aspect of this project relates to quantum tunneling: a quantum particle can sometimes cross a barrier via a transition which is forbidden for a classical particle. One proposed explanation of dark energy involves the multiverse --- a landscape of universes. Transitions in the multiverse happen via quantum tunneling. Models of the multiverse contain a large number of fields, whereas most of what we know about quantum tunneling has been limited to a single field. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of the universe. Professor Paban will investigate the dependence of the tunneling rate on the number of fields. The broader impacts of this grant includes the mentoring of graduate students, who will collaborate in this research, as well as Professor Paban's continued mentoring of underrepresented minority undergraduate students.<br/><br/>More technically, inflation has the power to erase initial anisotropies on the metric in few e-foldings. For this reason, it has been assumed that it will be impossible to tell if the pre-inflationary metric was anisotropic. Previous work by Paban and collaborators indicates that with the increased precision of projected observations (e.g., the 21cm experiments) it will be possible to exclude or detect such a scenario when the number of e-foldings is around 60. The work proposed here will tell if there is also a distinctive signature for Large Scale Structure measurements, ì-distortion measurements, and observations of oscillations in the power spectrum through a polarization measurement. This research will also determine if there is a distinctive signature in these three future experiments for inflationary periods that are preceded by tunneling and a period of fast-roll. Recent work claims that tunneling in a multi-dimensional space of fields is enhanced as the number of fields grows. This proposal seeks to reproduce or invalidate these results by means of independent computations, including use of exact results and numerical Monte Carlo techniques."
0.28,"This award will provide support for a group with one PI, a postdoc and a student to work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC is a large, complex machine that accelerates protons to unprecedented energies, allowing for discovery of elementary particles more massive than any yet observed. One of the LHC's recent discoveries was to find a candidate for the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts with amazing accuracy for the observed interactions of particles forming the visible matter in the universe. The next step is to capitalize on the LHC to look for evidence for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) to address difficulties known to exist in the SM. This group will continue to work on the ATLAS experiment to look for decays of the Higgs particle as the LHC begins operations at twice the energy ever studied before. The PI will continue to communicate the excitement that the Higgs discovery generated as a means of attracting students into the study of science through such activities as giving lectures on Physics at the LHC to high school students in Albany and the Honors College students at the university, organizing and holding Q&A sessions after the screening of the movie ""Particle Fever"" in local area theaters, and participating in the online ""Adopt-a-Physicist"" program run by the American Physical Society.<br/><br/>The LHC has completed one successful run. During this, a candidate for the Higgs Boson was found, a major triumph. Though doubts linger, many physicists believe the new particle is the Higgs Boson long predicted by the SM. Nevertheless, more careful measurements of its rarer decay modes need to be made. Surprises are possible, and could result from BSM effects. Also, there could be more than one Higgs particle. This group has expertise in analysis of the properties of Higgs decays. The group will continue to work on the ATLAS experiment through Run2. Analyses will focus on decays of the Higgs particle revealed in Run1 to t-tbar quark jet pairs. The group will continue to improve and expand the software tools. They will also study layout designs for the inner Silicon tracker, part of the ATLAS high luminosity upgrade. These layouts will aim to maximize the efficiency for finding and reconstructing charged tracks in the challenging ATLAS upgrade environment."
0.105,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Sarah Shandera at Pennsylvania State University. There is excellent, if indirect, evidence that our universe underwent an early period of very rapid expansion (inflation) which set the stage for the evolution to the cosmology we currently observe. Although we expect that inflation can be explained in terms of particle physics, we do not yet have a precise understanding of the nature of the particles responsible. Particle interactions can be constrained by the way they induce couplings in observable properties of the cosmic density field on different scales. This research project examines the implications of coupling between scales that are observable to scales that are outside of our current cosmological window. In particular, the PI will study how observations made in a finite volume of the universe constrain particle physics models of inflation which make predictions about statistics in a much larger, unobservable, volume. The PI will also develop workshop modules for elementary and high school students based on the theme of understanding the size and dynamical evolution of the universe. <br/><br/>The PI has already shown that when the curvature inhomogeneities on very different scales are coupled, our observed universe is likely to have biased statistics compared to the mean predicted for a larger post-inflationary volume. In other words, there is a new source of cosmic variance in comparing observations in our Hubble volume to theory. Through this grant, the PI proposes to further develop the framework for constraining interacting inflation theories, compatible with observations in a finite universe. She will map out the extent to which the cosmic variance from coupling to superhorizon modes can add new uncertainties in comparing measurements of the primordial scalar curvature inhomogeneities to predictions from theory. She will work out which qualitative aspects of particle physics scenarios for inflation can be mimicked or obscured by cosmic variance."
3.01,"Overview: The principal goal of experiments in modern particle physics is to uncover new physics that underlies the Standard Model. Possible approaches include the study of physics processes at the highest available collision energies at accelerators or through studies of the very rare interactions of neutrinos. The Columbia Particle Physics group tackles both directions. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit of physics at the highest available collision energies: A goal of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (the LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland is to understand the nature of the Higgs Boson, recently discovered there in 2012, and to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. <br/><br/>These goals are relevant to the understanding of the Universe at its most fundamental level in the fleeting fraction of a second just after the Big Bang, and to why we see the Universe as we do now. To meet the challenges of this quest, new theories are advanced, new detectors and accelerators are developed and built, and new computing and analytical methodologies are created, all of which have significant broader impact for the training of young scientists in the near term and the advancement of technological benefits to society over the longer term. <br/><br/>The next three years represent a transition of the LHC physics program from a collision energy of 8 TeV data-taking and operation, to extended operations and data taking at nearly double the energy, 13-14 TeV. Over a thousand scientists from the United States are involved with this scientific program on several major experiments.<br/><br/>The Columbia team is one of the leading groups participating in the ATLAS experiment at CERN. Their contributions include extensive involvement in the scientific and technical management of the experiment, substantial contributions to the maintenance and operations and upgrades of the key detectors for energy measurement, the Liquid Argon Calorimetry. In the search for new physics, the group is deeply involved in QCD (jet) studies including boosted jet technology, Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model studies of events with pairs of vector bosons (WW, ZZ and WZ) in the final state to search for new resonant states, gravitons and supersymmetry. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit of Neutrino Physics: Another major question is what happened to all the antimatter in the universe? Fundamental symmetry arguments suggest that matter and antimatter should have been produced in equal abundance in the early universe, but now all we see is matter. A key to unraveling this mystery may lie with elusive particles called neutrinos, which are abundant in the universe, but which barely interact with matter. There are three of these particles known. Why three? And what are the masses of these particles? Are there more? Experiments are underway to understand these phenomena and to see if more than three neutrinos exist.<br/><br/>The Columbia group is completing is contributions to an earlier reactor-based neutrino experiment called Double CHOOZ and is now heavily involved in a new experiment named MicroBOONE, which is coming online at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. This program will address several of the key questions in neutrino physics including the search of additional neutrinos as well as advance an important new technology for the field, the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber. The Columbia group has major responsibilities for the readout electronics of the Time Projection Chamber and triggering system, detector simulation, data acquisition software, and physics analysis.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: A principal focus of the Columbia group over many years and strengthened with this award is the training of undergraduate students through their highly successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer program. This program has demonstrated a commitment to the inclusion of under-represented groups, including many students from undergraduate-only institutions. Follow-up tracking has shown an impressive rate of success for graduates of their programs to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields."
0.33,"This award funds the LHC Theory Initiative, a competitive national fellowship program supporting the training of postdoctoral fellows in theoretical particle physics.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of particle physics is to identify the fundamental principles that govern matter, energy, space and time. The Standard Model (SM) provides a well tested quantitative description of the known particles and forces. A body of evidence suggests that the SM is not complete, and that it is the low-energy limit of a more fundamental theory.The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) began physics operations in 2010, and on July 4, 2012, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced discovery of a new resonance with a mass near 125 GeV. Subsequent running has confirmed that the new particle looks like the long-sought Higgs boson. CERN is in the process of doubling the LHC's energy and significantly increasing its luminosity. Physics goals include precision measurements of Higgs properties, as well as direct searches for new particles, especially dark matter. Accurate theoretical predictions are needed for the LHC to realize its full potential. For example, because of the LHC's high luminosity, it can be difficult to separate signals from backgrounds. The lowest-order predictions for such processes exhibit significant uncertainties that can be reduced by including higher orders in perturbation theory. Also, it is essential to explore signatures and strategies in depth to make the most of the new discoveries and to fully exploit the physics potential of this powerful experimental facility. This fellowship program will help ensure that the United States has the young theorists it needs to gain full benefit from the investment it has made in the LHC experimental facility.<br/><br/>The activities proposed here are to provide calculational tools and theoretical results necessary to fully extract physics results from the LHC. Proposed activities include calculations of higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections in the SM and beyond-the-SM models, as well as the development of new, improved, shower algorithms. Also important is the development of robust and well-tested Monte Carlo tools to confront the data with theoretical models. Much remains to be done in these areas."
0.01,"This award supports the research of Wafic Sabra, from the American University of Beirut (AUB).<br/><br/>After the success of the unification of the fundamental particle interactions within the standard model, the most pressing question in theoretical physics has since been the unification of the laws of quantum mechanics with the theory of general relativity, as well as the incorporation of quantum gravity with the other fundamental forces in a unified theory. Superstring theory is the leading candidate for a consistent finite theory unifying quantum gravity with the other forces of nature. The phenomenology derived from superstrings may have relevance to the problems encountered in the study of the black holes, particle physics and cosmology. In recent years, a new picture has emerged pointing to the existence of a fundamental theory, M-theory. Many theories behave very nicely if there is a small parameter, since one can perturbatively expand in this parameter and make sensible predictions. This new fundamental theory behaves like string theory at the perturbative level, but at the nonperturbative level, in which there are no small parameters, it has a rich structure of symmetries connecting perturbative aspects of string theory to nonperturbative states. This project will study gravitational backgrounds in these theories, focusing on black holes in higher numbers of dimensional backgrounds. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will make it of benefit to both physicists and mathematicians working in fields related to string theory and differential geometry. It will also help in the development of the graduate programs in physics and mathematics at AUB, and in introducing students to the frontiers of research, particularly in the various fields of high energy physics. <br/><br/><br/>M-theory behaves like string theory at the perturbative level, but at the nonperturbative level has a rich structure of duality symmetries connecting perturbative excitations to solitonic states. A major development is the equivalence between string theory on anti-de Sitter spaces and certain superconformal Yang-Mills gauge theories living on the boundary of these spaces. This equivalence gave more importance to the study of gravitational anti-de Sitter configurations as they provide a tool to the study of quantum gauge field theories important for particle physics. The main focus of Sabra's supported research is: a) The study and the classification of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric gravitational backgrounds in various spacetime dimensions and in particular the search for black rings in gauged supergravity models. b)The study of gravitational instantons and their relation to integrable models, Einstein--Weyl structures and black holes in higher dimensions as well as the interpretation of Euclidean supergravity solutions in terms of string and M-theory. c) The development of our understanding of the nonperturbative theory underlying string theory, and incorporating this in the study of the phenomenological implications of string theory to gravitational physics, particle physics and cosmology"
0.39,"This project will study magnetized, collisionless shock waves. Collisionless shocks are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical environments. Magnetized shocks are produced for example by supernova explosions, by the outflow of hot gases from certain types of stars by the solar wind upstream of planetary magnetospheres, or solar flares. Astrophysical collisionless shocks will be mimicked in the laboratory using high-powered lasers. This will allow their properties to be studied in a detail not currently possible by observing them in space. Collisionless shocks in space affect the particle and field distribution throughout the universe and are believed to be the primary source of cosmic rays. The proposed experiments could open the possibility of studying astrophysics in the laboratory and advance the understanding of space and astrophysical processes such as coronal mass ejections, supernovae or the origin of cosmic rays. <br/><br/>The magnetized collisionless shocks launched in the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at UCLA will be fully characterized. In these experiments, an energetic laser pulse of several hundred joules rapidly ablates a solid target embedded in a large (17 m x 0.5 m), and magnetized ambient plasma. Collisionless coupling between the debris ions and ambient plasma accelerates the ambient ions to super-Alfvenic velocities and a self-sustained shock can separate from the laser-plasma piston and propagate through the ambient plasma over large distances. The shock will be characterized by measuring the jump of density, magnetic field, temperature and flow across the ramp in a variety of shock geometries. These experiments could potentially launch quasi-parallel (i.e. Alfvenic) shocks and find evidence of particle acceleration in a controlled laboratory setting for the very first time. The experiments will be compared to two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer simulations performed with an existing multi-dimensional hybrid code."

In the near future, the primary goals of the LHC will be to study the properties of the new particle and to search for signals of new phenomena which are not described by the current Standard Model of particle physics. Theorists need to provide precise predictions for the measured observables. Additional theoretical challenges are provided by processes with several particles in the final state and by the presence of massive particles, such as top quarks and Higgs bosons. The PIs are experts in calculations of these complicated processes, which are necessary for fully understanding the properties of the Higgs boson (and any other particles that may be discovered in the next run of the LHC).<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to apply the most advanced technical tools for the calculation of radiative corrections in QCD to processes involving real and/or virtual massive particles, such as Higgs bosons, top-quark pairs, and pairs of colored supersymmetric partners of quarks and gluons. For many observables, calculations which go beyond the currently available accuracy are necessary. The PI's plan to employ and further develop the GoSam framework for one-loop calculations, effective field theory methods which allow them to carry out the resummation of large logarithmic corrections directly in momentum space, and recently introduced methods for the analytic or numerical calculation of multiloop and multileg Feynman diagrams."
0.060265,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. LZ is a ~7-tonne liquid xenon (LXe) dark matter detector to be installed at the 4850-foot level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, to look for dark matter. This work will contribute to the design of that detector. Development of technology related to LXe will find use in the increasing number of experiments worldwide using noble liquids as detection materials. These projects will also result in technical training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate and undergraduate students. LXe has practical applications to gamma ray imaging for astrophysics, Homeland Security, and medical imaging.<br/><br/>This detector will use established liquid xenon time projection chamber technology with readout of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification, together with 3-D position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the liquid xenon, removal of surface artifacts, and calibration of position-dependent response functions. The design also features a gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator veto that will hermetically enclose the central xenon detector and provide powerful tagging of background neutrons and gammas. The LZ experiment will have world-leading sensitivity to WIMP dark matter with a sensitivity about 400 times better than current results and covering a substantial range of theoretically motivated candidates. This award will provide funding to enable this research group to continue to contribute to the LZ dark matter experiment with work on the cathode high voltage delivery system."
0.182901,"The sense of smell is important to humans? daily lives, and its loss is often a precursor to neurodegenerative diseases, but studying the human olfactory system directly, like all studies of human neural function, faces challenges due to the brain?s complexity, large number of neurons, and ethical and technical obstacles. Studying the larva's simplified olfactory system will advance understanding of the basic principles of human sense of smell. Insects are mportant disease vectors and agricultural pests who rely extensively on smells to locate food, hosts, and mates, so this work will have important applications in pest control. Undergraduates and high school students, especially from underrepresented groups, will be actively involved in the research. An additional component of this project is outreach to local elementary students, especially the creation of a program to engage students in tinkering and construction. <br/><br/>How do brains make decisions based on noisy and often conflicting sensory input? Why does the same input elicit variable behaviors, even in the simplest organisms? This project aims to use the fruit fly larva's sense of smell as a model to explore these questions by studying the olfactory system of the Drosophila larva. A given odor stimulates or inhibits a set of odor receptor neurons, yet on the basis of this pattern of stimulation, organisms from flies to humans recognize and classify odors rapidly and reliably. The PI will image the responses of odorant receptor neurons in the larva's dorsal organ (its ""nose"") to understand how olfactory information is first presented to the brain, taking advantage of the genetic tools available in Drosophila, the larva's transparency, and custom built apparatus developed in the PI's lab. A second goal of this project is to develop the technology necessary to take full advantage of the larva as a model for decoding the neural circuitry of olfaction. To move towards or away from an odor, the larva uses sensory input to drive motor output. In this process, it modulates a number of behaviors, e.g. moving forward, stopping, and sweeping the head to one side or the other. The rules by which the larva changes its motor output in response to sensory input in order to move towards a goal represent a navigational strategy. Using light activated ion channels the PI will evoke activity directly in the sensory neurons in order to measure the computations involved in transforming temporal variations in sensory input into directed motor output. The promise of the larva, a small crawling animal with a transparent skin, is that the neural activity in freely behaving animals can be visualized. In practice, we do not have a microscope capable of keeping up with a moving animal. The project will develop a microscope that can track individual neurons in a moving larva making possible to ""read the larva's mind"" as it goes about its business, allowing us to link together sensory input, neural activity, and evoked behavior in order to understand the function of neural circuits. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrated Orgamismal System, and the Emerging Frontiers program in the Biological Sciences Directorate."
0.18,"Collisions of neutron stars and black holes are very rare events, but the enormous energies they release in gravitational waves, infrared radiation, X-rays, and gamma-rays make them potentially detectable even when very far away. Their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals contain information about the properties and unknown physics of the colliding objects, but to extract this information, astronomers need theoretical models to which they can compare. For this project, computer simulations will be carried out of systems with a black hole and neutron star orbiting each other and eventually merging. Simulations will also explore the debris commonly produced by black hole-neutron star and neutron star-neutron star mergers: radioactive gas ejected into the surrounding space and hot, magnetized nuclear matter swirling around a black hole. Carrying out these simulations will involve training both graduate and undergraduate students on techniques of computer modeling in relativistic astrophysics. The resulting gravitational wave and nuclear debris data will be made available to all astronomers working to detect and characterize these events. <br/><br/>This research fills some of the most interesting remaining gaps in the modeling of inspiral, disk, and outflow phases of black hole-neutron star binary mergers using simulations with the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), a high-accuracy numerical relativity code that now includes magnetohydrodynamics, nuclear microphysics, and neutrino cooling. Simulations of long inspirals are used to test and improve algorithms for detecting and identifying the gravitational wave signals from such sources. Improvements to SpEC's treatment of flows near black hole horizons enable higher-accuracy accretion disk simulations, and these are used to study the disk dynamics, gamma ray burst, energy extraction, and late-time (tenths of a second) behavior. The project studies outflows for a wide range of binary parameters. The evolution of ejecta far from the post-merger black hole is tracked with smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and nuclear reaction network codes using SpEC data as input, enabling predictions of fallback, kilonova brightness, and nucleosynthesis."
0.135,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Adam Martin at the University of Notre Dame. The discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in July 2012 has placed the high-energy physics community in a unique, exciting place -- having available a machine dedicated to pushing into unexplored territory and a new tool, the Higgs boson, to utilize. This project aims to capitalize on this situation by squeezing the most physics out of the existing LHC dataset, looking for hints of other particles and/or forces. The hints of new particles/forces arising as the result of this project can be searched for in detail once the second phase of the CERN LHC begins in mid-2015. This work has a broad impact in that it will guide future experimental searches and involves close collaboration with experimenters, both at Notre Dame and at CERN. <br/><br/>Professor Martin's research project involves two complementary approaches. One approach is to make sure there are no `holes' in the data where new physics could hide. This requires improving existing searches, adapting searches to alternative scenarios, and even motivating new searches. Examples would include nearly degenerate supersymmetric particles, where one decays into the other with a macroscopic decay length. The second approach is to use the Higgs boson as an indirect probe of new physics, studying its properties in detail and looking for deviations. In particular, much needs to be done regarding the differential ""moments"" of Higgs production. Both approaches require a mixture of model building and collider physics. To further broaden the impact of this project, Professor Martin will collaborate with QuarkNet, an NSF-funded outreach program for high school teachers and students. He will act as an particle physics mentor, providing basic theory context for the hands-on QuarkNet activities."
0.36,"Superconducting qubits (quantum bits) are solid-state artificial atoms, comprised of Josephson tunnel junctions and superconducting interconnects and microwave resonators. When cooled to milli-Kelvin temperatures, these superconducting circuits exhibit quantum mechanical behavior, such as quantized states of flux, charge, or junction phase depending on design parameters. Such superconducting artificial atoms have already proven a useful vehicle for advancing the scientific community's general understanding of coherence in quantum mechanical systems, particularly in regimes not easily accessible with natural atoms and molecules. Moreover, superconducting qubits are promising candidates for quantum information science and technology applications, including quantum computing. The main limiting factor in using superconducting qubits is noise, The sources of noise in these systems will be studied and characterized. Established techniques from the related field of NMR (such as those used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging), for example, the targeted control sequences known as dynamical decoupling and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, will be adapted and extended. The underlying microscopic sources that destroy the quantum nature of these superconducting qubits will be identified and mitigated. While the future applications of quantum information science and technology are still being recognized, a broad social benefit from the technology itself (e.g., quantum sensors, simulation machines) is anticipated, as well as from the the ancillary spin-off technologies that will arise (e.g., materials, fabrication, control schema), and the young researchers who work to make them a reality. An educational feature of this work will be the access and participation by students in academic (MIT, U. Tokyo, Chalmers), corporate (NEC), and government (Lincoln Laboratory, RIKEN) research environments in the US, Japan, and Sweden. Via shared research and student internships, this will provide a culture that fosters young scientists with a global research perspective, capable of developing and leading interdisciplinary teams across institutional and international boundaries. <br/><br/>This work addresses the characterization, identification, and mitigation of noise sources in advanced, high-coherence superconducting qubits. One objective is to use control techniques such as dynamical decoupling to assess and mitigate noise in a new generation of these advanced qubits (2D and 3D transmons with high-Q materials, metastable flux qubit). In general, this is achieved using NMR-based techniques that are known to benchmark and elucidate microscopic noise generators in order to identify and mitigate the underlying sources of decoherence. The goal is to understand what is limiting their coherence times. The information can then be used to improve fabrication processes and materials. A second objective is further advance the noise characterization and mitigation toolset. The research will utilize a quadrature amplitude modulator and sequencer with arbitrary amplitude and phase to generate microwave pulse sequences, which will be applied to transmons and metastable flux qubits in a dilution refrigerator. Coherence characterization, including the measurement of standard coherence times, will be performed as a function of the qubit quantization axis. Randomized benchmarking, state tomography, and process tomography will be used to characterize gate fidelity. Decoherence will be mitigated through the application of dynamical decoupling pulse sequences. These techniques will also be used to measure the noise power spectral density. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy techniques will be used to assess the microscopic nature and origin of decoherence."

0.445411,"iSGTW (International Science Grid This Week) is a unique international weekly online publication that covers distributed computing and the research it enables. They report on all aspects of distributed computing technology, such as grids and clouds. They also regularly feature articles on distributed computing-enabled research in a large variety of disciplines, including physics, biology, sociology, earth sciences, archaeology, medicine, disaster management, crime, and art. (Note that they do not cover stories that are purely about commercial technology) In its current incarnation, iSGTW is also an online destination where you can host a profile and blog, and find and disseminate announcements and information about events, deadlines, and jobs. What many people outside of particle physics may not know is that distributed computing played a crucial role in the race towards the discovery of the Higgs Boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. <br/><br/>At present, each issue of iSGTW includes three feature articles, a visual, and a spotlight. Visuals present opportunities to showcase something graphic in nature, such as scientific visualizations, while spotlights feature a variety of links, news articles, papers, and so forth. Both items are typically written in a more casual style, with only a small amount of text. iSGTW feature articles are typically 500 - 1,500 words, but sometimes run longer. iSGTW coverage attempts to be rigorously neutral, never favoring projects affiliated with its funding source or Advisory Board, and maintaining balance across world regions. <br/><br/>The iSGTW website, re-launched in January 2011, also has a number of new and exciting community service features. Readers can post announcements, advertise jobs, and add events to the calendar and everything appears on the front page. News feeds on related topics also appeal to readers looking for more background. Similarly, the website has basic social networking functionality: visitors can leave comments, share content, create profiles, and blog.<br/><br/>A large proportion of the news stories covering cyberinfrastructure-enabled research do not mention the computational side of the story. By publishing well-written science stories that explain the computational aspects of the research, iSGTW ensures that taxpayers, policy makers, and other interested readers understand the role of cyberinfrastructure in scientific endeavors.<br/><br/>As a long-established publication, iSGTW has earned the trust of a range of audiences. Furthermore, as an international collaboration with the explicit support of diverse cyberinfrastructures (such as the Open Science Grid and XSEDE), iSGTW is better able to maintain impartiality and credibility, as compared to publications from individual institutions. The general public and members of the press are more likely to give weight to the stories iSGTW runs, and news outlets are more likely to pick them up.<br/><br/>This theory is supported by the growing number of journalists subscribing to iSGTW. In the July 2009 reader survey, only 3% of iSGTW readers identified as journalists. In the most recent survey, that rose to 7%. The subscription list currently includes approximately 130 journalists, not counting those affiliated with foreign-language media. Publications represented include The New York Times, NPR, Science/AAAS, and the Washington Post. iSGTW's email subscriber list has grown to approximately 8,180 today. Web readership is split evenly between the US and the EU, with approximately 40% of viewers hailing from each continent. Viewers from the Asia Pacific region constitute another 13%. Four percent are from the Central and South American sub-continents. The remainder are from Western Asia, the Middle East, and Africa."
0.296997,"The nature of high performance computing is undergoing rapid change with the advent of general purpose GPU-accelerated architectures. These changes open new opportunities for scientific discovery at a much reduced capital and energy cost, but to exploit them, new algorithms and methods are required. <br/><br/>This project supports the collaborative development and implementation of GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) codes and innovative algorithms for the numerical simulation of the strong interactions of quarks and gluons, namely quantum chromodynamics (QCD), on a lattice. Specifically, this project supports the development of CUDA (parallel coding model from NVIDIA)-based code modules and OpenMP threading that can be used with the MILC [Multiple Instruction (and Multiple Data) Lattice Calculation] code. This 200,000-line code suite is used by several research groups around the world and supports some 100 million core-hours of computing at NSF and DOE national centers and laboratories mostly on conventional supercomputers. Our code development will allow improved performance on GPU clusters and on computers such as Blue Waters at NCSA that contain both GPUs and conventional multicore processors. Performance models developed will guide the performance tuning and help to plan future calculations and should also be of value in studing the effectiveness of exascale architectures. <br/><br/>Interpretation of many of the experimental results in particle physics is currently limited by lack of theoretical understanding. This reduces our ability to determine parameters of the Standard Model and to find evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model through precision experiments. The calculations that are enabled are thus important for the interpretation of many experiments in elementary particle physics. Some of these experiments at Fermilab, Cornell, and at SLAC have been completed. Others such as in Beijing, Geneva, and Japan are still running. <br/><br/>We have publicized previous work on code development and performance modeling by presentations at appropriate conference and publication. We will continue to do so for the current work in order that others can benefit from our methodology and innovations. The MILC code is widely used in benchmarking by several high-performance computing centers. This in turn has led to several vendors contacting us regarding performance of our code on their current and future chips. Thus, having GPU-accelerated code available in MILC could help in the evaluation of or co-design of future high-performance computing architectures. <br/><br/>Finally this project will contribute to the professional education and training of future scientists via the participation of postdoctoral reseachers."
0.278993,"One of the most enduring mysteries in science is the explanation for the evidence that, on all scales larger than a single star, far more gravitating material is seen to exist than can be accounted for by the atoms in these systems. This material, called Dark Matter (DM), is intrinsically invisible and has only conclusively been seen by its gravitational effects in aggregate. The objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that DM is an exotic particle, constituting about 85% of the mass of the Universe. If DM is observed in this detector, the project would be able to characterize basic properties such as its mass and the strength with which it interacts with ordinary matter.<br/><br/>Many undergraduates have participated in the work at IUSB as have high school teachers and students. They have participated in all aspects of ""big science"" at an undergraduate institution. The group has aided the broader scientific community by fabricating specially designed transducers for a wide array of operating environments. An astrophysics experiment is now using acoustic particle ID in a bubble chamber to study exotic reactions relevant to large stars. The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment uses them to understand electrical breakdown in RF cavities. A competing dark matter experiment uses them to eliminate boiling background. A neutron parity violation spin rotation experiment will use them to understand bubble migration in liquid helium.<br/><br/>This award provides funds to enable the IUSB group to continue to contribute to the detector R&D, installation, commissioning and running of the PICO bubble chambers and analysis of the resulting data. PICO uses superheated liquids to search for the tiny energy depositions left by nuclei recoiling due to collisions with dark matter. These depositions cause the liquid to explosively transform into gas. The bubble chamber technique represents a unique approach in the field, since it is inherently immune to sparsely ionizing particles (such as electrons), which are serious backgrounds to other DM detectors. This will be especially important if robust observation claims are made by experiments in the future. It has also been demonstrated by the group that the target fluids are easily changed, which will be important in determining the properties of any observed DM particle. The IUSB group has designed and fabricated all of the acoustic transducers for the detectors. The group recently discovered that one can even distinguish what kind of nucleus has decayed. IUSB also participates in the commissioning and running of the various bubble chambers at the deep site and energy threshold experiments at the Fermilab test-beam facility. A new design for transducers mounted in the dome over the bellows system will be made for a ton-scale detector. The group will also continue to contribute to the analysis of data already collected with the COUPP-60 and PICO-2L detectors."
0.031442,"The workshop: ""Aging and Failure in Biological, Physical and Engineered Systems"" will take place in May 15-17, 2016 in Cambridge, MA and the participants will discuss the mechanisms by which most complex systems fail. Biological organisms, complex machines, materials, buildings, and social and economic structures loose integrity as they age, and catastrophically fall apart. Failure is investigated by a wide range of highly differentiated disciplines ranging from evolutionary biodemography to solder joint reliability, each of which has established highly differentiated research tracks, specialized language and methodology in order to study one universal phenomenon. The purpose of this meeting is to bring these divergent research tracks together in order to attain a unified view of failure, and point towards a common description. This will be a follow up of the two NSF funded aging workshops that took place for the last two years. Continuing in the tradition of the previous two, we will invite biologists, physicists, medical scientists, and prepare the ground for synergistic discussion. Different from the previous two workshops, we will include reliability engineers and evolutionary biologists. The invited speakers will deliver 20-minute presentations. Since the number of invitees will be few, there will be plenty of time for synergistic interaction: Session chairs will encourage short questions during the presentation and a long discussion that follows every talk, for which we will allocate an extra 20 min. Many students will attend the workshop from different departments and engage in discussions with leading scientists from this interdisciplinary field of research.<br/><br/>Through this workshop the participants will work towards an understanding of the fundamental principles of aging and failure by generalizing the conclusions drawn from specific mechanisms taking place in specific systems. By identifying quantifiable, testable questions on how living and nonliving systems age and fail, by establishing commonalities and differences between engineering, physical, social and biological aging and failure, and by bringing the languages of engineering reliability, aging biology, molecular biophysics and statistical mechanics together (i.e. set up the foundations of a translation table between aging and failure in living, material/physical, social and engineered systems) we will lay forth the state of art theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying aging and failure."
0.691746,"This collaborative award will support formation of a Physics of Living Systems Graduate Student Research Network, a trans-institutional community-based network of graduate students and graduate student educators all working on the physics of living systems. The initial participating institutions are the University of California, San Diego (which will coordinate the program), the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Princeton University, Yale University, Cambridge University, and University College, London. The network structure will allow students at participating institutions (and a select number of other students) to meet their peers (both in-person and in-silico) and collectively help define the research agenda for this field. It will also allow for the creation of visiting internships, which will serve both as a way of broadening students perspectives on possible approaches to difficult research topics and as a way of creating collaborative ties between groups at the various sites. This structure will also enable the exploration of various means of educating these students in biology, while also ensuring that they develop and maintain a firm grounding in physics.

0.474628,"Intellectual Merit VERITAS is currently the most sensitive VHE gamma-ray observatory in the world. Operating at the basecamp of the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona, the VERITAS project expands the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope technique pioneered by its precursor, the Whipple 10m Telescope, to include an array of four 12m telescopes with a multitelescope trigger for an order-of-magnitude improved sensitivity over the previous generation. VERITAS probes the extreme physics of sources such as the jets of Active Galactic Nuclei, Supernovae Remnants, and microquasars and provides an important complement to the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. This award will provide support for the VERITAS science and collaboration service efforts of the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum researchers. The Adler group will lead the development and optimization of advanced gamma-ray analysis methods to increase the performance of VERITAS and play a leading role in calibration efforts. The Adler's science efforts will utilize the improved array performance in the study of extended supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae focusing on the case of the Crab Nebula, particularly in light of the recent discovery of the rapid bright synchrotron flares detected by Fermi. <br/><br/>Broader Impact The Adler serves as the lead institution for VERITAS Education and Outreach efforts. Beyond the management aspects of the VERITAS EPO effort, the Adler VERITAS scientists will engage in a variety of efforts including hosting undergraduate interns from collaborating VERITAS institutions, participating in the daily 'Astronomy Conversations' held at the Adler Planetarium's Space Visualization Laboratory, investigating the feasibility of a Citizen Science project to distinguish gamma rays from cosmic rays, and providing planetarium expertise to the VERITAS project office to develop a VERITAS-themed show."
0.48,"This project will utilize precision frequency comb spectroscopy in the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) to investigate atomic and molecular transitions that have significant value in increasing our understanding of fundamental physics. A new method utilizing two phase-coherent XUV femtosecond frequency combs will be investigated as a promising path towards high-resolution spectroscopy with unprecedented accuracy in this difficult to reach spectral region. The physics to be explored in this project will come from two distinct objectives: (1) to elucidate how the physics underlying intracavity high harmonic generation affects the conversion efficiency and noise characteristics of the XUV femtosecond frequency comb, and (2) to utilize the dual-XUV frequency comb approach to provide an improved measurement of high-n Rydberg states (n~50-60) in molecular hydrogen, thereby providing an improved value for the ionization and dissociation energy of this physically important molecular system.<br/><br/>This program will provide a unique research-based education for graduate students in the fundamentals of light-matter interaction, advanced laser systems, and their use to probe and better understand the most basic and common molecule: molecular hydrogen. Some of the most basic atomic and molecular systems have their first resonance in the vacuum-ultraviolet portion of the light spectrum. This is a region where few laser sources exist, making it difficult to precisely study the structure of atoms and molecules needed for testing our understanding of current physical models. This program will utilize recently developed sources and techniques to study molecular hydrogen with much greater precision, and open the door to further studies in this difficult to reach spectral region. Such research provides a solid foundation to prepare the next generation of scientists to serve in our national, academic, and industrial research laboratories."
2.490049,"Overview: The principal goal of experiments in modern particle physics is to uncover new physics that underlies the Standard Model. Possible approaches include the study of physics processes at the highest available collision energies at accelerators or through studies of the very rare interactions of neutrinos. The Chicago Particle Physics group has been active in both domains. Additionally the group is making significant technological contributions to the development of very fast timing detectors and is advancing a graduate program of accelerator research.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The Chicago group has made major contributions to the development of fast timing detectors for particle physics through the LAPPD (Large Area Picosecond Photodetector) collaboration. Such instrumentation is critical for neutrino and collider experiments described below, and is also important in other fields including applications in medicine and homeland security. The developed technology is now in a phase of transfer to industry.<br/><br/>Additionally the Chicago group has had a very strong program of outreach to the broader community through its major contributions to programs that encourage the participation of underserved students and minorities in science such as the Enrico Fermi Summer Interns Program and their Expanding Your Horizon Program.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: A goal of experiments at the highest available collision energies at the Large Hadron Collider (the LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland is to understand the nature of the Higgs Boson, recently discovered there in 2012, and to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. <br/><br/>These goals are relevant to the understanding of the Universe at its most fundamental level in the fleeting fraction of a second just after the Big Bang, and to why we see the Universe as we do now. To meet the challenges of this quest, new theories are advanced, new detectors and accelerators are developed and built, and new computing and analytical methodologies are created, all of which have significant broader impact for the training of young scientists in the near term and the advancement of technological benefits to society over the longer term. <br/><br/>The next three years represent a transition of the LHC physics program from a collision energy of 8 TeV data-taking and operation, to extended operations and data taking at nearly double the energy, 13-14 TeV. Over a thousand scientists from the United States are involved with this scientific program on several major experiments. <br/><br/>The Chicago group is one of the important groups participating in the ATLAS experiment at CERN. Their contributions include extensive involvement in the technical advancement of the experiment, leading the development of the Fast Track Trigger (the FTK) and the upgrade of the hadron Calorimetry (the TileCAL). The group's principal analytical focus will be Higgs physics, with the Higgs decay mode into b and anti-b quarks. This topology will enable important studies of Higgs properties and searches for new physics using this b - anti b decay as a tool, dark matter searches with heavy quarks, and searches for new physics using di-jet events. These studies will be greatly facilitated by the FTK and/or the TileCAL and by a jet substructure tool which has been developed by the Chicago group for the analysis of the data from first major run of the LHC, and which will be exploited in the upcoming run which begins in 2015.<br/><br/>In Neutrino Physics the Chicago group will be completing its contributions to the reactor-based neutrino experiment called Double Chooz, which will measure the neutrino mixing angle, theta13, with both near and far detectors. Until now, the measurements from Double Chooz were from a single detector only."
0.271649,"Non-technical description:<br/><br/>This grant supports the acquisition of a laser system at Smith College, an undergraduate women's liberal arts college. This system will enable two main developments, the first of which is the next generation of a technique called ""Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA)"" which is expected to significantly improve the ability of the U.S. to monitor activity at known and suspected nuclear reprocessing sites, as well as to analyze ice core samples for climate history studies. The second development involves the measurement of several energy levels of neutral beryllium to high precision, which improves our understanding of atomic theory and helps to advance basic science. <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/><br/>To perform trace analysis with krypton (in support of the first development described in the paragraph above), krypton atoms first need to be transferred to a metastable state for laser cooling and trapping. The precision of most Atom Trap Trace Analysis measurements is currently limited by the methods used to produce the metastable atomic beams. Replacing these methods with the optical source funded here will lead to significant advances such as an increase in detection efficiency, a decrease in sample size, and elimination of cross-sample contamination. The beryllium project (the second development described in the paragraph above) aims to improve experimental measurements on several energy levels and the ionization threshold. Currently, theoretical estimates of the energy levels have more than an order of magnitude more precision than experimental measurements. These improved experimental results will delineate various theoretical models, test quantum electrodynamics, and help determine the nuclear charge radius of beryllium."
3.569903,"Overview: Particle physics considers a vast range of scientific questions, from subatomic to cosmic scales. The Michigan State University (MSU) Group supported through this award investigates such questions through experimentation at the highest available collision energies at accelerators, through studies of the very rare interactions of neutrinos, and through studies of high energy gamma rays produced by astrophysical sources. These studies are relevant to the understanding of the Universe at its most fundamental level in the fleeting fraction of a second just after the Big Bang, and to why we see the Universe as we do now. To meet the challenges of this quest, new theories are advanced, new detectors and accelerators are developed and built, and new computing and analytical methodologies are created, all of which have significant broader impact for the training of young scientists in the near term and the advancement of technological benefits to society over the longer term. A notable element of the MSU Group's outreach activities has been the development of a planetarium show on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that has been well received. ATLAS itself is developing a show on dark matter with MSU leadership and participation. During the funding period covered by this proposal, the group will continue to improve and innovate on similar programs that can be shown nationally, internationally and locally, bringing the excitement of high energy physics to a large variety of audiences.<br/><br/>A goal of experiments at the highest available collision energies at the LHC at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland is to understand the nature of the Higgs Boson, recently discovered there in 2012, and to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model, the current very effective, but not complete, theoretical model that provides insight into much of our present knowledge of particle physics. The next three years represent a transition of the LHC physics program from data taking and operation at a collision energy of eight Teraelectronvolt (TeV) to extended operations and data taking at nearly double the energy, 13-14 TeV. Over a thousand scientists from the United States are involved with this scientific program on several major experiments. <br/><br/>The Michigan State group is one of the important participants in the ATLAS experiment at CERN. Group members hold responsible positions in physics analysis, detector operations, collaboration management, and in the upgrade of the experimental detector. Analytically, the group is focusing on studies of Standard Model physics and beyond the standard model through investigations in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Higgs physics, top quark physics, and searches for new exotic states. The group has also made significant contributions to CTEQ, the Coordinated Theoretical-Experimental QCD project. <br/><br/>The group has a long-standing involvement in neutrino physics, now focused on the NOvA (Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) Off-axis (electron) neutrino Appearance Experiment) experiment and the LArIAT (Liquid Argon in a Testbeam) test program, both associated with Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The nature of neutrino mass and mixing looms as science already beyond the standard model and the NOvA experiment is the next major US-based experiment addressing these issues. Finally, the Michigan State group is a member of the HAWC (High Altitude Water Cerenkov) Experiment located in Mexico. A gamma ray observatory, HAWC will probe extreme environments in the universe, providing a view of non-thermal processes in the galaxy and beyond. The group is focusing its efforts on electronics and database development. Although the detector is not fully instrumented, it is nevertheless taking data."
0.33,"The likely detection of gravitational waves will open a new window for astronomy and provide new tests of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Interpreting the observations will require accurate theoretical gravitational waveforms calculated from the theory. This project will contribute to testing general relativity by solving the equations of motion and wave generation of an important alternative theory, known as scalar-tensor gravity, systematically in a post-Newtonian approximation. The calculated waveforms will be used to assess the bounds on this class of theories that could be achieved by ground-based detectors such as the LIGO-Virgo network. We also will study whether binary black hole systems in these theories are observationally identical to their general relativistic counterparts, extending earlier conjectures by Penrose and Hawking. The possibility of testing general relativity in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy using future infrared telescopes, proposed by the PI in 2008, will be investigated further. The distribution of dark-matter particles very close to the black hole will be determined using a fully general relativistic calculation that extends and corrects earlier approaches. The effects of general relativity on the structure and long-term evolution of clusters of stars around massive black holes will be studied using both analytic means and N-body simulations.<br/><br/>The work on gravitational waves in scalar-tensor theories will impact gravitational-wave observations, as the equations developed in this project will likely be incorporated into the data-analysis pipelines of the detectors. The project on testing general relativity at the galactic center has strong links to many astronomical studies of the center of our galaxy. In the course of this project a post-doctoral researcher and graduate students will learn both the fundamental theory of general relativity, along with many aspects of astrophysics, gravitational-wave detection, and astronomical observations, thereby developing a broad array of tools that they will be able to use in their future careers. Einstein's theory is a topic that fascinates the general public, and the PI will continue to give public lectures on topics related to this research, bringing understanding of Einstein's ideas to the broader community. The PI has also recently completed a major textbook on Newtonian and post-Newtonian gravity (with Eric Poisson), and plans to update his classic review article on experimental gravitation for the web-based journal Living Reviews in Relativity, and to revamp and update his book Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics. He will also be writing a number of specially commissioned review articles celebrating the centenary of general relativity, in 2015."
0.325742,"The ability to observe very low-energy electrons is crucial for the physics reach of the Super-Kamiokande (SK) experiment at the Kamioka mine in Japan. It influences the sensitivity to a wide range of physics topics from solar neutrinos to proton decay to particle identification. This work will develop new software and hardware for a new very low-energy trigger for the SK experiment. In late 2008, all of the electronics and data acquisition components in SK were replaced, leading to an entirely new data-taking approach using real-time software triggers; however, the initial computing and storage capabilities of this system only allow an energy threshold similar to that of the previous system. The Wideband Intelligent Trigger (WIT) system will provide sufficient connectivity, storage, and CPU power to completely process the data in the un-triggered, raw stream and extract electrons with high efficiency down to a total energy of 3 MeV, which is the limit of stable and reliable event reconstruction at SK. It operates by evaluating each data block independently in a massively parallel fashion and applying new software algorithms that culminate in a two-stage vertex reconstruction. This procedure reduces the background, the processing time and the final data size to a manageable level. The new low energy threshold will: (1) improve SK's sensitivity to spectral distortions of solar neutrinos due to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, bringing new sensitivity to to the as-yet-unobserved upturn in the solar neutrino spectrum expected from large mixing angle MSW oscillations; (2) provide new functionality by acting as a galactic supernova burst trigger; and (3) by adding Gadolinium to the water, enable SK to detect neutrons with high efficiency, significantly reducing the atmospheric neutrino background to both the observation of proton decay and relic supernova neutrinos. <br/><br/>The research supported by this award is an example of how advances in computing can extend the capabilities of existing instruments for basic research, effectively extending the physics reach and leveraging existing investments. The Kamioka Laboratory in Japan has an extensive program for involving the public, undergraduate students and K-12 students in the excitement of physics research. The postdoc and graduate student working on WIT will be integrated into these activities and lectures on the physics that comes from looking at low-energy events in Super-Kamiokande. Undergraduate students from the U.S. will work with this group in Japan during the summer for one to two months to help implement WIT and to help analyze the first data. They will maintain a collaborative relationship with faculty at a local undergraduate institution. They will also participate in the effort by attending Super-Kamiokande collaboration meetings, taking shifts at the experiment and participating in the scientific research."
0.45,"Plasmas constitute over 99% of the visible universe and turbulent mixing of plasmas is a fundamental process that is important both in natural and artificial situations. Turbulent mixing of ionized gas, called plasma, is especially fascinating when the plasma is embedded inside a strong magnetic force field. Mixing of magnetized plasma has special geometric relationships, couples energy from small and large sized vortex-like structures know as ""eddies,"" and creates self-organization through a remarkable turbulent ""pinch."" A collaboration between two universities will operate two unique facilities, called laboratory magnetospheres, that contain high-temperature ionized gas using a magnetic force field that resembles the field that surround our Earth and other planets. New measurements will be combined with new theories and simulations that will answer unresolved questions including: How do plasma eddies couple energy at different sizes? How do plasmas evolve during turbulent mixing? What mechanisms cause turbulent self-organization? New science will advance including: (1) global imaging and control of turbulent interchange mixing in a variety of plasma conditions, (2) study of electrostatic self-organization through the understanding of the turbulent pinch, and (3) validating our models for lowfrequency turbulence by carrying out self-consistent nonlinear simulations of turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres.<br/><br/>This research has broad impact because turbulent mixing of magnetized plasma is ubiquitous and fundamental. Understanding turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres will improve our understanding of (1) processes occurring in the ionosphere, which is important to satellite communication, (2) turbulence inside the central regions of planetary magnetospheres, which is important to space weather models, and (3) the anisotropic mixing of low-dimensional fluid systems, which is important to industrial processes. Additionally, this collaborative research uses state-of-the-art facilities at highly-regarded research universities to motivate students and scientists to explore plasma dynamics in a magnetic configuration that resembles a magnetosphere and to encourage the next generation of scientists able to understand and control high-temperature, ionized matter."
0.17201,"This award is part of the NSF effort to promote significant advances in the fundamental understanding of cancer biology made possible through multidisciplinary research that involves experts in theoretical physics, applied mathematics, and computer science.<br/><br/>The last two decades have seen the development of increasingly effective cancer therapies that target different facets of transformed cells, including aberrant proliferation/survival, immune evasion, hyper-activated signaling pathways and dysregulated transcriptional programs. In a subset of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small cell lung cancer with specific mutations, these therapies lead to dramatic clinical responses in a significant proportion of patients. However, in the majority of AML and subset of lung cancer patients who respond to anti-cancer therapies, therapeutic relapse subsequently ensues, although often after a considerable interval, such that these responses do not lead to long-term cures. In this project the PIs will use theoretical physics and mathematical modeling approaches to investigate the process of response to treatment, the basis for persistence of a subset of cells during clinical response, and the mechanisms driving subsequent therapeutic relapse in these two tumor types. This integrative approach will involve genomic, transcriptional, and phenotypic assays of tumors at the various stages of therapeutic response and resistance. As such, this project is expected to lead to a more fundamental understanding of the evolution of drug resistance and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed to prevent the emergence of clinical resistance. Although the efforts in this project will focus on lung cancer and AML, the results and approaches described herein will have broader relevance to oncology and are aimed to uncover general principles and models, which are relevant to the spectrum of human cancers. <br/><br/>The integrative approach in this project will lead to major advances in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic evolution of cancer. The studies into the genetic and mechanistic basis for therapeutic relapse, and the detailed genetic, epigenetic, and functional studies of EGFR mutant lung cancer and AML patient samples before therapy, at the time of maximal clinical response, and at disease relapse will allow the PIs to obtain detailed datasets from DNA sequencing and gene expression profiling to probe the dynamics of the genetic and epigenetic diversity at different phases of disease. In turn, this will guide the development of quantitative models of the evolutionary processes that can then be tested in the laboratory. The interplay between the modeling and data will guide strategies for future data collection and in vitro experiments to functionally test hypotheses that emanate from the modeling studies."
0.2,"This award is part of the NSF effort to promote significant advances in the fundamental understanding of cancer biology made possible through multidisciplinary research that involves experts in theoretical physics, applied mathematics, and computer science.<br/><br/>Achieving durable control of metastatic solid tumors will require high-order targeted therapeutic combinations, because single-agent therapeutics eventually become thwarted by the development of tumor drug resistance. However, design of combinatorial regimens cannot be done by empirical trial and error in the clinical setting. The goal of the project is to blend a systems biology network-based theoretical framework with an integrated experimental and analytical program in order to address the combinatorial regimen challenge in oncology. Based on areas of exemplary clinical need, investigator expertise, and the availability of patient-derived tumor tissue, the project will focus on BRAF-mutant melanoma and PIK3CA-mutant, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer as initial tumor types in which to pilot the approach. In addition the project will offer interdisciplinary training and research experience to postdoctoral and clinical fellows, graduate students, and indirectly to all members of the groups who participate. Professional development of all trainees will be enhanced by yearly meetings of the whole project team which will include tutorials on modeling and experimental methodologies. A symposium on the quantitative science of cancer will be organized at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute during the third year of this project. Team members are also committed to broadening the participation of women and under-represented minorities in STEM fields by pro-active recruitment and mentoring.<br/><br/>The project will integrate dynamic modeling of signal transduction pathways relevant to cell proliferation and apoptosis, genomic and evolutionary analyses of tumor cells, and systematic cell death and therapeutic resistance studies. The dynamic models will be informed, tested, and iterated using experimental approaches applied to relevant cancer model systems. The experiments leverage emerging technologies such as pooled genome-wide open reading frame screens, dynamic BH3 profiling of cancer cells' closeness to the apoptotic threshold, whole exome sequencing and single cell RNA-seq analysis. The models will recapitulate steady state signaling network activation, acute adaptive effects of treatment (e.g., feedback dysregulation) and the range of drug-resistant states that may emerge following longer-term drug exposure. Tumor cell heterogeneity will be represented by the implementation of different initial configurations or state overrides of network components. Using newly developed systems control methodologies, the models will be used to prioritize drug combinations and dosing/scheduling principles for in vitro and in vivo testing. The final result will be a theoretical and experimentally validated approach that can be generalized across many other cancer types. This project develops a new framework to address cancer as a deregulated complex dynamical system and it will lead to an improved understanding of adaptive and acquired drug resistance mechanisms. The project will make a significant contribution toward a major goal of cancer precision medicine, namely the identification of optimal high-order combinations for individual cancer patients. The project will also establish new connections between evolutionary theory and dynamical systems theory. The theoretical and methodological advances will be applicable or adaptable to other cancers and diseases in general, leading to potentially transformative impacts on human health. <br/><br/>This proposal is cofunded by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division."

0.27,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Vilenkin at Tufts University.<br/><br/>The theory of cosmic inflation, which was proposed as a speculative hypothesis 35 years ago, has by now accumulated substantial observational support and has become the leading cosmological paradigm. This theory has also led to a major change in our global view of the universe. According to the new worldview, much of the volume in the universe is in the state of explosive inflationary expansion. We live in a ""bubble"" where inflation has ended, but it will never end in the entire universe. The total volume of inflating regions continues to grow, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed. The major goal of the proposed research is to learn how this ""multiverse"" scenario can be tested observationally and to investigate its implications for the beginning of the universe. The multiverse worldview has far-reaching implications beyond physics. It provides a dramatically new perspective on the global structure of the universe and on our place in it. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the understanding of the properties of the universe. Professor Vilenkin will also involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. He will continue his efforts to communicate the ideas of modern cosmology to the general public, in the form of public lectures, popular articles, and interviews for radio and TV. He will also write a textbook, emphasizing the new worldview, based on his undergraduate cosmology course, which is aimed at students with no preparation in science.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Vilenkin will investigate the possibility of a direct test of the multiverse scenario by observing collisions of our bubble with other bubbles, or with topological defects that could nucleate in the inflating background. Possible observational effects of such collisions will be studied using both analytic and numerical methods. A complementary approach is to analyze the statistical properties of the multiverse and use them to derive predictions for the observed values of the constants of Nature in our bubble. This approach will be pursued, with the main focus on the statistics of different states in the multiverse and of the transition rates between them. The general problem of making predictions in the multiverse, known as the measure problem, will also be addressed."
0.34,"This award funds the research activities of Professors R. Sekhar Chivukula and Elizabeth H. Simmons at Michigan State University.<br/><br/>The research funded under this grant focuses on uncovering the origins of the masses of the elementary subatomic particles. The next three years will coincide with the 13-TeV high-energy run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, which will reveal the properties of the newly discovered 126-GeV ""Higgs"" boson, perform detailed studies of the top quark (the heaviest elementary particle known), and investigate the nature of matter down to the smallest distance scales ever probed. In their research, Professors Chivukula and Simmons will perform theoretical investigations to model the behavior of matter at these short distance scales and predict new phenomena that could be observed at the LHC. This research is in the national interest because it will promote the progress of science in helping to elucidate the fundamental laws governing our universe and deepen our knowledge of the subatomic realm. The proposed project also has several broader impacts. Professors Chivukula and Simmons are leaders in campus and national efforts to improve students' learning and persistence in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), especially first-generation students and those from under-represented populations. The PIs will also involve graduate students and postdocs in their research, providing training to junior physicists in research methods and professional preparation to become independent scientists. Finally, the PIs will continue presenting the results of their research in outreach events focused on students from groups underrepresented in science, in order to engage the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>More technically, Professors Chivukula and Simmons will investigate how electroweak symmetry breaking and the origins of particle masses are impacted by relationships between the Higgs, top quark, and QCD sectors of theories beyond the Standard Model. The PIs will construct and study models in which the Higgs is composite, including those where the top plays a special role in electroweak symmetry breaking and may also be composite. They will derive constraints on these theories from flavor physics and precision electroweak data, emphasizing the phenomenological consequences of the models for the new scalar and other states that may appear at the LHC and future colliders. Professors Chivukula and Simmons will also study models of an extended color sector featuring new colored vector, scalar, or fermion states. The high-energy LHC will dramatically extend our experimental reach for new colored states, and the PIs will systematically investigate how to determine the properties of such a state upon discovery."
0.304897,"There is strong cosmological and astrophysical evidence for non-baryonic, cold dark matter as a major constituent of the universe. The nature of Dark Matter, so far elusive, constitutes one of the most fundamental questions in science. Its discovery as a yet unknown particle would have profound implications in our understanding of the universe, and open new directions in particle physics and cosmology. A compelling explanation for what might constitute dark matter is the existence of hitherto unknown Weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), and a world-wide experimental effort is on-going to test this hypothesis. This project is part of that effort. <br/><br/>Immersive research experiences developed in collaboration with programs focused on underrepresented groups will enhance diversity at the graduate and undergrad levels. Innovative partnerships with Adler Planetarium and the School of the Art Institute in Chicago (SAIC) will bring Dark Matter science to broad and diverse audiences. Visitor experiences at the Adler Planetarium (450,000 visitors/year) will be enhanced by the participation of DAMIC scientists and the integration of visualizations of particle interactions with charge-coupled devices (CCDs). In collaboration with SAIC, an advanced STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) program will inspire art students as well as experienced professionals (e.g. designers) via explorations of software and modeling tools to display current scientific data.<br/><br/>The Dark Matter In CCDs (DAMIC) experiment searches for low mass WIMPs with scientific-grade silicon CCDs. With this novel technique, WIMP-induced signals are detected with an unprecedented low energy threshold, and unique spatial resolution. DAMIC-100, to be installed in 2015 at the SNOLAB underground laboratory in Sudbury, Canada, will have an active detector mass of 100 g. This award provides support for the participation of the U. Chicago group to DAMIC-100. They have played a major role in the DAMIC R&D phase and in the construction of the 100 g detector. The group will have strong responsibilities in the test and calibration of the CCDs, in the installation and commissioning of the experiment, and in the data analysis. In addition, a calibration of the nuclear recoil energy scale will be performed at U. Chicago with a neutron source."
0.462454,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model has succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date has been recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions, for example why there is a preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to such open questions about the universe is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are elementary particles that barely interact with anything else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they would undergo whenever they would interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino measurements, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. There have also been possible hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos (called sterile neutrinos), and building the critical instruments to clarify such ""hints"" is one of the main thrusts of the work in this project.<br/><br/>The work proposed here is to develop the front-end electronics for a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) for the Liquid Argon, Near Detector (LAr1-ND) Experiment. This detector technique is powerful in that it allows the experimenter to distinguish between electrons and photons, important for the understanding of the character of neutrino interactions and neutrino oscillations. At Fermilab, the LAr1-ND experiment, along with a companion experiment called MicroBooNE, should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether hypothesized ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments. The electronics developed through this award will also advance an important new technology for the field, the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber, which is the likely technology in the future large-scale Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) being constructed at FNAL."
0.27,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Matthew B. Kleban at New York University.<br/><br/>Some contemporary theories of fundamental physics predict the existence of a so-called ""multiverse"" containing many distinct bubble universes. These bubbles collide, and collisions with our own bubble produce ""cosmic wakes"" that travel across our universe, creating specific patterns that are potentially observable with cosmological data from satellite- and ground-based observatories. The detection of such a collision would be a transformative discovery, demonstrating that our observable universe is a tiny part of a vastly larger whole populated by bubbles containing regions of highly exotic physics. It would confirm a prediction of string theory, provide crucial evidence for the nature of ""dark energy"", and permanently alter our view of the big bang. Professor Kleban will advance a program of research focused on those aspects of string theory and quantum gravity that predict effects --- like bubble collisions --- that can be tested with cosmological observations. Professor Kleban's ongoing research seeks to determine the microphysical origin of cosmic inflation, a period of explosive expansion that took place in the very early universe. As such, Professor Kleban's research advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. Professor Kleban's work will also continue to have broader impact in the form of public lectures and interviews, and in inspiring undergraduate and graduate physics students at NYU. On another front, Prof. Kleban will also train and assist in the professional development of a postdoctoral researcher who will participate in this project.<br/><br/>More technically, Prof. Kleban will attempt to realize a model known as ""unwinding inflation"" in a consistent, stabilized string theory compactification. This model has a number of notable advantages that might make it a plausible explanation for inflation, particularly the fact that it begins spontaneously from a generic meta-stable de Sitter phase in the string landscape. He will also continue his work on inflationary signatures of bubble collisions, tunneling, and other initial-state effects, as well as dynamical features produced during inflation that might indicate its microphysical origin. Lastly, he will continue to study string theory in strongly time-dependent settings, such as cosmology and relativistic brane scattering."

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. One technique for exploring physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is in making precision measurements of SM model atomic parameters such as the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. This award will develop the accelerator technology necessary for such a precision measurement of the neutron EDM. This project is to explore essential tools for exploration of physics beyond Standard model of particle physics. Tools for this exploration include a neutron beam storage ring, polarized proton beams and high power beams. Besides the basic physics, high power beams can be important to ""nuclear waste"" incineration, which can be important to national security.<br/><br/>This award will allow the study of synchro-betatron coupling of polarized beams relevant to the measurement of EDM, continuing exploration of a neutron beam storage ring, and envelope dynamics of high power proton accelerators. The group will study spin dynamics and synchrotron-betatron coupling of all electric rings that are relevant to polarized beams and will continue to study the neutron beam storage ring. The longitudinal focusing of longitudinal phase space has been explored. The transverse dynamics in using periodic quadrupole and sextupole magnets will be explored to fulfill the initial design of a storage ring. TEST beam experiments will be carried out to test numerical simulations for high power beams."
0.81318,"This award will support a group of four highly experienced PI's to work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, the European particle physics laboratory. The LHC machine and ATLAS detector were built using funds from the NSF and from other agencies around the world. It proved its worth three years ago when scientists discovered the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the known matter in the universe. In spite of its success, the Standard Model still leaves a number of questions about the fundamental structure of the universe unanswered, giving rise to research exploring Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This award will allow the PI's to continue their leading role in studies of the Higgs width and couplings, properties that have so far established it as the SM object anticipated. It will also support their continuing search for BSM that could materialize at the higher energy experiments that are currently underway. <br/><br/>The group supports a vigorous broader impact program. The centerpiece of this is a large, modular, multi-panel exhibit of ATLAS and the LHC. This has been used at major science festivals in NYC and Washington DC, and will be sent to other festivals around the country. They also plan to continue their leadership role in the ATLAS Zooniverse project, which allows the public to view and analyze ATLAS events. <br/><br/>This project will be leveraged by the group's expertise in the operations of the ATLAS trigger, responsible for selection of the interesting reactions that occur in ATLAS. This becomes increasingly key to the physics potential of the LHC in Run2. In this run the LHC will operate at 13 TeV, almost double its currently highest energy of 8 TeV. In addition to conventional approaches to the trigger, and to enhancing sensitivity to new physics, the group will attempt prototyping new strategies such as ""data scouting"" that can fill holes in traditional off-line data analysis pipelines. They will also work on including the transverse momentum trigger, the trigger menu, trigger software, statistical methods and tools, analysis tools, pileup simulation techniques, and event visualization tools. They also plan detailed study of silicon detector properties using the infrastructure they have developed for the ATLAS upgrade."
0.28,"This award will provide support for a group with one PI, a postdoc and a student to work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC is a large, complex machine that accelerates protons to unprecedented energies, allowing for discovery of elementary particles more massive than any yet observed. One of the LHC's recent discoveries was to find a candidate for the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts with amazing accuracy for the observed interactions of particles forming the visible matter in the universe. The next step is to capitalize on the LHC to look for evidence for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) to address difficulties known to exist in the SM. This group will continue to work on the ATLAS experiment to look for decays of the Higgs particle as the LHC begins operations at twice the energy ever studied before. The PI will continue to communicate the excitement that the Higgs discovery generated as a means of attracting students into the study of science through such activities as giving lectures on Physics at the LHC to high school students in Albany and the Honors College students at the university, organizing and holding Q&A sessions after the screening of the movie ""Particle Fever"" in local area theaters, and participating in the online ""Adopt-a-Physicist"" program run by the American Physical Society.<br/><br/>The LHC has completed one successful run. During this, a candidate for the Higgs Boson was found, a major triumph. Though doubts linger, many physicists believe the new particle is the Higgs Boson long predicted by the SM. Nevertheless, more careful measurements of its rarer decay modes need to be made. Surprises are possible, and could result from BSM effects. Also, there could be more than one Higgs particle. This group has expertise in analysis of the properties of Higgs decays. The group will continue to work on the ATLAS experiment through Run2. Analyses will focus on decays of the Higgs particle revealed in Run1 to t-tbar quark jet pairs. The group will continue to improve and expand the software tools. They will also study layout designs for the inner Silicon tracker, part of the ATLAS high luminosity upgrade. These layouts will aim to maximize the efficiency for finding and reconstructing charged tracks in the challenging ATLAS upgrade environment."
0.16,"Self-organization occurs in many complex living and non-living systems. It is a great challenge to understand the basic principles of self-organization in these systems and to distinguish phenomena in living systems that is shared with non-living systems from phenomena that is generic only to living systems. The PIs in this project will compare self-organization in granular and soft matter systems to self-organization in a yeast cell population. Both systems seem to share common principles of self-organization and the PIs will uncover the basic principles of self-organization of yeast by comparing to the detailed knowledge that exists of self-organization in granular materials. The PIs will engage students to participate in computer simulations and train them in dynamical systems theory and its diverse applications.<br/><br/>In particular the PIs will study population dynamics combining experiments, computations and theory. On the experimental side, the program is focused on three important aspects: First, the PIs will measure the response of populations to genome rewiring. Genome-rewiring is a perturbation exposing the complex cellular dynamics beyond the specific fast relaxing responses observed under more standard perturbations. Second, the PIs will measure the dynamics under controlled conditions, at high temporal resolution over many cell generations covering the wide dynamic range characterizing gene interactions and other intracellular processes as well as population processes such as adaptation. Third, the PIs will study the dynamic coupling between the population and the environment. Their computational efforts will concentrate on constructing a unique framework for population dynamics based on cellular random organization, connecting the intracellular complex dynamics with population processes."

Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCS), the theory describing the forces acting within atomic nuclei, predicts that at sufficiently high temperatures and/or densities, matter should undergo a transition from the standard hadronic phase to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons (Quark Gluon Plasma, QGP). According to our cosmological models, this transition took place in the early universe at about 10 microseconds after the Big Bang. The scientific scope of this field has broadened significantly with new measurements and theoretical developments. The discussions in this workshop will include an interdisciplinary combination of concepts from elementary-particle physics, nuclear physics, QCD thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, and non-equilibrium transport theory. Attendance at the workshop will enhance the scientific communication among the junior members, particularly graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, both from experiment and theory."
1.793205,"It is now a well established fact that the proton and neutron are made from constituents known as quarks and gluons. The research supported by this award investigates how a property of the proton called spin is distributed among its parts. The goal is to extract the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton and compare this with theoretical predictions. The group will also search for indications that strongly interacting matter is expected based on symmetry principles. For example, interactions of neutrinos with nuclei is important for the understanding of supernova explosions. In addition, this group will measure the lifetime of the free neutron, since this is important input to test the Big Bang theory of element creation.<br/><br/>More specifically, the research supported by this award investigates: (1) How the spin of the proton is distributed among its parts. Particles emitted when high-energy beams of spin-aligned protons collide in the STAR detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider can reveal how much of the proton's spin is carried by its gluons or by different types of quarks and anti-quarks. The group will search for the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton and explore spin differences among antiquarks. They will also measure how polarized quarks turn into mesons and baryons and search for indications that strongly interacting matter breaks mirror symmetry;(2) The properties and interactions of neutrinos in nuclei with a large number of neutrons and protons: this is important for the understanding of supernova explosions; (3) How long the free neutron lives: this is important input to test the Big Bang theory of element creation; and (4) whether or not neutrons possess exotic interactions that are not (yet) a part of our current list of forces.<br/><br/>The research activities of the group will contribute toward educating the next generation of skilled PhD scientists for jobs in research and teaching universities, industry and national labs, and medical and computer technology. The investigators co-organize and lecture at summer schools. They participate in the NSF REU program. They mentor their postdocs to facilitate their future entry into teaching and research institutions and the scientific community. They develop undergraduate laboratories emphasizing nuclear technology, bring undergraduates on field trips and assist with programs that encourage pre-college participation in the Indiana University science curriculum. They engage bright young undergraduates in science through jobs or projects, which develop the research skills they will need for success in graduate school. They reach out to the local community through a variety of activities to awaken the interest of students in the local public school system by visiting local high school science classes, acting as judges in local science fairs and for the State Science Olympiad, and presenting physics demonstrations at the Indiana State Fair. They actively recruit female and minority applicants for positions at all levels within the group and the physics department by serving on selection committees for faculty searches and research fellowships for women. They work to make their activities known to the public at large through laboratory tours and Open House presentations, science cafe discussions, radio interviews, and press releases in the local media."
0.374152,"The origin of matter is one of the great puzzles of nature. Even though the visible component is only a small part of the mass/energy balance of the universe the strong force that permanently confines quarks and gluons to atomic nuclei remains mysterious. Understanding of the phenomenon of confinement is one of the fundamental questions in physics. Protons, neutrons and other hadrons are the bound states of quarks and gluons allowed by confinement. This project will pursue studies of individual hadrons and their interaction and is expected to offer a unique window into this fundamental phenomenon. In the process, this project will enable best practice spectroscopy analysis across a broad range of forthcoming experiments, particularly at the Jefferson Laboratory. Education activities are an integral part of this effort. Students will have ample training opportunities and will acquire computational and analytical skills that will serve them well in their future careers in the industry or academia. A vibrant set of summer undergraduate research experiences will be hosted by the investigators at the Jefferson Laboratory with both computer science and particle physics projects.<br/><br/>Developments in particle accelerators and detection techniques have led to a new generation of experiments in hadron physics that are flourishing around the world. An important set of experiments studies hadron spectroscopy, what hadrons exist and with what properties. The new experiments at these facilities generate complicated data sets, which demand a qualitatively new level of sophistication in analysis never achieved before. The objective of the project is to develop new theoretical tools and underlying computational services for analysis of large statistics data sets from current and future experiments in hadron spectroscopy with the goal to search for new hadrons, in particular the so called, hybrids and glueballs, which are expected to carry some unique signatures of the confinement phenomenon. The unique features of the underlying theory of strong interactions also make it an attractive template for constructing theories beyond the Standard Model of fundamental interaction. This project will enable such work."
0.512332,"This work seeks to address the following basic questions. What are the forces acting in nature and what are their properties? How do systems consisting of several objects develop under the influence of these forces? The second question represents one of the most fundamental, unsolved problems in science. The motion of two objects can often be predicted with virtual certainty. For example, if the solar system consisted of only the sun and the earth, one could predict the position and the velocity of the earth relative to the sun for all times in the future. But if only one more object is added to the system (say the moon in the above example) no analytic solution (one that is given in terms of equations) within our mathematical framework exists. This dilemma is known as the few-body problem (FBP). It has very broad impacts in all of the natural sciences because most of modern research deals with systems containing more than 2 objects. The project outlined in this proposal experimentally studies the FBP for atomic systems. For such systems of microscopic scale the FBP is further complicated by the characteristics of quantum-mechanics, the theory that was designed to describe such tiny systems. In the long term, this work may influence not only the understanding of isolated atoms, but also the interaction of beams of atoms (or ions or molecules) with surfaces, something which is a key technology underpinning the manufacturing of portable electronic devices and computers.<br/><br/>In this project the few-body problem will be studied by performing kinematically complete experiments on ionization of simple targets by ion impact. The momentum vectors of the scattered projectiles and of the recoiling target ions are measured directly and the momentum of the ejected electron is deduced from the kinematic conservation laws. From the data, fully differential cross sections (FDCS) will be extracted. The coherence properties of the projectile can be varied by changing the geometry of a collimating slit placed before the target. Only relatively recently it was discovered that the FDCS can be sensitive to the projectile coherence length. This, in turn, can explain very puzzling discrepancies between theory and experiment, which were vividly debated for the last decade. The proposed work aims at systematically exploring the role of the projectile coherence properties in atomic few-body systems. It is anticipated that the results from these studies will represent an important step forward towards a thorough understanding of the few-body problem."
0.35,"Neutron capture in stars leading to the formation of heavy elements, as well as nucleon induced fission, are at the forefront of nuclear physics research. Because the neutron lacks charge, reactions with free neutrons are very difficult, and popular tools such as deuteron stripping (d,p) reactions are often used instead. The neutron inside the deuteron is bound and its energy, momentum, and angular momentum do not directly relate to the same quantities for a free neutron. Hence, the development of advanced (d,p) theory is critical for the success of many experimental programs at existing and future radioactive beam facilities. The overarching objective of this project is to advance the theory of deuteron stripping reactions leading to bound states and resonances, providing reliable connections between (d,p) reaction cross sections and the corresponding (direct or resonant) neutron capture cross sections on unstable nuclei. In this project the investigators will develop publicly available computer codes that will aid in the interpretation of low-energy experiments at radioactive beam facilities.<br/><br/>Simple transfer reactions such as deuteron stripping (d,p) reactions carry many of the basic features of rearrangement reactions induced by heavier nuclei. They provide a unique tool for extracting nuclear information for neutron capture identified as one of the crucial inputs needed for nuclear astrophysics and applied physics studies, such as in advanced fuel cycles, nuclear energy and nuclear safety applications, and nuclear stockpile stewardship. Advanced reaction theory is the key to connecting (d,p) cross sections to neutron capture cross sections. This project is devoted to advancing low-energy reaction theory. The investigators will focus on obtaining accurate solutions of the generalized three-body Faddeev integral equations including explicitly the Coulomb interaction between nuclei. This project will provide training opportunities for students, who will have the chance to work on cutting-edge theoretical and computational developments of great importance for the future of nuclear physics."

The REU site will focus on interactions of laser light with matter at atomic and nanoscales, as well as investigations of neutrinos and elementary particle collisions and probing how students learn physics. The experience of what real science is like helps the participants make better informed decisions about careers, graduate work and/or professional school. Whether they choose to continue in physics or a related technical field, or choose to move to a different area, bright students making good choices early in their careers is in the national interest.<br/><br/>Undergraduate student participants will do research on how atoms and molecules behave in intense and ultra-fast optical and x-ray pulses, precision spectroscopy in laser-cooled atoms, how light interacts non-linearly in optical fibers, the properties of nanoparticles in solution, and protein self-assembly with simplified models. They will help build next-generation hardware for high-energy particle detection, improve measurements of neutrino oscillations, and help faculty use research-based assessment tools. This experience will be supplemented by a series of lectures that provide the background these students need to carry out their projects. The participants will gain experience in explaining their research work to a variety of audiences and will also read about and discuss ethical behavior in science."
0.629398,"Positrons, a form of antimatter, are the antiparticles of electrons. While our world is almost solely composed of matter, it is not understood why. Positrons (antiparticles) can be created using a variety of techniques, however, and they are important in a number of applications. One example is in medicine and drug design, where positron emission tomography (PET) is used to study metabolic processes. Positrons are also used to study and develop new materials, to form antihydrogen (stable neutral antimatter), and to understand a variety of astrophysical processes. This research seeks to establish a fundamental understanding of the interaction of positrons with ordinary matter, particularly in the form of molecules, which can be used to further these applications and to develop new ones. The project is also an excellent training ground for scientific and technical personnel; it involves student and post-doctoral researchers at all levels, from the planning of experiments to the dissemination of research results. <br/><br/>This project focuses on studies of the interaction of low-energy positrons with atoms and molecules. Of interest is the excitation of vibrational Feshbach resonances, a process in which a positron, in collision with a molecule, excites a vibrational mode and becomes trapped on the molecule. A particular focus of the research is the understanding of the observed enhancements in annihilation rates as a function of incident positron energy and using these spectra to determine positron-molecule binding energies. Fundamental aspects of atomic physics involved in this research include understanding electron-positron correlations, positron binding to atoms and molecules, and the nature of the resonances in positron annihilation resulting from positron attachment. A new cold beam will allow studies of the role of vibrational-mode symmetry in determining the strengths of the annihilation resonances. Other research goals include understanding quantitatively the annihilation of positrons on molecules when intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) is operative. These positron-IVR studies could potentially provide new insights into molecular dynamics, complementary to studies now done by the chemistry and biology communities using optical techniques."
0.379448,"In this project the PIs will develop a theoretical framework to understand information processing in brain networks. The theoretical developments will be tested with experiments done in the collaborating lab of Canals (Alicante) by observation of the hemodynamic and electrical neural activity in animal with micro-electric stimulation in in-vivo animal experiments. A vast corpus of theoretical analysis and experimental data will serve to analyze the brain as a network of networks. This will involve a novel theoretical framework conceived to robustly determine how modules dynamically form and share information at different scales. The network analysis will reveal the brain nodes that are essential to control brain functionality in terms of super-spreaders and super-inhibitor nodes, cascading effects, robustness and vulnerability to node failure. The mathematical framework of the PIs challenges current thinking regarding the functional structure of the brain as a small-world and scale-free network, which is defined by short paths, large local clustering and a single degree distribution. Small-world networks have been proposed to solve a basic conundrum: the brain needs to form modules which ought to be sufficiently independent to guarantee functional specialization and sufficiently connected to bind multiple processors for efficient information transfer. However, this structure presents an intrinsic tension between shortcuts generating small-worlds and the persistence of modularity; a global property unrelated to local clustering. In this project the PIs depart from the current thinking in brain functional structure, replacing the concept of small-world by that of hierarchical Networks of Networks that describes the brain as a set of hierarchical modules made of weak/strong links. The broader significance of the proposed theory for the large-scale organization of the brain extends the mathematical theory of networks to radically novel information processing systems. The findings from this research will have implications, not only for systems neuroscience, but also for a number of complex systems ranging from technological, social to biological networks. This proposal represents a symbiosis between the labs of two physicists with expertise in statistical physics and complex networks and a neuroscientist. Such a setting will provide interdisciplinary and international opportunities to students involved in this project. Further broader educational impacts include involvement of underrepresented minority students from CCNY and curriculum development."
0.44,"While typical nuclear excitation energies are in the keV to MeV range, there are several exceptional cases where the excitation energies are much lower. The subject of this project is the thorium-229 isotope, which, uniquely, has an excited state in the UV optical spectrum. Several experimental searches for optical emission in this range undertaken in the past ten years were unsuccessful or inconclusive. In addition to searching in the wrong energy region, the searches were challenged by the narrow linewidth of the nuclear transition. In this work, an alternative electron-bridge transition will be employed for the initial laser excitation of the nuclear isomer level in thorium-229. The nuclear transition is likely to be exceptionally sensitive to the variation of fundamental constants, due to the interplay of the strong and electroweak interactions inside this nucleus. After the isomer level is found, the sensitivity of the nuclear transition to time variation of the fine structure constant will be determined.<br/><br/>This research will have broad impact across several areas of physics and technology. Laser excitation and coherent manipulation of nuclear states would establish a new bridge between atomic and nuclear physics, with the promise of new levels of accuracy for frequency metrology. The project will involve extensive graduate and undergraduate student training and participation."
0.076698,"This award is designated as a Global Venture Fund Award and is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering. The detection of gravitational waves, either on Earth or in space, will open a new window on the universe, requiring extremely sophisticated techniques in experiment and analysis, large facilities, significant manpower and extensive international collaboration. Likely sources of these waves include binary systems of black holes and neutron stars, and solar mass objects spiralling into supermassive black holes. Comparison of the observed gravitational-wave signal with theoretical predictions will enable both the estimation of key astrophysical and cosmological parameters as well as tests of Einstein's general theory of relativity. This project will contribute to the development of gravitational-wave astronomy by enabling more effective collaborations between the PIs and their students and post-docs at the University of Florida (UF) and Dr. Luc Blanchet and his group at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (IAP). The detailed comparison between two different approaches to deriving the motion of small compact bodies orbiting massive compact bodies will be extended to higher orders in the relevant approximation. These comparisons will lead to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of inspiral and merger of compact bodies. Calculations of the motion and gravitational-wave emission of binary compact bodies to high orders in the post-Newtonian approximation will be extended to alternative theories of gravity. In the UF group, Will is a leading expert in testing alternative theories and post-Newtonian theory, complementing Blanchet's expertise. We will extend a theorem by Stephen Hawking on isolated black holes in the Brans-Dicke alternative theory to the more complicated case of two black holes in a circular orbit. This will take advantage of recent work by Blanchet and Whiting in their collaboration on laws of binary black hole mechanics in general relativity.<br/><br/>This work will impact gravitational-wave observations, as the equations developed in this project will be critical in the development of data-analysis algorithms for the detectors. Education and training will be integrated into the research program. Graduate students and post-docs will have the opportunity to travel to the partner institution for extended periods of intensive collaboration. The proposed research will have a broad impact upon our understanding of the applications of General Relativity to extreme astrophysical systems, upon science education, and upon understanding and appreciation of science by the public."
0.150001,"Multi-Scale Approach for the Comprehensive Modeling and Simulation of Non-Equilibrium Atmospheric-Pressure Turbulent Plasma Flows<br/><br/>The project will explore the novel use of Variational Multi-Scale Large Eddy Simulation (VMS-LES) as a consistent, complete, and computationally feasible, modeling and simulation approach for turbulent plasma flows. Three main tasks will be pursued: (i) formulation of a VMS-LES model of plasma flows based on a monolithic treatment of fluid conservation and electromagnetic field evolution equations, together with a novel description of the small scales (computationally unresolvable flow features); (ii) implementation of the model within a software infrastructure for the simulation of industrially-relevant non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasma flows; and (iii) validation of the approach with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of model problems and with experimental data from collaborators from the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. The comprehensiveness of the VMS-LES approach will allow the seamless exploration of laminar, transitional, and turbulent non-equilibrium plasma flow regimes. The monolithic formulation is expected to provide increased robustness and computational efficiency with respect to prevailing solution methods. The project will test the hypothesis of the universality of the small scales, at the core of LES approaches, which will lead to broader understanding of the physics of plasma turbulence and to increased predictive capabilities of turbulence models.<br/><br/>The project will impact diverse modern technologies based on non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasma flows, such as fuel reforming, assisted combustion, gasification, toxics remediation, and materials processing, for which no comprehensive turbulence modeling and simulation methodology exist. The project has the potential to impact a wide range of subfields of Plasma Science and Engineering by providing a turbulence modeling and simulation approach applicable to different types of plasma models, and therefore enabling the computational investigation of diverse natural (e.g., astrophysical jets, solar flares, earth's magnetosphere, lightning) and technological (e.g., confined fusion, planetary entry, processing of materials) plasma flows for which DNS is unfeasible with current and foreseeable computational resources. The project promotes international collaborative research, and has educational impacts by the training of a Ph.D. student, the dissemination of research outcomes through journal publications, and by the outreach of underrepresented undergraduate STEM students into applied academic research through mentorship to the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers at UMass Lowell."
0.197971,"This work aims to answer the question: what happens when an electron (one of the fundamental building blocks of all atoms) scatters from an atom or molecule in the presence of light from a laser? One of the simplest classes of things that can happen is ""elastic scattering"" in which the electron and the atom do not exchange energy and continue on their way after the collision with the same energies that they had before the collision (but perhaps changing their direction). These are called laser-assisted free-free (LAFF) processes because the electron is free (i.e., not bound to an atom or molecule) both before, and after, the collision. This work will involve experimental LAFF studies, with the broad aim of increasing our basic understanding of these processes. Particular attention will be paid to resolving long-standing discrepancies between theory and experiment (there are several sets of experimental data that have defied theoretical explanation for over twenty years) and examining how two-color laser fields affect, and can be used to control, scattering processes. In addition to the advancement of our basic understanding of scattering processes, this work has applications to a variety of fields, both basic and applied. For example, similar processes are important for understanding the interiors and atmospheres of stars. Free-free transitions also play a major role in the gas breakdown that occurs in electrical discharges, and provide a method for laser heating of a plasma (a gas of ionized atoms). Understanding these processes helps form a more solid scientific foundation for the field of plasma physics which underlies the manufacturing of the microelectronics at the heart of our computers and cell phones. This work will primarily take place at an undergraduate institution, and will directly involve several undergraduate students in research.<br/><br/>To accomplish the above stated aims, two different sets of experimental LAFF studies will be performed. The first set of experiments will continue this group's previous work which is well described by theory in spite of the fact that some similar experiments done by another group contradict current theoretical understanding. There are three significant differences between the experiments performed by the two groups: the electron energy, the photon energy, and the photon polarization. The new experiments will investigate a range of incident energies, as well as geometries that have not previously been investigated; e.g., laser propagation direction perpendicular to the scattering plane, and laser polarization direction perpendicular to the scattering plane. Essentially, the experiments will go from perturbative, to non-perturbative regimes. This data will test current theory, as well as provide insight to the development of more complex theoretical descriptions of the LAFF processes. In addition, the new experiments will look for interference effects in LAFF experiments that use a two-color (photon energy = 1.17 eV, and 2.34 eV) laser field. Electrons scattered in such a two-color field that have an energy 2.34 eV below the elastic peak may have emitted either a single 2.34 eV photon or two 1.17 eV photons. The research group will perform experiments that vary the relative phase of these two colors to observe predicted interference effects."
0.198474,"This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at Indiana University (IU). The program will support up to 15 participants for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-17 to carry out experimental and theoretical research projects in a broad range of areas in the IU Physics Department and the IU Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter (CEEM). Special programs for the students include orientation sessions on lab safety, weekly seminars on current research in physics, discussions on professional development and scientific ethics, and short progress reports. At the conclusion of the program, the students will present their results in talks at a closing symposium and develop a way to share their results to a technical audience.

The program emphasizes the development of clear, honest, and concise scientific communication and presentation skills."
0.44,"Exploring new states of matter is a fundamental quest. The strong interaction sector of the Standard Model is described by the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as a quantum field theory of quarks and gluons. Such quarks and gluons are deeply confined in normal matter. However when normal matter is heated to a high enough temperature, it changes into a new deconfined form of QCD matter directly made of the quarks and gluons. Such a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) briefly occupied the Universe at about a few microseconds after the ""Big Bang"", and has now been (re-)created as the hottest matter ever in laboratory by heavy ion collisions (""Little Bang""). Its properties are measured at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) as well as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that the quark-gluon matter created in heavy ion collisions is strongly-interacting both prior to and after reaching thermal equilibrium. Exactly how such strongly interacting nature arises in the many-body setting from the fundamental QCD theory, is a challenging problem that lacks a deep understanding. This project will investigate this missing link and seek to develop effective descriptions of the matter both in and out of equilibrium. The results will advance our understanding of QCD confinement, provide fresh insights into jet quenching mechanism, make significant progress in search of QCD topological effects, and reduce existing uncertainties on the pre-thermal stage. The expected outcome will contribute to our understanding of fundamental questions such as ""how the color confinement phenomenon arises"", and ""how the experimentally observed properties of the quark-gluon matter in and out of equilibrium emerge from QCD"".<br/><br/>The study supported by this award concerns the exploration of new forms of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These activities embody important interdisciplinary aspects, as they are expected to have a profound impact on other areas of physics, ranging from cosmology, supernova, compact stars, to supersymmetric theories, string theories as well as condensed matter physics. This project integrates research with education through mentoring of graduate, as well as undergraduate students. This project will actively pursue a five-year educational outreach plan to develop educational software for computer desktops and mobile devices that utilizes visualization and simulations to demonstrate concepts related to the ""Physics of Extreme Matter"" in an interactive, engaging, and children-friendly manner."
0.469,"Non-technical description:<br/>The answer to the question ""what time is it?"" ultimately traces back to master clocks that are based on the internal ticking of atoms. Increasing the accuracy of these master clocks has in the past enabled such innovations as the GPS systems that we use in our cars and smartphones to locate our position on the globe. Future improvements in clocks can be expected to enable similar innovations that are only just beginning to be imagined. The present project seeks to extend the scope of the science and technology we can achieve by keeping track of time ever more accurately, using molecules instead of atoms. Molecules present the possibility of a quantum clock based on different physics than atomic clocks: nuclear vibrations rather than electronic transitions. Simple molecules that consist of two atoms will be created near the temperature of absolute zero and trapped in standing waves of light to ensure nearly complete isolation from the environment. These strontium molecules possess very well defined internal energy states that allow precise manipulation and probing with laser light. This clock is sensitive to variations in the electron-to-proton mass ratio that may occur as the universe evolves, and to yet undiscovered forces that might appear at nanometer scales. <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>A new class of ultracold diatomic molecules based on laser-cooled strontium atoms was recently demonstrated by the primary investigator's research group. This work (based on optical trapping, manipulation, and imaging of these dimers) will enable precision measurements in molecular physics as well as tests of fundamental laws that may indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model. Initial work indicates that by applying atomic lattice-clock techniques to this molecule in both the excited and ground states, a direct measurement of the nonadiabatic Coriolis mixing angles of the molecular wavefunctions can be performed; these angles are critical for describing weak molecular bonding near the atomic continuum. This project will further characterize the transition from adiabatic to nonadiabatic behavior in these weakly bound systems. Additionally, tightly bound ultracold ground-state strontium dimers will be created for vibrational spectroscopy, or a molecular vibrational clock. If the mass scaling of the van der Waals type interatomic interaction is better understood, this clock can potentially improve the knowledge of nanometer-scale mass-dependent forces by several orders of magnitude. When the systematic effects of lattice spectroscopy of this molecule are better characterized and state-insensitive lattice trapping is optimized as part of this project, this molecular clock can set the best model-independent limit on the stability of the electron-to-proton mass ratio. Robust molecular clocks have applications in geodesy, navigation, and tests of fundamental science. Special efforts are made to involve young public school students from local New York City neighborhoods and expose them to the day-to-day work of scientists."
5.543998,"The research supported by this award investigates: (1) How the spin of the proton is distributed among its parts. Particles emitted when high-energy beams of spin-aligned protons collide in the STAR detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider can reveal how much of the proton's spin is carried by its gluons or by different types of quarks and anti-quarks. The group will search for the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton and explore spin differences among antiquarks. They will also measure how polarized quarks turn into mesons and baryons and search for indications that strongly interacting matter breaks mirror symmetry;(2) The properties and interactions of neutrinos. Neutrinos can change from one form to another, but all the evidence doesn't quite fit at low energies. They will study the reasons for the larger-than-expected neutrino interactions they have measured; (3) How strong the weak force really is. They will gain new insights by observing the angular distribution of the particles created when a neutron decays, and by testing whether nature respects mirror symmetry as neutrons get captured in hydrogen; and (4) What are the properties of the early universe. They will sharpen theoretical predictions of the amount of helium left over in the Big Bang by measuring the decay rate of the neutron.<br/><br/>Their research activities educate the next generation of skilled PhD scientists for jobs in research and teaching universities, industry and national labs, and medical and computer technology. They redirected their cyclotrons to form the Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute, which has treated more than 1000 cancer patients. They co-organize and lecture at summer schools. They participate in the NSF REU program. They mentor their postdocs to facilitate their future entry into teaching and research institutions and the scientific community. They develop undergraduate laboratories emphasizing nuclear technology, bring undergraduates on field trips and assist with programs that encourage pre-college participation in the Indiana University science curriculum. They engage bright young undergraduates in science through jobs or projects which develop the research skills they will need for success in graduate school. They reach out to the local community through a variety of activities to awaken the interest of students in our local public school system by visiting local high school science classes, acting as judges in local science fairs and for the State Science Olympiad, and presenting physics demonstrations at the Indiana State Fair. They actively recruit female and minority applicants for positions at all levels within the group and the physics department by serving on selection committees for faculty searches and research fellowships for women. They work to make their activities known to the public at large through laboratory tours and Open House presentations, science cafe discussions, radio interviews, and press releases in the local media."
0.708501,"This research program is focused on the development and application of rigorous analytical and computational approaches to some longstanding problems in fluid dynamics and turbulence with the goal of deriving reliable mathematical estimates of physically important quantities for solutions of the advection, advection-diffusion, and Navier-Stokes and related systems of partial differential equations. These have important applications in the applied physical sciences and engineering, including weather prediction and climate modeling. <br/>The project has three major components: <br/><br/>Advection: Mathematical mixing measures introduced by the principal investigator and collaborators will be applied to study solutions of the advection and advection-diffusion equations as models of laminar and turbulent mixing. Analysis will place absolute limits on mixing for passive tracers in terms of bulk and/or statistical features of the stirring flows, and it will indicate key features of particularly efficient stirring. New searches for optimal stirring strategies will be undertaken, and the mixing effectiveness of turbulence will be investigated. <br/><br/>Convection: Issues in thermal convection will be studied via analysis and direct numerical simulation. The sharpness of new rigorous limits on heat transport in the classical two-dimensional model of Rayleigh-Benard convection will be tested via asymptotic analysis and computation of laminar flows and high Rayleigh number simulations of turbulent flows. New estimates for three-dimensional convection will be pursued exploiting the maximum principle for the temperature equation in the Boussinesq approximation. <br/><br/>Energy dissipation and enstrophy production: A major new program to determine maximal enstrophy production in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations over finite time intervals will be initiated. Mathematical and computational techniques in the context of maximal palinstrophy production in the two dimensional Navier-Stokes equations will be developed. New methods for determining absolute limits on the bulk and time averaged turbulent energy dissipation rate in solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations will be sought for simple flow setups where current analysis methods fail. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: These projects are suitable for doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers at the University of Michigan. The Principal Investigator's research routinely involves collaborations with graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and distinguished senior researchers in a variety of different departments at institutions across the United States and beyond. These interactions foster broad dissemination of results, stimulate and motivate new investigations, and promote transfer of mathematical methods across disciplinary, institutional, and national boundaries. The Principal Investigator is also actively engaged in organized efforts to encourage and enhance the participation of women and members of under-represented groups in physics and mathematics education and research."
0.456,"This program concerns the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom - either infinite or asymptotically large. Under these circumstances, the detailed behavior of all the constituents is essentially a meaningless concept and one looks for (a) collective behavior of the system as a whole or (b) a statistical description of the behavior of an individual component. The analyses of various systems pursued by the PI will, whenever feasible, embody both descriptions. The studies will use four interrelated methods from depictions of condensed matter problems. These are (i) Classical Spin & Particle Systems, (ii) Quantum Spin Systems, (iii) Interacting Particle Models and (iv) Cluster Models/Graphical Representations. Problems from all four categories will be examined. Specific instances include discontinuous phase transitions in quantum, classical and continuum fluid systems, the disruptions and enhancements of transport due to inhomogeneities in disordered media and the approach of critical 2D systems to their continuum conformal invariant limits. The PI maintains extensive contact with physicists in the areas of field theory and condensed matter physics as well as mathematicians from various subdisciplines. Most often the PI brings to bear the necessary mathematics in order to elicit enhanced understanding of a physical system. On occasion, physical insight for a particular system can influence the associated areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Broader Impact. A philosophy which became prevalent beginning in the late 1960s is that of universality - largescale and/or longtime collective behaviors do not depend on the details of the model. Hence, while the primary scientific goals of this proposal lean towards the advancement of the physical sciences, these investigations lead directly to considerations of models with supplemental applications. In particular: (1) Studies of collective swarming behavior in biological systems and in crowded human aggregations with further applications to surveillance and gathering of intelligence. (2) Studies of criminal behavior with applications to hotspot formation in the statistical occurrences of residential burglaries and to hostility reciprocations of rival street gangs. (3) Studies of the dissemination and flow of information in large scale networks. This research encompasses an extensive array of applications research opportunities at every level. The program will require the assistance of many collaborators and extensive use of the facilities at UCLA. The PI has collaborated with undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and senior level coresearchers from a variety of cultural backgrounds with both genders adequately represented."

0.31284,"The award includes three projects at Jefferson Lab (JLab): (a) developing a new experiment to measure the proton charge radius with a sub-percent precision; (b) extracting the lifetime of the pi-zero meson with an unprecedented 1.4% precision from the PrimEx-II data set; and (c) developing and preparing the approved experiment to measure the lifetime of the eta meson in the newly developing Hall D. As one of the most fundamental quantities, accurate knowledge of the proton size was always important in physics. Very recently, a new result from a muonic-hydrogen experiment, with its unprecedented less than 0.1% precision, stated that the proton size is up to 7 standard deviations smaller than it was previously known to be. This experimental fact triggered the well-known ""proton radius crisis"" in physics. To address this crisis, a collaboration led by the PI of this award developed a uniquely designed electron-scattering experiment that was approved by PAC38 at JLab with the major condition of developing a new windowless gas hydrogen target. Precision measurements of the light pseudo-scalar meson lifetimes continue to be an important part of this award. The PrimEx collaboration performed the first measurement (PrimEx-I) of the pi-zero meson lifetime with the best precision up to date (2.8% in total). The results have been published and included in the Particle Data Group average. To reach the projected unprecedented 1.4% precision, our collaboration upgraded the experimental setup and performed the second (PrimEx-II) experiment in the fall of 2010. Under this award, the analysis process will be completed, and the results published. Under the leadership of the PI, a award to measure the eta meson lifetime with the best up to now precision (3%) was developed and approved to run in Hall D at JLab. We will prepare this experiment to run for the next few years.<br/><br/>Precise knowledge of the proton size is critically important for understanding of the structure of hadronic matter. In addition, it is very important for atomic physics, in particular, the spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen. The currently developed experimental situation with the proton size limits the determination of the Rydberg constant, one of the basic and the most precisely known constant in physics up to now. The proposed experiment, with its independent novel approach and projected precision, has a direct potential to either significantly shift the current value of the Rydberg constant (if it confirms recent muonic-hydrogen result) or question the sufficiency of the basic theory calculations in muonic-hydrogen system. In the latter case, it may also indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model. The lifetimes of the light pseudo-scalar mesons carry direct information about the symmetries, and in particular, their partial breaking effects in the theory of interaction in physics. Therefore, the precise knowledge of these important quantities will serve as benchmark tests to our understanding of Nature. In particular, the anticipated high precision measurement of the eta lifetime will significantly improve the ratio of light quark masses in a direct and most model independent way in physics. The quark masses and their ratios are input into the contemporary particle physics from the experiment. This project will provide advanced and highest scientific training for African-American students in a field where they are currently under-represented."
0.277179,"Particle physics experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN seek to explore fundamental questions in modern physics, such as how particles attain mass, why gravity is weak, and the nature of dark matter.

This project will investigate new algorithms and techniques for data analysis using emerging computing processor architectures. These activities will enable the LHC experiments to take data more efficiently and improve the quality of the data that is recorded in order to extend the reach of the next generation of discoveries from planned hardware upgrades at the LHC over the next decade. The results of this research will significantly reduce the cost of computing for all LHC experiments. Software source code tools will be made available to the particle physics community. The investigators will host workshops to train post-doctoral fellows and graduate students from all areas of particle physics on how to use these advanced techniques. This training is valuable preparation for dealing with big data science in general.<br/><br/>This project will support research focused on novel compute architectures for parallelized and vectorized charged particle track reconstruction. This research will improve the reach of energy-frontier particle physics experiments, such as the ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE experiments at the LHC and any other fields where studying the passage of charged particles is of critical importance.

0.15,"The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Many of the most dramatic of observed astrophysical phenomena, seen through the windows of electromagnetic radiation or gravitational effects, occur in regions of strong gravitational and/or electromagnetic fields. Phenomena like relativistic jets outpouring from centers of galaxies or those marking the death of a massive star in a supernova explosion are examples of scenarios that can only be explained by carefully describing gravity and electromagnetic fields simultaneously. The magnetic field of the neutron star that results from a supernova explosion can be a billion times stronger than the strongest human-made magnets. Its gravitational field can be so strong that a spoonful of matter at the neutron star surface can weigh as much as a mountain on Earth. This award supports research on the strong-field environments of neutron stars and black holes, objects for which these strong-field phenomena are especially prominent.<br/><br/>The specific systems to be studied are point masses orbiting black holes and magnetically dominated (force-free) plasmas near stars and black holes. The techniques are mainly analytical as opposed to numerical. Self-force effects on a point mass orbiting near a rapidly spinning black hole will be computed and used to inform astrophysical source modeling as well as thought experiments testing the cosmic censorship conjecture. Equations for the self-force will be formulated in alternative gauges and alternative gravitational theories. New force-free solutions will be found by exploiting spacetime methods and developing new perturbative techniques, with an overall goal of developing a broad understanding of force-free electrodynamics and its application to electromagnetic energy extraction from astrophysical black holes. The project will contribute to the training of Ph.D. students, and the research results will be disseminated to the public through research publications as well as news articles and public lectures where appropriate."
0.702,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. One of the most exciting quests in particle physics is the search for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Extensions of the standard model predict not only new particles with masses above the electroweak scale (about 100 billion electron-volts, eV), but also so-called WISPs (Weakly Interacting Sub-eV Particles). The most famous WISP candidate is the axion, which has been introduced to explain the smallness of Charge-Parity (CP) violation in Quantum ChromoDynamics and which turns out to also be a prime candidate for a constituent of the dark matter in the universe. Similarly, axion-like particles, light spin 1 particles called ""hidden sector photons,"" seem to occur naturally in realistic embeddings of the standard model into string theory. It is therefore an important and fundamental question whether any of these weakly-interacting light particles exists. <br/><br/>The Any Light Particle Search (ALPS) experiment will give students and postdoctoral scientists the opportunity to develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines spanning lasers and optics, electronics and feedback control systems, vacuum and cryogenics, computational methods and data analysis algorithm development. The required technologies are spin-offs of technologies that were developed for ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors. The work supported by this award will build on these investments and continue the development of techniques and devices which have commercial applications in the laser and optics industries.<br/><br/>The ALPS experiment is a ""shining light through a wall"" study. In such an experiment, laser light traveling through a strong magnetic field may (in part) be converted to axions or axion-like particles. These particles are so weakly interacting that they can pass unimpeded through an opaque wall and then convert (in part) back to photons in a second ""regeneration"" region of a strong magnetic field where they are detected. The most sensitive laboratory setup thus far is the first stage of ALPS I concluded in 2010. With major upgrades in magnetic length, laser power and the detection system, the proposed ALPS II experiment aims at improving the sensitivity by a few orders of magnitude for the different WISPs. This award will enable US participation in the ALPS experiment by bringing the group's expertise in seismic isolation and suspension systems."
0.37,"Investigating the rarest of processes between elementary particles is a very powerful tool in understanding Nature at its most fundamental level. The Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) program investigates the fundamental nature of the neutrino, that intriguing elementary particle that for a long time was thought to have no mass, doesn't interact with much of anything, and may hold the key to why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe. The EXO program carries out its study of the neutrino by searching for the existence of a nuclear decay called neutrino-less double beta decay. Beta decay involves the emission of an electron from the nucleus, and is always accompanied by the emission of an antineutrino. Neutrino-less double beta decay would be a process in which a nucleus (xenon-136 in this case) transforms by emitting two electrons (and nothing else). According to the Standard Model of particle physics, this can only happen if neutrinos and antineutrinos are exactly the same. Such a direct overlap between matter and antimatter could prove essential in answering one of the most fundamental questions in science: why is our Universe made exclusively of matter? <br/><br/>The first experiment of the program, EXO-200, uses 200 kg of liquefied xenon enriched in the 136 isotope as a source and has operated at the underground Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico since 2010. EXO-200 is set to run for another 3 years, and this award will support the PI and his group for up to three years. The accumulated data will allow scientists to probe the existence of neutrino-less double beta decay should this process happen with a characteristic half-life of up four million billion times the current age of the universe. The detector technology used in EXO-200 pioneers the use of selected materials with ultra-low levels of residual radioactivity in order to produce the most radio-quiet environment for the detection of rare events. Some of these cleanliness protocols and requirements are now reaching the electronics and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, the large noble liquid detectors, such as the one used in EXO-200, are finding increased applications outside of particle physics, in particular in nuclear reactor fuel cycle and composition monitoring and in medical imaging (e.g. PET scan machines). The EXO-200 project is proving an ideal stage for graduate students to grow into researchers with both data analysis and hardware expertise. The UMass group has a track record of successfully involving a diverse population of undergraduate students in core areas of the project. The newly established Amherst Center for Fundamental Interactions provides a stimulating and productive environment for a broad scientific exchange between experimentalists and theorists. <br/><br/>The UMass group plays a central role in fully exploiting the data from the EXO-200 experiment. The chosen xenon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) technology allows the project to take advantage of the radiation self-shielding properties of high-Z xenon, in a homogeneous layout with excellent event tracking capability and energy resolution. The work includes a comprehensive study of processes with spatial topology, such as bb decay of 136Xe to excited states of 136Ba, 137Xe background, and high energy gamma-rays originating from cosmic muon interactions with detector components. An integral part of the proposal is a laboratory program at UMass to test optical properties of various detector materials and surfaces in liquid xenon and to use the results from these measurements in a ray-tracing optical simulation of EXO-200. Together with focused tests of novel detectors for the Vacuum Ultra-Violet (VUV) scintillation light produced in xenon (silicon photo-multipliers in particular), they are part of investigations under way towards a tonne-scale, next generation experiment (nEXO) for neutrinoless double beta decay."
0.95,"The research program explores quantum dynamical processes for strong radiative interactions between one atom and the electromagnetic field of a microscopic optical cavity. The setting for these investigations is cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) in a domain of strong coupling in which the time scale for coherent quantum evolution of an interacting atom and photon is much shorter than the times scale for irreversible decay.<br/><br/>Capabilities are being developed to trap single atoms within the evanescent fields of microscopic optical resonators with extremely low optical losses, thereby enabling cavity QED with critical atom and photon numbers significantly beyond current and projected values for conventional optical cavities. With a single atom-cavity system, nonlinear interactions between single photon pulses are investigated, including entangling operations between `flying photons' and quantum non-demolition measurements of single-photon fields. Multiple atom-cavity systems are being linked together for investigations of the creation and distribution of quantum entanglement among atom-cavity systems at remote locations by way of photon-mediated interactions.<br/><br/>The research program propels optical physics beyond traditional nonlinear optics and laser physics into a regime with quantum dynamical processes now involving atoms and photons taken one by one. On the one hand, the research extends knowledge of fundamental radiative processes for the interaction of light and matter. On the other hand, the research endeavors to harness these basic radiative processes to create new scientific possibilities and technical capabilities in Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Science (QIS).<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research program include applications ranging from measurements of fundamental constants to the development of novel semiconductor devices to the deterministic generation of entangled photon pairs. The research contributes to the realization of complex quantum networks by way of interactions in cavity QED. Such capabilities could have broad impact, including for quantum computation, communication, and metrology. The attainment of strong coupling in atomic physics has inspired similar investigations in a wide class of physical systems, including quantum dots coupled to micro-pillars and photonic bandgap cavities and Cooper-pairs interacting with superconducting resonators.<br/><br/>The research program makes contributions to education and human resources in areas of immediate importance to the nation's scientific and technological future by way of advanced training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars. With the end of scalability of conventional silicon-based information technology on the horizon, such investments in the training of talented young scientists are vitally important."
1.175,"Gravitational waves are a straightforward but profound prediction of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. They have never been directly measured, but the ripples in space time produced by distant violent astrophysical events will soon be detectable by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), with detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. LIGO's detectors use precision laser interferometry to measure the relative motion of exquisitely isolated test mass mirrors due to the extremely small fluctuations in the difference of the 4km-arm lengths. Louisiana State University (LSU) is located approximately 40 km from LIGO Livingston (LLO) and has a long-term collaborative relationship with LIGO as a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), an international group of hundreds of scientists researching the technology for gravitational wave detectors and analyzing the data taken with LIGO detectors. <br/><br/>This award to the LSU group will be used to allow the PI to fulfill her duties as the elected spokesperson of the LSC; to characterize data from the subsystems of Advanced LIGO detectors as they are installed, allowing the improvement of the data quality and astrophysical reach of the detectors; and to research ways to improve the calibration methods used for the Advanced LIGO detectors. In addition to advancing the science reach of Advanced LIGO detectors, the award will develop scientific human resources (graduate students and postdocs). Moreover, the members of the LSU group supported by this award will disseminate the results of their research to the general public and work to increase the participation of under-represented minorities in scientific research."
0.325,"This experimental physics research program explores the underlying structure and interactions of molecular matter in new, unexplored regimes. This award will support the continuation of research investigating helium-based diatomic molecules. Helium is the most chemically inert of all the atoms, but not so inert that it cannot form molecules. Very few measurements have been made of the properties of these elusive ""van der Waals"" molecules. Their structure and formation will be studied spectroscopically, providing an understanding of matter in this extreme weakly-bound limit. In addition, the award will support a continuation of research investigating molecular collisions and chemical reactions at a temperature of one degree above absolute zero. This ""cold chemistry"" is important for understanding the fundamental physics underlying chemical reactions, and provides more sensitive tests of theory than traditional ""hot"" chemistry.<br/><br/>The research will improve our understanding of the structure and chemical reactions of molecular matter, the primary form of all matter on earth. As such, it may one day lead to new methods of controlling chemical reactions and chemical synthesis. In addition, the study of reactions at cold temperatures will improve our understanding of the interstellar medium. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art optical techniques, as well as cryogenics, vacuum, electronics, and computer-based data acquisition and analysis."
0.933334,"This award is part of the NSF effort to promote significant advances in the fundamental understanding of cancer biology made possible through multidisciplinary research that involves experts in theoretical physics, applied mathematics, and computer science.<br/><br/>Pancreatic cancer is a common and increasing cause of cancer death. While innovative strategies involving the immune system have brought progress in the treatment of many cancers, these strategies have to date been ineffective in pancreatic cancer. These tumors release immunosuppressive molecules and act as a physical barrier causing reduced immune cell infiltration and activation. Recently it was shown that large doses of Vitamin D result in reduced immunosuppression and increased immune cell infiltration in tumors, setting the stage for an effective immune cell attack on pancreatic cancer. The heart of this project is the use of theoretical modeling and statistical understanding of immune cell repertoires to design successful immune system attack on the cancer. <br/><br/>In this project a team of theoretical physicists and cancer researchers will work together to design quantitative strategies based on the immune system to attack pancreatic cancer. Novel theoretical and experimental tools will be used to characterize the immunological environment of pancreatic cancer tumors and the detailed understanding of the immune cell response dynamics will be used to develop innovative interventions. The project will focus on quantifying the poorly understood immune environment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. T cell receptor sequence repertoires, the cancer exome, and RNA expression will be obtained from tumor tissue of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus a high dose vitamin D. Whether the T cells infiltrating patient tumors represent unique or oligoclonal cell populations will be determined. Parallel studies will systematically assess cytokine expression and the expression of checkpoint proteins, as well as the presence of immunoregulatory cell populations. Exome sequencing analysis using theoretical physics and mathematical approaches will be used to gain initial insight into potential neo-antigens expressed by tumors. The quantitative models and analysis tools will be used to develop integrated platform for attacking this cancer.<br/><br/>This proposal is cofunded by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division."
0.24,"Among the key predictions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the Universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for the goal of direct detection of gravitational waves, as the second generation of gravitational-wave detectors is commissioned at the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO). The sensitivity of the new aLIGO detectors will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. The aLIGO data will be used to search for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological gravitational wave sources. This specific award will support research that searches the aLIGO data to look for the background signals that arise from gravitational-wave signals from many independent sources. <br/><br/>The first observation data from aLIGO is expected in 2015, with the sensitivity and duty-cycle of the detectors steadily increasing over the following three years. This project focuses on the searches for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), which arises from an incoherent superposition of gravitational-wave signals generated by many independent sources. The SGWB could be of cosmological origin: for example, in inflationary models the SGWB is generated just moments after the Big Bang, implying that the SGWB may contain unique information about the first moments in the evolution of the universe and about the physics of energy scales not accessible in laboratories. Similarly, the SGWB could be of astrophysical origin: for example, summing up contributions from all magnetars or from coalescences of all binary neutron stars and/or black holes in the universe leads to a stochastic gravitational-wave ""foreground"" that contains information about these most violent objects and events in the universe. <br/><br/>The SGWB searches with aLIGO data will be conducted using cross-correlation techniques that were developed and successfully used in the SGWB searches with initial LIGO data. The searches for isotropic SGWB are expected to result in a measurement about 1000x more sensitive than the current best upper limits. Similarly, the searches for anisotropic SGWB will result in about 100x more sensitive measurement than the current best upper limits. Such substantial advances will result in a series of interesting cosmological and astrophysical implications, including detection or new constraints on parity violation in the early universe, evolution of the universe during the first minute after the Big Bang, equation of state in neutron stars, rate of compact binary coalescences and its evolution with redshift."
0.972168,"In this project, the PIs at Georgia Tech (GT) will join the existing Physics of Living Systems Student Research Network. Growth of the GT program will: 1) bring research topics in underrepresented areas to the PoLS SRN, 2) integrate PoLS at GT into the broader bio-related community at GT, in turn creating a hub in the Southeast of the US for PoLS, 3) create sustained interaction with faculty at world-leading institutions while lubricating opportunities for national and international collaborations, 4) create new PoLS experimental, modeling and theoretical tools, 5) create new PoLS curriculum, 6) train students and postdocs who can advance PoLS at GT and become the next generation of PoLS researchers. The co-PIs on this proposal include four scientists from the Biophysics Group in the School of Physics (SoP), one from Mechanical Engineering, and a senior member of the SoP. They are joined by approximately 20 faculty within and outside the SoP who have research interests that fall within the scope of PoLS. These represent areas within the College of Sciences and the College of Engineering at Georgia Tech. In the last five years, the SoP at Georgia Tech has begun to develop a program in biophysics with the goal to become a world leader in this area, and also help develop technologies that can advance both basic science and human health. The core Biophysics Group in the SoP (consisting of four primary faculty and four adjunct faculty) seeks to understand how physics can inform questions of structure, function and dynamics in biological systems, and to study fundamental physics questions posed by biological systems. As a goal for future growth and leadership, the group intends to build on the successes and strengths of the nonlinear science and soft matter communities at GT. A second goal is to integrate their program with the already world-class engineering programs (specifically bioengineering) at GT."

0.14,"Collision physics is currently enjoying an incredibly exciting time as a consequence of recent new experimental advances. One of these advances is the COLTRIMS (cold-target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy) method which can be used to obtain full three-dimensional pictures of a collision process. These 3D pictures contain very detailed information about the fundamental forces controlling nature on the atomic/molecular level and the challenge for theory is to see if our theoretical models can accurately predict what is observed experimentally. One of the most sensitive probes of the important fundamental forces is charged particle ionization of atoms/molecules. Problems of this type are called the few-body problem. For two particles, the problem is completely solved since we have exact quantum mechanical solutions. For three particles, there is no exact quantum mechanical solution so this is one of the important fundamental unsolved problems in physics. The only way to study the problem is to develop theoretical models and compare the predictions of the model with experimental measurements. Although significant progress has been made for understanding the 3-body problem, there is still much work to be done particularly for collisions with larger atoms and molecules, interactions that are important in numerous gas-phase processes in Nature and in applied fields of research. The 4-body problem is significantly more difficult than the 3-body problem and, so far, the amount of work done on the 4-body problem is limited. The purpose of this project is to theoretically examine several open questions in the field of charged particle ionization of atoms and molecules for both the 3-body and 4-body problems and for both electron-impact and heavy-particle impact. <br/><br/>There are two types of theoretical approaches which can be used for these problems - perturbative and non-perturbative. Non-perturbative methods can be used for collisions with small atoms and small molecules and they are generally more accurate than non-perturbative. For larger atoms and molecules, the only approach that is currently feasible is the perturbative approach which is proposed for this work. Previously, the PI has shown that an approach called the 3-body distorted wave (3DW) for atoms or molecular 3-body distorted wave (M3DW) for molecules predicts results which are in very good agreement with experiment with experiment for some atoms (He, Ne) and some molecules (H2, N2), relatively good agreement with experiment with experiment for some atoms (Ar, Kr) and some molecules (NH3, CH4), qualitative agreement for some molecules (formic acid (CH2O2), pyrimidine (C4H4N2), tetrahydrofuran (THF C4H8O), tetrahydrofurfuran alcohol (THFA, C5H10O2), tetrahydropyran (THP, C5H10O), and 1,4-dioxane (C4H8O2)), and very poor agreement for some other molecules (SF6). One of the objectives of the proposed work is to improve the M3DW model for electron-impact collisions with molecules. There are fewer detailed experimental measurements for heavy-particle collisions than for electron-impact collisions and the theoretical models tend to be less sophisticated. Another objective of this work is to improve the theoretical models for both 3-body and 4-body collisions for heavy particles for both atoms and molecules."
0.36,"This project will support the development, testing, and subsequent implementation of a fast data analysis pipeline for searching gravitational-wave (GW) signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) in the data of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and other second-generation detectors. These detectors are expected to make the first direct observations of gravitational waves and herald the birth of GW astronomy by harnessing information on the distribution of the sources in the sky, distance, masses, and spins. These observations may also shed light on the nature of the host galaxies of CBCs. This project will also support work on aLIGO commissioning and instrumentation at the Hanford site, and the development of rapid detector characterization techniques and tools. To catch a prompt electromagnetic or neutrino emission from a CBC it is critical that the duty factors of the GW detectors be high for sky localization, and detector characterization and background estimation be rapid so that robust GW alerts can be communicated to electromagnetic and neutrino observatories.<br/><br/>Rapid detector characterization will facilitate the publishing of gravitational-wave data to the public, with robust data quality flags in hand. This project will also engage the faculty of the Washington State University campuses in Pullman and Tri-Cities in education and outreach on gravitational-wave science. The latter campus caters to a large percentage of Hispanic and Native-American populations, both of which are under-represented, and offers a rare setting for integrating university education with cutting-edge research in gravitation being carried out at a nearby lab."
0.075,"It is widely believed that the most fundamental constituents of some of the most common elementary particles are quarks, and their anti-matter counterpart, anti-quarks. By probing the existence and structure of these particles, it is possible to learn about the underlying principles governing quark and anti-quark matter. The work in this project will use data collected at the Belle experiment at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) laboratory in Japan to measure the formation of particles known as mesons that consist of a quark-antiquark pair. By studying these mesons, one can probe fundamental physics processes such as Charge Parity (CP) violation, rare meson decays and the existence of possible exotic particles which could indicate the presence of Dark Matter. This effort has a particular focus on the support of students, thereby contributing to the development of a much-needed high tech workforce.<br/><br/>Belle is built around the interaction region of an asymmetric electron-positron collider, with electrons having the energy of 8 GeV and positrons having the energy of 3.5 GeV, giving 10.58 GeV center-of-mass energy. The main goal of Belle is to detect mesons made of a quark-anti-quark pair, in particular those mesons made of charm quarks (charmonium) and bottom quarks (bottomonium). The Belle Experiment at KEK in Japan has the world's largest data samples recorded at the bottomonium resonances: upsilon (5S), upsilon (2S) and upsilon (1S). The central aim of this project is to perform very precise measurements of details of fragmentation (the break-up of resonant particles such as the upsilon) and hadronization (the process of initial state quarks and gluons decaying into detectable particles like pions and photons) at a center of mass energy of 10 GeV. This will provide tests of Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD), providing detailed information for theoretical Lattice QCD calculations. The decays of the upsilon(1S) resonance to gluons and photons provides a precise measurement of the QCD strong coupling constant."

The detection of continuous gravitational waves from rotating neutron stars would be especially interesting because many such sources are expected to continue emitting for long durations, allowing follow-up investigation of increasing precision, and because it is believed that these waves will provide insight into the poorly known structure of these exotic stars. The research to be carried out, on both the instrumental and analytical sides, will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art science at the frontier of knowledge.<br/><br/>Research will focus on a number of specific areas related to the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) Experiment: 1) co-leading the ongoing LIGO Scientific Collaboration's search for continuous gravitational waves; 2) carrying out searches for those waves from both isolated and binary neutron stars using programs developed previously by the University of Michigan gravitational waves group; 3) developing new search algorithms with improved sensitivity and computational efficiency; and 4) detector characterization of Advanced LIGO interferometers focused on spectral line identification and mitigation."

In the coming decades, pulsed lasers ""in the form of optical frequency combs"" will help unravel current mysteries in science, such as dark energy or the potential time-dependence of fundamental constants.

0.14,"Most every-day life processes are governed by classical mechanics. Newton's second law of motion is a well-known example of this. In certain situations, quantum mechanical laws come into play and the classical laws no longer provide an accurate description of the system dynamics. The quantum mechanical laws are well established. However, applying these laws and making quantitative predictions is a highly challenging task of fundamental and technical importance. The periodic table and nuclear chart, for example, are the result of quantum mechanical considerations, as are the working principles of solar cells. The activities supported by the grant will greatly advance our understanding of quantum mechanical few-body systems. These systems serve as prototypes for more complex systems. Where possible, the planned theoretical studies will be benchmarked against experimental results. As part of this program, multiple graduate and undergraduate students will be trained. These students will have access to state-of-the-art computing resources and will develop strong numerical and analytical skills; thus, they will be well prepared for a variety of future pursuits in academia, at national labs or in industry.<br/><br/><br/>Near zero temperature, few-body correlations are often times governed by just a few parameters such as the two-body s-wave scattering length and the two-body effective range. This suggests that effective low-energy few-atom Hamiltonians can be utilized to describe the key aspects of cold few-body collisions and of weakly-bound few-body states. The idea of replacing the true interactions by effective interactions is similar to what Fermi did in his groundbreaking 1934 paper on the scattering between slow neutrons and bound hydrogen atoms. The present grant capitalizes on experimental and theoretical advances in cold atom physics and provides support for theoretical studies of cold few-atom systems. Techniques will be developed and applied to solve the time-independent Schrodinger equation for different classes of non-trivial few-body systems, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of few-particle correlations and universal low-energy features. The analytical approaches include perturbative treatments around the strongly-coupled regime and the use of a hyperspherical coordinate approach that can be viewed as a trap analog of the Bethe ansatz. Numerical techniques include a Lippmann-Schwinger equation based treatment and a basis set expansion technique that utilizes explicitly correlated Gaussians."
2.372188,"Recent years have seen enormous progress in the physics of neutrino mixing, but several critical questions remain: What is the value of 13, the last unmeasured mixing angle in the neutrino mixing matrix? What is the mass hierarchy? Do neutrino oscillations violate CP symmetry? Why are the quark and neutrino mixing matrices so different? The value of 13 is central to each of these questions. Its value sets the scale for experiments needed to resolve the mass hierarchy and to search for CP violation. In addition, the size of 13 with respect to the other mixing angles may give insights into the origin of these angles and source of neutrino mass. Reactor experiments hold the promise of unambiguously determining the 13 mixing angle.<br/><br/>This proposal, from the University of Chicago, Columbia University and Barnard College, requests funds to construct the outer muon veto and tagging system for the Double Chooz neutrino oscillation experiment. The goal of the experiment is the measurement of 13 with almost an order-of-magnitude better sensitivity than the current best limit. The veto system is the main detector element used to suppress backgrounds and to understand their systematic uncertainties, which will be essential to reaching the experiment's sensitivity goal. <br/><br/>The Double Chooz Experiment will use two detectors near the Chooz Nuclear Power Station in France. As a result of the few MeV energy of the reactor antineutrinos, cosmogenic backgrounds are a serious issue for reactor experiments. The Double Chooz Experiment uses a two-part, inner-outer veto system to reduce and measure these backgrounds. This group proposes to construct the outer veto, a large-area system of scintillating counters placed above the detector. In addition to providing significant background suppression, the outer veto is expected to be a powerful tool in studying individual backgrounds, particularly the 9Li background which is the dominant background systematic uncertainty.<br/><br/>As for the Broader Impacts of this project, if the Double Chooz experiment demonstrates that 13 is nonzero, searches for CP violation will be particularly compelling. CP violation in the neutrino sector may ultimately help explain the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the universe through leptogenesis. Observation of any CP violation in the neutrino sector would be an important clue to one of the most fundamental questions in particle physics."
0.51834,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project will focus on the development of a detector based on liquid argon to search for the so-called sterile neutrino, whose existence is suggested by BSM theories.<br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which refines LArTPC technology, using the Liquid Argon Near Detector (Lar1ND) and the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL. Both of these experiments will further the study of potential signals of sterile neutrinos. Sterile neutrinos are proposed BSM particles that could explain aspects of cosmology and astrophysics such as Dark Matter. MicroBooNE will make a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with the superior LArTPC, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence.

The strategies and insights gained through this activity are expected to be useful in other fields where women are severely underrepresented. Outreach and dissemination will maximize the benefit of the conference in the U.S. The project will be informed by an evaluation conducted by the Statistical Research Center of the American Institute of Physics."
0.1541,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, left over from the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Experimental efforts to detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the Galaxy, yielding a sidereal modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. <br/><br/>The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) dark matter experiment is a leader in the field of directional dark matter detection, with sensitivity to the powerful angular signature of nuclear recoils induced by WIMPs. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. The collaboration will be testing their next prototype detector, DRIFT-IIe, above ground at Occidental College. It features an inherently scalable design including a redesigned field cage, a texturized, thin-film cathode, a new, transparent wire readout which doubles the fiducial volume per readout, and a new every-wire data acquisition system which allows for lower noise and fiducialization in the detector plane. <br/><br/>The potential of DRIFT's capabilities have promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments. Broader impacts of this work also include the training of a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience."
0.165016,"This award supports Optics and Photonics Training for Inquisitive eXperimentalists (OPTIX), a project to create an innovative, hands-on laboratory environment at Willamette University where undergraduate sophomores and juniors can work with research grade optics equipment in a dedicated space designed to foster deep, inquiry-based learning. Students will complete carefully designed modules that encourage creativity and independence, preparing them better for a more rigorous and meaningful senior year capstone project and giving them vital skills and motivation for a career in the STEM fields after graduation. Modules will also be developed for local community college students at Chemeketa Community College, and an optics related hands-on exhibition for the Gilbert House Children's Museum in Salem, OR.<br/><br/>The optics modules will require different levels of student sophistication, training, and involvement. The most basic optics module will provide an introduction to optics, and serve as a gateway to the more advanced activities. Students at the sophomore level then continue taking three additional basic modules that introduce them to more sophisticated ideas and techniques. The focus at the junior level is on intermediate modules, some of which are extensions of modules encountered during the sophomore year and others which lead into the advanced modules that students can take in their senior year or as independent research projects to prepare them for the transition into research labs. The effectiveness of this initiative will be ascertained by assessing student skills and attitudes before, during, and after exposure to OPTIX modules with the help of an external evaluator."
0.057862,"This award supports a project to investigate the development of undergraduate students' mathematical understanding in the context of learning physics, particularly while solving challenging upper-division physics problems. The project team will conduct an integrated program of research, curriculum development, and assessment of topics covering a typical sophomore- or junior-level course in mathematical methods. The broad goals are to conduct research on student resources, study the process of transfer from mathematics to physics and the coevolution of knowledge in the two disciplines, and develop a set of Math / Physics tasks suitable for instruction, research, and assessment materials that will integrate challenging math content with topics covered in upper-division physics core courses. This project has the potential to impact a gateway course to the upper division for physics majors. Curricular materials will be shared through electronic clearinghouses and via published research and it is anticipated that the project will inform instruction - both of math methods courses and subsequent physics courses in which the mathematics is used - nationally and internationally. The student population at California State University Fullerton includes many students from groups traditionally underrepresented in physics, so this project will provide access to research-based materials for these students and also ensure a diverse research population. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project brings together physics education research (PER) and research in undergraduate math education (RUME). It blends efforts at identifying and addressing student conceptual difficulties in physics with efforts toward understanding knowledge transfer in mathematics. The work targets a key course for physics majors, the mathematical methods course that is offered in most departments at the sophomore- or junior-level. This course is typically intended to be a bridge between introductory physics and calculus courses and the more challenging mathematics and physics encountered by students in the core courses of electricity and magnetism, classical mechanics, and modern physics / quantum mechanics. The project will strengthen the research base in a portion of the curriculum that has, to this point, largely gone unexamined, and will touch upon, and build upon, work in several related areas, including PER in other upper-division courses as well as the extensive research base in undergraduate mathematics education. This proposed work will provide significant insights into transfer by probing the extent to which the nature of student understanding depends upon the disciplinary context. The research team has many years' experience in PER and RUME and have collaborated on successful research and curriculum development projects at the upper division in thermal physics and the physics-mathematics interface."
0.005338,"This award supports an effort to expand and enrich the COMPASS program at UC Berkeley, which is aimed at improving the education and retention of under-represented students (primarily in Physics). There are five universities with similar programs based on the COMPASS model: University of Colorado Boulder, University of Maryland College Park, Rochester Institute of Technology, Chicago State University, and Arizona State University. This project joins these institutions and UC Berkeley to form the Access Network, designed to develop best practices through shared expertise. The Access network will support the development of programs intended to improve diversity and access in physics by innovating strategies to build Compass-like programs in new contexts. The network will enhance the efforts of each individual site, build knowledge of best practices for launching new programs, and share this knowledge with the physics community. A robust evaluation of the project will identify the impact of the network on supporting diversity programs and how it contributes to the dissemination of successful strategies and program elements.<br/><br/>The Access network will: (a) empower students and faculty - especially those from marginalized and/or underrepresented groups - as agents in the design, implementation, and iterative improvement of retention efforts, (b) facilitate communication and community among those involved in such efforts, and (c) create and maintain a repository of materials and strategies, all in order to (d) support local communities in adapting these materials and program elements to their unique contexts and populations. To achieve these goals, the project will engage in the following activities: (1) an annual assembly of the member programs, (2) inter-program communication through regular conference calls and inter-institutional travel, (3) documentation of local and inter-institutional innovations, and (4) synthesis and dissemination of member programs' educational materials."
0.18,"This project will investigate how atoms can be used to test our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature, i.e. our understanding of elementary particles and their interactions. While one can search for new particles directly with large collider facilities, it is also possible to test the effects that new particles could have on processes occurring in atoms and molecules. Such experiments require very high precision and a very good understanding of the systems that are being studied. Moreover, certain atoms and molecules might be much better suited to the studies of fundamental interactions owing to their having properties that enhance desired effects. This project will investigate which systems are the best for future studies of this kind. The experimental work in this field also requires theoretical analysis of the experiments, and this work will provide such analysis and will develop methods to improve the accuracy further. This research is at the interface of atomic physics with high-energy physics, nuclear physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology. While the main goal of this project is to study fundamental symmetries, the methodologies described in this project are applicable to the development of atomic clocks, laser cooling and trapping, study of super-heavy elements, production and control of ultracold molecules, study of degenerate quantum gases, astrophysics, plasma physics, and nuclear physics. Graduate students will be directly involved in the forefront research under this grant and will present the research at the scientific meetings.<br/><br/>The main objective of this research is to develop theoretical methods to advance fundamental symmetry tests with atomic and molecular systems in the search of new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project is focused on the study of parity violation and the search for a permanent electric-dipole moment (EDM). The group will develop theoretical methods that will allow identification of the best systems for the next generation of experiments and provide calculations that are crucial for the analysis of current and past experiments. Specific efforts include: (1) introduce the Sturm basis sets and test the performance of all the group?s existing methods using more compact and regular Sturmian basis set functions; (2) develop an accurate method to evaluate contributions of highly-excited states in the sum-over-state approach in order to resolve present problems with the analysis of the most precise parity non-conservation (PNC) study in Cesium; (3) develop a next-generation Configuration Interaction+all-order code for accurate calculations of PNC amplitudes relevant to current experimental research; (4) explore the addition of the effective Hamiltonian to the molecular configuration interaction (CI) code for the study of diatomic molecules."
0.35,"Complex plasmas, also known as dusty plasmas, consist of ions, electrons and charged dust, tiny solid particles much smaller than the width of a human hair. Dusty plasmas have long been of interest in the astrophysics community, due to the fact that dust and ionized gas are found in most space environments, including the clouds from which stars and planets form, comet tails, planetary rings, and noctilucent clouds in the earth's ionosphere. Dusty plasmas are also present on Earth in applied settings. They are formed in the chemically active gases used in industrial plasma processing devices to create computer chips, contaminating the end product and reducing overall yield. Dust contamination within fusion devices is also an issue, since dust produced through erosion of the containment walls raises both safety (operating instabilities) and health (long-term contamination) concerns. The formation of dust crystals, clusters and strings in laboratory plasmas has also proven to be a capable analog for atomic and molecular systems. <br/><br/>Charging of dust grains is a unique and important aspect of dusty plasmas. Understanding the physics behind this charging and subsequent formation of dust structures immersed within plasma has proven to require nuanced details. The charge acquired by the dust grains is determined by the plasma environment, but the charged particles in turn influence this environment. Local variations in the charge, either over the surface of a single dust grain or the multiple dust grains comprising a larger structure, can affect both the grain's local dynamics and the evolution of the overall system. Many situations introduce asymmetries into this problem, making the charge difficult to describe analytically. Complicating factors include variations in space (due to geometry of the dust structure or of the plasma environment) as well as variations in time (due to the response of the plasma to the moving dust grains or stochastic charging processes). The dust charge is also extremely difficult to determine in experiments. Thus, the primary objective of this research is to determine how variations in charge in both time and space influence and respond to the dynamics and configuration of dust particles in plasma environments.<br/><br/>In order to accomplish this goal, numerical modeling techniques will be combined with laboratory experiments to provide a proper understanding of the processes governing the system behavior. Numerical models will be used to model temporal and spatial charge variation over the dust structures, including stochastic effects to resolve the variations in time due to the discrete nature of the plasma particles. The charging will also be linked to numerical models of the plasma environment which define the response of the plasma to boundary conditions and the dust itself. Simultaneously, laboratory experiments will employ state-of-the-art techniques to control and confine the dust within dust clouds, strings, clusters, and aggregates in order to use them as in situ probes to measure the local plasma environment."
0.449195,"Strong forces are responsible for the formation of matter as we know it, but the detailed understanding of the underlying mechanism remains a challenge in the physics of hadrons, elementary particles most susceptible to the strong force. The origin of mass and the patterns of resonance phenomena within hadrons can be addressed in principle using ab-initio simulations of the strong force. Yet the connection between simulation data and the physical world represents a major conceptual problem. In this context, this project will develop and apply theoretical and computational methods intended to support the experimental program at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and close the gap between observed phenomena and their explanation from first principles. The PI will also develop a computer programming workshop for local high schools and will develop a course at the George Washington University to provide undergraduates with the skills necessary to analyze data in physics and other disciplines.<br/><br/>The underlying theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), can be simulated using Lattice QCD methods on supercomputers. However, the small volumes probed in these calculations lead to numerical artefacts generally referred to as finite-volume effects. For the three particles case, these effects are not understood. As such, this project aims to develop three-body methods to enable the extrapolation of Lattice QCD results to the physical world and to help answer the fundamental question regarding the QCD predictions for the properties of excited mesons and baryons. The PI and his students will use the Faddeev formalism in the isobar approximation to addresses conceptual challenges such as three-body unitarity. Widely usable analysis tools, designed for minimal model dependence, will be developed and will be applied to the study of systems of high current interest, such as exotics, the X(3872), and the Roper resonance that exhibits notorious problems in QCD simulations."
0.745208,"In this project the PI will create a quantitative description of the ""gene regulation function"", i.e. the variation of the transcription of a given gene with the amount of its regulating transcription factor in individual cells. Specifically, the PI will quantify how gene activity, in the form of the discrete time-series of mRNA production events, is modulated by varying concentrations of transcription factors. The PI will examine three paradigmatic gene circuits of increasing organismal complexity, from bacteria to mammals. To perform these measurements, he will use a synthesis of traditional biochemistry and molecular biology techniques, single-cell fluorescence microscopy, advanced image processing and data analysis algorithms, accompanied by coarse-grained theoretical models and stochastic simulations of the underlying kinetics. A significant intellectual outcome of this project will be the first precise quantitative description of the gene regulation function at the level of individual cells, individual transcription events and absolute numbers of proteins and RNA, in genetically unperturbed systems. This mesoscopic description will provide a bridge between two existing levels of description: the molecular (microscopic) level, at which a wealth of information is available, largely through classical biochemistry and biophysics in vitro; and the macroscopic level of gene-network topologies, obtained mostly through classical genetics, but which lacks any quantitative details on the regulatory interactions between elements. The PI and Dr. Sokac in collaboration with Rice University will provide a one-week wet-lab based teaser course for quantitative undergraduates (Q-students) from math, physics, chemistry, computer science and engineering. The goals of the course are to show Q-students how quantitative methods apply to biology, and encourage them to pursue independent research projects. Q-students will be coached on how to find undergrad research positions in labs at the Texas Medical Center, and once placed, they will receive support from mentors and colleagues in a weekly evening discussion group run by the PIs. Ultimately, the goal is to recruit Q-students to careers in biological research.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.3,"To describe the interaction of a strong electromagnetic pulse and matter, one has to use the microscopic Maxwell equations with atomic level charges and currents obtained by solving the Schroedinger equation. The electron dynamics is influenced by the electromagnetic fields and vice versa, requiring a unified treatment of electrons and the electromagnetic fields by coupling the Maxwell and Schroedinger equations. Solving this on the computer is an outstanding problem because the simulation is inherently multiscale in nature, with the spatial scale of the electromagnetic field being determined by laser wavelengths of the order of one micron and the spatial scale of electron dynamics being set by the atomic radius and bond length of the order of an Angstrom. The main objective of this project is to develop a time-dependent simulation framework to describe the electron-ion dynamics and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in matter on equal footing using a time-dependent multidomain decomposition method. This approach is expected to allow the study of electronic, magnetic, optical and structural properties of materials in a unified Maxwell-quantum framework.<br/><br/>In addition to exploring new frontiers in simulations of time-dependent first-principles quantum mechanics to describe the interaction of electromagnetic fields and matter, the broader impacts of this project involve the training of a student and postdoc, who will have a unique opportunity to learn and demonstrate creativity in performing high-profile scientific research. This project will also involve a broad range of outreach and educational activities that include hosting high school teachers through the Vanderbilt Research Experiences for Teachers program, educating middle school students through participation in the Vanderbilt Summer Academy, engaging children in the community through nanoscience demonstrations and talks at the Nashville Adventure Science Center."
0.265,"This project focuses on a fundamental research challenge of modern nuclear physics, namely to understand the structure and interactions of the basic building blocks of the visible matter, protons and neutrons known collectively as nucleons, in terms of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong forces in nature. Nucleons, are composed of a variety of quarks confined by the quanta of the strong nuclear fields known as gluons. In order to explore the nucleon structure we perform electron scattering experiments where sophisticated particle detectors are utilized as powerful microscopes in order to determine the detailed dynamics of quark constituents. This in turn provides an important input for testing and understanding QCD.<br/><br/>This project involves four experimental activities, three of which will take place at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) while the fourth one will occur at the MAMI Microtron in Mainz, Germany. At TJNAF, first, a high precision measurement of the nucleon excitation to the Delta resonance will shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the presence of non-spherical components in the nucleon wave-function, with an emphasis on the role of the pion cloud to the nucleon dynamics. Second, in a separate experiment we will explore deep inelastic electron scattering off triton (2 neutrons + 1 proton) and helium-3 (1 neutron + 2 protons) mirror nuclei to determine the ratio of the up over down valence quark momentum distributions in a free proton, and advance our understanding of the effect of the nuclear medium on these momentum distributions. Third, a measurement of the J/Psi meson electroproduction cross section near threshold off a proton will enable us to explore the non-perturbative gluonic interaction between the J/Psi and the proton. This measurement might reveal an enhancement of the cross section just above threshold which could be indicative of the important role conformal anomaly contribution plays in QCD.<br/><br/>At the MAMI Microtron, the first high precision measurement of the Virtual Compton Scattering reaction on the nucleon resonance will allow the investigation of the electric generalized polarizability of the proton, meaning how stiffly the nucleon responds to an external electric field. The experiment will also allow for the first exploration of the nucleon excitation through a purely electromagnetic photon channel.<br/><br/>The project will enhance the infrastructure for research by building instrumentation for nuclear physics experiments, primarily at TJNAF, and by supporting international collaborative research efforts. The research activities will also contribute to science education by providing topics for PhD theses in nuclear physics, thus training a new generation of nuclear scientists. Furthermore, the opportunities for training students at the undergraduate level with hands on hardware experience will advance nuclear science education, which is essential to ensure a broad, basic knowledge of nuclear science in society."

0.23,"At the core of a successful undergraduate education in STEM disciplines is the capacity to offer students the opportunity to practice scientific inquiry that connects the use of modern technology to captivating areas of research. This grant supports a research program to study Heavy Ion Collisions at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) with the ALICE experiment. The focus of the Heavy Ion program at CERN is to understand the behavior of matter at very high density, corresponding to conditions a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, when a hot, dense medium of quarks and gluons existed. The goal is to recreate these conditions via colliding nuclei at very high energies. <br/><br/>Chicago State University (CSU) will contribute to the ALICE effort by working on two areas of interest: the jet physics capabilities brought to ALICE by the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal), and R&D for the upgrade of ALICE's central barrel tracking and trigger detectors. The physics analysis of J/Psi jets detected in the EMCal that is included in the project constitutes a unique program of measurements to investigate the production mechanism of quarkonia in proton-proton collisions and the response of quark gluon medium to jet energy deposition in lead-lead collisions. On the other hand the group's R&D contribution to the upgrade of ALICE will provide opportunities for the involvement of undergraduate students in hardware projects.<br/><br/>Recruiting, retaining, and educating science, technology, engineering and mathematics students and teachers has been identified as the cornerstone in the effort to improve scientific literacy, maintain economic growth, and to provide the platform for relevant scientific discoveries. This project addresses these issues by consolidating a high-energy experimental nuclear physics program at CSU: (1) The use of cutting-edge technology for high-energy nuclear physics experiments provides an attractive opportunity to captivate and prepare students, (2) A collaborative program at an international laboratory exposes students to research experiences they could not otherwise obtain at an undergraduate university. Because of the make-up of the student population, the location of the university and the current outreach programs of the department, this program has the potential to promote inner-city underrepresented students into STEM education."

This project will lay the groundwork for finite-temperature studies of nuclear physics by pursuing the systematic study of strongly-coupled Fermi systems and by testing this approach with related few- and many-body problems in atomic physics. The numerical methods developed here focus on nonperturbative aspects of the nuclear many-body problem and the results are expected to impact other fields such as atomic and condensed matter physics, high-energy physics and astrophysics.

These materials will address many 21st century topics of great current interest, and its plan does not correspond to standard curricula currently widely taught; therefore commercial publishers may deem it too risky to undertake, because the proposed work is highly exploratory. The materials will be made available at no cost. Funds are also provided for one or more workshops to help potential adopters learn techniques for creating interdisciplinary courses on this subject, as the PI has already done successfully at University of Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Both undergraduate and graduate students, both in physical and life sciences, need to know about the physics and biology of light.

0.21489,"This CAREER grant supports work on optics research to improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors and other precision optical measurements as well as using expertise in optics to organize and host a day of fun competition, the Optics Olympiad, for Washington DC high school students. Gravitational waves come from Einstein's theory of gravity, and are one of the few specific predictions of Einstein's theory that can be experimentally checked against other theories of gravity (like Isaac Newton's). Determining if Einstein's, Newton's, or perhaps some other theory of gravity correctly describes our universe is necessary to developing a complete understanding of the laws of nature. This experiment is being performed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) with two large, four kilometer long detectors in Louisiana and Washington state. Once gravitational waves are detected by LIGO, these detections will serve as another method of studying the universe, complementary but different from optical, radio, and other conventional telescopes. With gravitational wave detections, we expect to learn more about black holes, neutron stars, supernova, the origins of the universe, and other high energy astronomical events. Unfortunately, the effect of gravitational waves on the LIGO detectors is very small, and noise from other phenomenon can easily overwhelm the gravitational signal. This grant supports work to better understand and reduce coating thermal noise, a critical noise source that limits our ability to detect gravitational waves. The related education and outreach project is to pass on the excitement about optics we develop working on LIGO to high school students through a fun and educational competition, the Optics Olympiad. In addition to individuals and teams competing on knowledge and understanding of optics, there will be panel discussions, a guest lecturer, and tours of science laboratories at American University.<br/><br/>Thermal noise in the coatings of the LIGO optics is caused by mechanical loss, as shown by the Fluctuation Dissipation theorem. We will reduce this thermal noise by developing Aluminum-Gallium-Arsenide (AlGaAs) crystals and silicon nitride for use as LIGO coatings. AlGaAs has already shown lower thermal noise in other precision optics experiments under different conditions. Preliminary results with AlGaAs under LIGO conditions indicate some improvement in mechanical loss compared to current coatings, but not as much as expected. This may be due to surface conditions on the substrate, which will be explored using various chemical and mechanical surface treatments. The effects of these treatments on AlGaAs mechanical loss will be explored using normal mode quality factor, or Q, measurements. We will also better characterize and understand thermal noise from AlGaAs using the complete description of mechanical loss as the imaginary part of the stiffness tensor. This may allow for ways to improve thermal noise through the layer design of the coating beyond improvements from better materials. The Optic Olympiad will include a formative assessment to determine what elements of the Olympiad are helping to reach the goals of increasing students understanding of physics and optics as well as improving their impression of STEM careers. Results of this assessment and the Olympiad in general will be presented to the physics education research community, likely as a journal article or conference presentation."
0.537541,"This project explores the nearly perfect fluid-flow properties of a special class of ultra-cold atoms, Fermi gases, which are tightly confined in a bowl made of laser light and cooled to temperatures just billionths of a degree above absolute zero. The bowl is turned off to release the ultra-cold atoms into a high vacuum and they are imaged during expansion by laser flash-photography. By just turning a knob in these tabletop experiments, an expanding atom cloud can be made to simulate the behavior of electrons in superconductors, neutrons in neutron stars, or even an exotic state of matter that existed just microseconds after the Big Bang. The study of these nearly perfect fluids has practical significance in testing theories of high temperature superconductors, which will one day enable energy-saving power transmission, and fundamental significance in testing theories of perfect fluid flow that may have occurred just after the Big Bang. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to measure precisely the nearly perfect hydrodynamic transport properties of an ultra-cold atomic Fermi gas. Spin-up and spin-down atoms are made to strongly interact by means of a bias magnetic field, tuned near a collisional (Feshbach) resonance. A collision between two such clouds produces shock waves as the strongly-interacting clouds bounce off each other. Measurements of the shear viscosity above, at, and below resonance will enable new tests of the lower bound predicted for a perfect fluid using string theory methods. Studies of scale-invariant flow at resonance will determine the bulk viscosity and test general predictions for scale invariant systems. The experiments cross interdisciplinary boundaries by testing state-of-the-art theory for the transport properties of strongly-correlated matter, which can be simulated in these cold atom experiments, such as high-temperature superconductors, nuclear matter, and quark-gluon plasmas that are created in heavy ion collisions."
0.774959,"Overview<br/>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM).<br/><br/>The LHC is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator in the world and is currently operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. It is one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions.<br/><br/>Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) is the first experiment designed specifically to study the decays of hadrons containing beauty or charm quarks at a hadron collider. The goal of LHCb is to identify new physics in nature by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. New physics, or new forces, are manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered. These particles would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries, and thus allow new phenomena to be observed indirectly. In direct searches for new particles, the accelerators' energy must be high enough to allow the particle to be produced. In indirect searches effects of new particles can be seen even if they have a much higher mass than can be seen directly, because the effects are quantum in nature, and appear in calculations where the particles are ""virtual"" so they are emitted and absorbed over short times. LHCb has operated very successfully starting in late 2010. The data are being analyzed and published. The experiment has shown many results, but none so far have clearly demonstrated new physics. LHCb has proposed an upgrade to be completed in the 2018-2019 time-frame when the LHC accelerator will not be running. This upgrade will allow LHCb to collect an order of magnitude more data in decay modes that will either show new physics or severely restrict the allowed mass range. LHCb is comprised of about 10 different sub-detectors or sub-systems. The Syracuse, Maryland, Cincinnati and MIT groups participating in this award have the responsibility of upgrading a part of the charged particle tracking system. The intent is to significantly enhance the capabilities of this system above and beyond the requirement that data can be taken at an order of magnitude higher luminosity.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The intellectual merit of this award is that it is part of an upgrade of LHCb that will allow a much more sensitive search for BSM physics. The main deliverable will be a new inner tracking device, the Upstream Tracker (UT). This device will increase the data throughput over the current tracking device by an order of magnitude, allowing the LHCb experiment to probe BSM physics. The UT, which replaces the current tracker, will consists of four planes of single-sided 250 micron thick silicon strip detectors, read out by a custom-made front-end electronic integrated circuit. With its reduced material budget and optimized segmentation as a function of the distance from the beam line, it plays a crucial role in reducing the rate of fake tracks and in providing fast momentum measurements in the residual field of the dipole magnet. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The broader impacts of this work span several areas. Undergraduate and graduate students will be direct participants in the construction and testing of the detector that will be constructed. For many years a steady stream of undergraduate and graduate students have been working in the PIs' laboratories, where it is a tradition to ensure that graduate students have both hardware experience as well as data analysis capabilities. The upgrade work will be integrated into the Syracuse Quarknet program to involve high school teachers and some of their better students as well. Test results from this detector will be discussed at conferences and published. This detector is an integral part of the LHCb Upgrade and is essential for LHCb to continue to produce cutting edge physics results."
0.4,"Many areas in physics are entering an information age, with computation at the forefront of research. One of the key notions in this new era is the quantum-mechanical property of entanglement, which characterizes how quantum particles are correlated with each other purely as a result of their quantum-mechanical nature. The influence of inter-particle interactions on entanglement is a challenging question, as interactions (in particular strong ones) drive phase transitions and are responsible for intriguing properties of matter. Information-related quantities, such as the entanglement entropy, play an essential role in quantum phase transitions and are central to seemingly disparate areas, such as quantum computation and black holes. The PI will leverage computational progress in atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics to pursue a deeper understanding of strongly interacting superfluid systems at the interface between those areas, where entanglement properties remain largely unexplored. This project will provide precise predictions of entanglement and its correlation with thermodynamic observables across a wide variety of systems. Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged at multiple levels, with emphasis on an ongoing curriculum and track-developing collaboration with the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.<br/><br/>This project aims for a precise characterization of a wide range of strongly coupled, non-relativistic, few- and many-fermion systems of relevance to atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. The systems considered here will include multiple spatial dimensions, free space, harmonic traps, and weakly to strongly interacting regimes. Thermodynamic properties (static, dynamic, structural, and pairing correlations) and their connection to entanglement (entanglement entropies, mutual information) will be determined using non-perturbative approaches, including numerical lattice field theory methods as well as semi-analytic expansions (e.g. the virial and operator-product expansions). To this end, advanced computational methods and algorithms will be implemented and new approaches will be explored to calculate entanglement entropies. The methods (codes, scripts, technical notes) and the data (from auxiliary field configurations to the physical results) will be made available online."
0.35,"Achieving the control of matter at the quantum level requires the detailed understanding of many-body systems at the quantum level. This project is expected to enhance the understanding of quantum mechanical processes of fundamental importance, in particular the thermodynamical properties of ultracold few-body systems of fermionic atoms. Ultimately, understanding quantum mechanical phenomena from a bottom-up perspective will have important technological implications for a wide range of every-day tasks ranging from improved cell phone technology to improved surgical tools. Today's world is technology driven and requires a highly skilled workforce. This project will train the next generation of young scientists. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the project, and the analytical and computational skills that the students gain will prepare them well for future pursuits in industry and academia. <br/><br/>This project will advance science by developing numerical and analytical tools that allow for the study of the temperature dependence and dynamics of quantum mechanical few-body systems. Few-body physics has played an important role in the development of quantum mechanics from the very beginning. For example, the helium atom, one of the simplest atoms of the periodic table and an effective three-body system, has been instrumental in developing a concise understanding of electron-electron correlations as well as fragmentation and (auto-) ionization. The experimental realization of ultracold fermionic gases consisting of a small number of particles (two, three, four, etc.) provides a new theoretically accessible model system with which to study quantum mechanical few-body phenomena at zero and finite temperature. Moreover, time-dependent measurements can be compared directly with theoretical predictions. This project aims to conduct theoretical studies of cold few-atom systems. Finite-temperature calculations for trapped few-atom systems will be performed using an efficient and flexible path-integral Monte Carlo code developed by the investigator, which has been shown to yield reliable results for small bosonic and fermionic systems over a wide range of temperatures. The path-integral Monte Carlo code will be made available to the broader scientific community as part of the Venture Fund for Software Reuse program. Time-dependent studies will be performed using an efficient and highly accurate grid-based time propagation scheme that expands the time evolution operator in terms of Chebychev polynomials."
0.365694,"Under normal conditions, molecules in the air move at speeds of nearly 500 meters per second, and if they were not constantly bumping into one another, they would travel an inch in just 50 millionths of a second. This grant will support research on new methods for using lasers to bring atoms or molecules to a standstill within this same one-inch range, by producing decelerations a million times the force of gravity. For the case of atoms, the objective is to improve upon existing methods, by greatly increasing the force and the velocity range over which the force is usable. For molecules, it has proven to be extremely difficult to apply standard methods, owing to the relative complexity of the internal quantum structure of molecules. Thus a particular emphasis will be placed on effective schemes for decelerating and cooling molecules, using as a test system the calcium monofluoride molecule, CaF. Optimal approaches will be determined by a combination of numerical modeling and experimental tests using laser beams that contain light at multiple colors simultaneously. The resulting cold atoms and molecules will be investigated using lasers to probe their internal energy structure. The apparatus will also be used to study the interaction of molecules with each other under unusual conditions. There are possible applications to chemical physics, cold plasma formation, electric field calibration, and quantum computation. The project will help train and educate undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses three main motivations: to develop and understand the physics of stimulated optical forces, to achieve large improvements in direct laser slowing and cooling of atomic and molecular beams, and to investigate excited-state structure and dynamics in atomic He and molecular CaF. Helium and CaF are chosen partially for their fundamental interest, and partially because they are excellent candidates for manipulation by stimulated optical forces. The stimulated bichromatic force (BCF) and the newly-proposed polychromatic force (PCF) are rectified coherent optical forces from multi-frequency laser beams that can be hundreds of times stronger than the conventional radiative force. As part of the proposed research, a prototype chirped-BCF decelerator for He will be completed, and a promising new four-color PCF version will be tested and compared with calculations. A similar decelerator will be developed for the CaF molecule, a species that has attracted considerable recent interest as a candidate for direct laser slowing and cooling. For molecules, there is an additional advantage to utilizing coherent optical forces beyond merely increasing the force. Because hundreds of BCF momentum exchanges can occur for each radiative decay event, the BCF can reduce the velocity by hundreds of times more than incoherent radiative forces before the molecule decays into an inaccessible ""dark"" state. Several spectroscopic experiments will be initiated on the resulting cold atoms and molecules, including studies of cold gases of highly-excited Rydberg states of CaF, and precise laser spectroscopy of both He and CaF. The study of cold molecules in Rydberg states is a little-explored topic likely to involve new physical phenomena. Precise spectroscopy of helium will facilitate tests of basic theory and pave the way for future ultra-precise measurements. Novel applications of metastable helium beams will also be explored."
0.475,"In the quest to understand the fundamental structure of matter, most physicists have taken a reductionist approach by breaking down matter into its elementary constituents: electrons, quarks, gluons, etc. In addition to these known elementary particles that constitute the Standard Model of particle physics (our current best theory of the fundamental particles of matter and their interactions), there may exist more as-of-yet undiscovered elementary particles.<br/><br/>This project supports efforts to precisely measure so-called electroweak properties of the proton and of the electron in two large experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). Discrepancies between these measurements and the predictions of the Standard Model will point to new physical processes that are not yet included in the Standard Model. In case of agreement certain extensions to the Standard Model will be ruled out.<br/><br/>Precision electroweak measurements present a unique approach to test the Standard Model of particle physics at low-energy electron accelerators. Jefferson Lab is currently the world's leading laboratory for these parity-violating electron scattering experiments, and is uniquely suited to complete the ambitious Qweak and MOLLER experiments. The results of both experiments, by themselves but especially in combination with the results from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, will allow us to constrain models of physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The Qweak experiment started in May 2010 and collected data until May 2012. The experiment has performed the first determination of the weak charge of the proton with only 5% of the available data, and is aiming to make a precision measurement sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model with the full data set. The investigators will continue their central role in the track reconstruction, data analysis, and simulation efforts crucial to the successful completion of the experiment. The MOLLER experiment is expected to run as early as 2017, and will measure the electroweak mixing angle to a precision comparable to the best available high-energy measurements through a measurement of the weak charge of the electron. The investigators will take a leading role in the development of the track reconstruction detectors for the MOLLER experiment, and the development of a novel type of electron beam polarimeter based on Moller scattering in polarized atomic hydrogen gas. This new polarimeter will allow the measurement of the electron polarization to the required precision of 0.4% using a technique that will be applicable at other electron accelerators as well.<br/><br/>The investigators are working to increase economic and racial diversity in physics through specific recruiting efforts for the William & Mary REU program. The investigators are committed to increasing interaction between the physics department and the broader community through the organization of ""PhysicsFest,"" a yearly physics department open house, and through ""Saturday Morning Physics,"" a regular public outreach lecture series aimed at local middle and high school students."
0.179064,"Low-energy electrons play a critical role in a large number of fundamental and applied fields. They can induce specific chemical reactions which are relevant to dielectric aging, surface engineering, radiation damage, cancer therapy, and atmospheric physics. A particularly important process is dissociative electron attachment (DEA) involving electron capture by a molecule with the following break-up of a molecular bond. In spite of decades of experimental and theoretical studies of this process the understanding of it is far from complete. This is especially relevant to DEA processes involving molecular clusters, which are many molecules loosely bound by weak forces. The present project plans to theoretically study electron-molecule collision processes in gas phase and in cluster environments. The proposed activities will advance the theory of electron interaction with molecules and clusters, and molecules in a cluster environment. This research will create new knowledge in the areas connecting collision physics with chemical control, radiobiology and atmospheric science. The research will involve interdisciplinary efforts and collaborations with scientists from other fields. It will train students in broader areas including several subdisciplines. Examples demonstrating the role of low-energy electrons in different areas of chemistry, biology and environmental science will be incorporated in teaching.<br/><br/>The project's major focus is on the development of the nonlocal complex potential theory of DEA for polyatomic molecules. This theory would allow a proper incorporation of long-range interaction effects into the DEA description for polyatomic molecules which has previously been absent. These effects might cause special type of resonances, vibrational Feshbach resonances, in DEA. They were previously described in the approximation of one reaction coordinate, and the project includes plans to generalize the theory to the case of several vibrational degrees of freedom. In addition, the effects of the cluster environment on the DEA processes will be investigated by the use of multiple-scattering theory. Almost no information on these effects, experimental or theoretical, is presently available, although they are important for the understanding of the mechanism of radiation damage to biologically-relevant molecules."
0.126,"The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is on the brink of making the first direct detections of gravitational waves. With the improved sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, we expect to enter an era of astronomy in which frequent gravitational-wave measurements are used to learn about astrophysical sources. The inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars is a likely source for many gravitational-wave observations, and waveform models for the inspiral of such systems can be used to detect the signals using matched filtering. However, additional physics near merger is not captured by detection templates. As the stars coalesce, the gravitational waveforms will depend additionally on the properties of matter in the core of the stars. The relevant behavior is encoded in the equation of state of dense matter. Its effects on gravitational waveforms have not yet been fully modeled; while ever-improving analytic models in the inspiral and numerical simulations of the merger each contribute information, a complete picture remains elusive. This award supports a program of research by the PI and her students at California State University Fullerton (CSUF) to understand the effects of neutron-star matter on inspiral and merger, both by constructing hybrid (analytical-numerical) waveforms with explicit error estimates and by developing phenomenological waveforms which incorporate tidal resonance effects. The results will be incorporated into the public LIGO Algorithm Library for use in realistic search and parameter-estimation studies with the full data analysis infrastructure. <br/><br/>The proposed research is essential to maximize the astrophysical return on NSF's investment in LIGO. Improved understanding of measurement potential will inform configuration decisions as Advanced LIGO develops. Gravitational-wave measurements of neutron-star matter effects will potentially shine new light on the equation of state of matter above nuclear density, which is currently uncertain and a key research topic in both nuclear physics and astrophysics. This proposal also supports active involvement by undergraduate and masters students in the Physics program at CSUF, a primarily undergraduate Hispanic-serving institution with strong integration of teaching and research. Including students in cutting-edge research introduces them to the gravitational-wave science community, kindles future participation in science, and develops broadly applicable skills. The PI is actively involved in LIGO outreach, and will engage students, the University, and the surrounding community in the excitement of this new field of astronomy."
0.3548,"This research program investigates the intriguing physics of nonlinear quantum hydrodynamics, using ultracold atomic gases such as Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) as well-controlled model systems. In the experiments, clouds of atoms are cooled to temperatures near zero Kelvin, where their dynamics strongly deviate from the dynamics of classical particles and matter-wave behavior emerges. The wave nature of the atoms in this extreme regime leads to fluid-like behavior described by a hydrodynamic model. Capitalizing on the most recent advances and developments, the program provides much needed benchmark results for the development of a deep understanding of nonlinear quantum hydrodynamics. Topics include multi-soliton dynamics, binary quantum turbulence, multicomponent counterflow and Raman-dressed BECs. The experiments go beyond the realm of existing theories and provide strong stimuli for the development of a precise theoretical picture that is needed for future applications.<br/><br/>The results of this research program are relevant in a broad context. Strong parallels exist between BEC hydrodynamics and the technologically important propagation of light through optical fibers. For future telecommunication applications using solitons of light as bits of information transmitted through optical fibers, a precise understanding of multi-soliton dynamics analogous to the one found in BECs will be important. Second, Raman-dressed BECs exhibit spin-orbit coupling which plays a prominent role in advanced condensed matter systems, e.g. for the spin quantum Hall effect, topological insulators, and engineering of Majorana fermions with applications to topological quantum computation. Furthermore, the research program provides new insight into quantum turbulence and thus aids the development of a better understanding of classical turbulence, which is often quoted as the most important unsolved problem in classical physics. This research program also plays an important role for the education of students. It allows students at all levels to gain experience with state-of-the-art instruments and techniques while they perform experiments addressing some of the most pressing open questions in quantum hydrodynamics. The students will be well prepared for future careers in industry and academia."
0.12,"Confined ultracold atoms provide the unique capability to create designer systems that can be tailored to provide direct access to quantum mechanical properties that may be otherwise obscured. An important class of such properties is topological in nature in the sense that they are primarily defined by the structure of the abstract space of their defining parameters. Since topology is the most general description of any structure, real or abstract, such features can be used to find connections among phenomena that may seem unrelated, and thereby provide powerful insights into them all. The goal of this research is to analyze several such phenomena, some newly proposed here and some well-known but not well-understood, comparatively from a topological perspective. The method will be to recast them as generalized transport problems, tracking how the system and its parameters evolve in time, which will then be related to dynamical experiments with cold atoms. The study will involve the intrinsic quantum characteristic of phase in the context of creating gauge fields associated with varying local phase, and coherence effects associated with quantum systems. Whether the topological properties survive the loss of phase coherence in the presence of nonlinearity or in taking the classical physics limit is an essential fundamental physics question that will be examined for all mechanisms studied.<br/><br/>The outcome of this study has potential for applications in creating novel materials and devices that take advantage of the newly available topological and phase properties, as well as, for significantly broadening our understanding of fundamental physics, since many of these issues have relevance across all areas of physics. Some aspects of the research have technological applications potential for improved sensors and gyroscopes, and in the emerging field of atomtronics, the atomic analog of electronics. A high priority of the research will be to engage multiple undergraduate students at a public university attended by many first generation and at-risk students who often do not get the opportunity to participate in scientific research. The goal is to continue and expand on the success of a prior grant to attract and channel such domestic students into careers in science and technology."
0.21,"Quantum computers have the potential to solve problems that are completely impossible for classical computers, ranging from cryptography for national defense to face recognition and drug development. Just as the transistor is the building block of all modern digital circuits, the quantum bit (aka the qubit) is the heart of a quantum computer. Superconducting qubits, which are essentially artificial two-level atoms that can be designed and fabricated using integrated circuit technology, have emerged as one of the top candidates for realizing scalable quantum information processing. In order to perform quantum computation successfully, quantum computing circuits must be able to transfer quantum information rapidly among a large number of qubits with high fidelity. However, because existing protocols for quantum information transfer (QIT) are in general an order of magnitude slower than single qubit gates, QIT has become the bottleneck for quantum computation. Furthermore, conventional methods of QIT either require a large amount of on-chip real estate or have relatively low quality factor leading to lower efficiency and fidelity. Therefore, it is difficult to scale up qubit circuits to a practically useful size with these protocols. The focus of this project is to demonstrate the basic elements of a novel method of quantum information transmission in superconducting qubit circuits. This new approach uses ""dual-rail arrays of negative-inductance Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (nSQUIDs)"" as the information transmitting structures for significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art QIT protocols. The negative mutual inductance between the branches of an nSQUID assigns the two tasks of processing and transferring quantum information to different parts of the nSQUID circuit and therefore makes it possible to optimize parameters of each part for its particular task, so that much faster QIT can be achieved. The success of the project will thus remove one of the most critical roadblocks to building quantum computers. Therefore, knowledge and insights gained from the project activities can be readily applied to other superconducting qubit based quantum computing circuits.<br/><br/>Quantum information research has emerged as a highly competitive cutting edge research field which is actively pursued by all major nations around the world. It is critically important to national security and to maintaining United States' leadership position in scientific discoveries and technological innovations. This collaborative project between theoretical and experimental groups in quantum circuit physics provides a good opportunity for education and training of the graduate and undergraduate students in one of the frontiers of scientific exploration. The project also includes significant outreach and education activities such as improving the undergraduate and graduate classes in Quantum Computing developed with previous NSF support at the University of Kansas and Stony Brook University; involving undergraduates into quantum information research at Kansas; and presenting colloquia on quantum information at local high schools, colleges and universities."
0.522,"We will perform several measurements that can establish the properties of the high energy density matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions at both the Relativistic Heavy ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Specifically, we will probe the properties of this matter by studying the collective flow and jet quenching phenomena. In earlier work, we have shown that this matter not only exhibits significant harmonic flows of many orders arising from the density fluctuations in the initial collision geometry, but also exhibits strong jet-medium interactions as well as a response of the medium to the quenched jets. Our future efforts will be aimed at establishing a more quantitative understanding of the microscopic mechanisms for the flow and and jet-medium interactions. We plan to achieve this goal by finishing ongoing data analyses as well as by pursuing new measurements. They include: 1) Ongoing and future experimental and phenomenological efforts to constrain the mechanisms for harmonic flow and the nature of the density fluctuations in the initial collision geometry. 2) Future efforts to understand the jet-quenching response to the density fluctuations and to search for medium response to quenched jets. These projects are built upon our established expertise in single particle measurements and jet correlation measurements.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: These experiments will improve our quantitative understanding of collective behavior and jet-medium interactions, and hence provide invaluable constraints for determining the fundamental properties of high-density nuclear matter under the most extreme conditions.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Studies of high energy density matter can have a profound impact on our understanding of the strong force in nuclei and the evolution of the early universe, supernova explosions and the properties of neutron stars. The experimental results on jet quenching and medium response at RHIC and LHC have inspired important new developments in super-string theories. Both the PHENIX and ATLAS experiments at these facilities provide excellent training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students. In addition, the PI is also actively contributing to undergraduate education in nuclear science by teaching in the annual BNL Nuclear Chemistry Summer School."

This exotic aspect of quantum mechanics can be exploited to solve or model computational problems that are impractical or impossible to solve with standard, classical computers. This work will investigate the quantum behaviors of an otherwise classical mechanical oscillator, such as a diamond cantilever or a diamond nanobeam. The motion of the mechanical oscillator will be controlled through its interactions with an electron in diamond. These types of nano-mechanical systems have the potential to realize the exotic behavior of quantum entanglement and become a building block in a diamond-chip based quantum computer. This project will also make contributions to education and human resource by providing excellent training to graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the coupling between an electron spin in diamond and the mechanical motion of a diamond nanomechanical oscillator. The spin-phonon coupling will be mediated through off-resonant Raman transitions to the excited states of a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. Experimental efforts will focus on the fabrication of diamond nanomechanical oscillators, the generation of spin-driven coherent mechanical motion, and the cooling of the nanomechanical oscillator through its coupling to a single electron spin. The successful implementation of these efforts should enable us to pursue mechanically-mediated quantum entanglement between electron spins. The Sorensen-Molmer entanglement scheme, which is relatively robust against thermal mechanical motion, will be explored for the generation of a maximally-entangled spin state. The longer term goal is to realize a solid-state analog of the trapped ion system."

0.180463,"Observing highly energetic astrophysical sources through fundamentally different radiation channels will be crucial in order to better understand some of the most intriguing, even exotic, objects and events in our universe. Included among these are compact binary objects, composed of black holes and neutron stars, as well as gamma ray bursts and related phenomena. Such objects are powerful engines for the production of gravitational, electromagnetic and neutrino radiation. Many research groups as well as observatories and experiments (both planned and already in operation), are engaged in attempting to observe, interpret and understand these emissions. Their overall understanding will be enhanced and furthered as theoretical insight and predictions are used to aid in their detection and in testing fundamental theories and phenomena. Our purpose here is to systematically consider non-vacuum compact binary systems and to do so with sufficient fidelity to obtain their emissions in gravitational and electromagnetic waves. We will do so by incorporating realistic equations of state, electromagnetic interactions and cooling effects. In particular, our approach is to tie ever more tightly together our theoretical understanding of the possible components and sources of multi-messenger astrophysics. We will build our efforts on a strong computational foundation, namely a robust implementation of the equations of general relativistic, resistive magnetohydrodynamics with adaptive mesh refinement. <br/><br/>This research is of broad interest and naturally combines expertise and know-how that reaches beyond physicists to astrophysicists and mathematicians.

These waves will come from a variety of astrophysical sources and will open a new window to the universe. One of the most promising sources for these detectors are the inspirals and mergers of compact-object binaries (i.e., systems containing black holes or neutron stars). As the two objects get close, fully non-linear numerical simulations of the Einstein equations are required to make predictions about the final part of the inspiral and subsequent merger. This project will address several key physics issues such as: (i) How important is neutron star spin in the evolution of neutron star binaries? (ii) How can we best join a very long post-Newtonian inspiral waveform and a numerically obtained waveform from a compact object binary? (iii) Up to which frequency can post-Newtonian waveforms be trusted, and how does this frequency depend on spins and mass ratios? (iv) Can we obtain significantly better waveforms if we use more realistic initial data with less artificial ""junk"" radiation?<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Part of the proposed research will be carried out in close collaboration with the relativity group at the University of Jena in Germany. The planned research will involve at least one graduate student at FAU and one postdoc at the University of Jena. Thus the planned research will have educational benefits for the students and postdocs involved.

These processes play an important role and are essential to the understanding of combustion dynamics, astrophysical plasmas and plasma formation. The results can serve as bench marks with which to verify theoretical models of the processes. Theoretical models are themselves useful because they may be then conveniently applied to physical systems that are more difficult or more expensive to study experimentally. The amount of energy transfer arising from collisions between atoms and molecules will be studied by using two lasers. First, the internal properties of the quantum states of molecules will be manipulated by a laser beam. These molecules then oscillate like vibrating violin strings and collisions can alter their quantum properties. A second probe laser will arrive at the system after some time delay and sense this alteration. By varying the delay time between the two lasers as short as 10 picoseconds, time evolution of the molecular properties can be mapped out, similar to the way a stroboscope maps out the motion of macroscopic objects. These studies can provide exceptional spectroscopic precision and understanding of the various transfer processes.<br/><br/>This project provides understanding of energy transfer processes that are important in combustion and plasma formation. It has an essential and socially important educational aspect as well. This project integrates research components into course work at Miami University while providing students with hands-on laboratory experience with state-of-the-art technology. The extensive research training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students contribute to the future professionals entering science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields."
0.353318,"In this project the investigators will focus on development of biophysical models of multiflagellar locomotion in bacteria and use of the models to gain an understanding of the principles underlying locomotion phenomena. They will explore the parameter and design space, to help build an understanding of how the biological systems evolved to become the way they are. Principal aims include the development of mechanistic models for the dynamics of multiflagellar locomotion at a number of levels of description, and application of these models toward understanding various observations of bacterial swimming. In particular, one broad theme that appears upon examination of the experimental observations is multiplicity. Why are there multiple modes of bacterial swimming? Why do many species have capabilities to swim with multiple flagellar modes? Is one of the selective advantages of multiflagellar swimming the multiple possible configurations of the flagella? The proposed work will begin to systematically address this theme by building and applying models that begin to approach the physical complexity of a real multiflagellar organism, will substantially advance this understanding, contributing not only to fundamental microbiology but to many applications, such as soil remediation and prevention of infections, that are closely linked to bacterial motility. By shedding light on how bacteria swim, the proposed work will also strengthen the intellectual foundations for development of artificial microscopic swimming machines. The graduate students who will be educated during the conduct of this research will gain a unique combination of expertise in biophysics and computational mechanics. As part of the present project, in addition to participating in the proposed research, undergraduates will be involved in a K-12 outreach project involving the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.165,"Information processing devices, like computers, have become ubiquitous and indispensable in our modern life as an information society. A new promising paradigm, called quantum information processing (QIP), uses microscopic quantum states to encode information, and harnesses counterintuitive quantum effects such as superposition and quantum correlation called entanglement to attain drastic improvements over conventional devices. As the concepts from QIP start to be appreciated more in quantum many-body physics, it becomes clearer that nature handles quantum information better than we have imagined when it exhibits various exotic macroscopic physical phenomena useful in our technology. In this project we will study how effectively the intrinsic complexity of quantum many-body systems can be harnessed for the advancement and scaling-up of QIP. Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems, like frustrated quantum magnets, are explored as potential resources for entanglement available from large-scale QIP. This theoretical project is expected to cross-fertilize QIP and quantum many-body physics at their newly intersecting frontiers, and to help pave the way to larger scale quantum simulation and quantum computation.<br/><br/>The research will contribute to the knowledge base of quantum information science, and to the training of future scientists in this highly interdisciplinary field. Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results. The project broadens the current research spectrum of the NSF-funded Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC) significantly towards the interface with quantum many-body physics. Video conferencing is used to allow participation of CQuIC partners in the regular activities of CQuIC, including weekly group meetings and research seminars. All students and senior personnel will actively participate in the Southwest Quantum Information Technology (SQuInT) network, including the annual workshop. During its 15-year history SQuInT has provided a vibrant avenue for exchange of ideas and results in QIP, with particular emphasis given to PhD students, postdocs, and new researchers in the field."
0.444319,"This award to the American Physical Society supports the Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP), held annually since 2006. The conferences have two overarching goals: 1) to give undergraduate women the resources, motivation, and confidence to apply to graduate school and to successfully complete a Ph.D. in physics or a related discipline; and 2) to increase awareness by undergraduate women in physics of the wide range of career opportunities available to them. Regional conferences are held simultaneously to maximize student attendance by minimizing travel, to increase the excitement of the participants in a joint national venture, and to allow the interactive simulcast of a keynote address.<br/><br/>The project looks to evaluate self-efficacy beliefs, physics identity and outcome expectations of the participants. Through this research and the project evaluation, there is potential to gain new knowledge about the issues facing undergraduate women in physics, as well as how effective activities like these are. The project will advance our understanding of factors that impact the ability of female students to pursue undergraduate degrees in physics and have a positive impact on a population that remains underrepresented in physics."
0.46,"This CAREER award supports research at the University of Mississippi on the physics and astrophysics of double star systems containing only black holes and/or neutrons stars (compact binaries). These systems are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves to be detected by present and future gravitational-wave observatories, such as LIGO and and the space-based LISA. One of the main challenges in gravitational-wave data analysis consists in extracting the signal emitted by the system from the noisy detector output. For the extraction to be successful, accurate theoretical ""template"" waveforms of the signal are needed. This research will improve theoretical knowledge of gravitational waveforms from merging compact binaries using a combination of analytical techniques (such as the so-called post-Newtonian approximation and black hole perturbation theory) and numerical simulations. <br/><br/>The project will explore the potential of future gravitational-wave observations to test the predictions of general relativity, as opposed to alternative theories of gravity. It will also ""put more astronomy in gravitational-wave astronomy"" by investigating the astrophysical implications of gravitational-wave observations, and by stimulating interactions between the general relativity community and the larger astrophysical community. The award will partially support the training of one student and one postdoc in the highly interdisciplinary field between general relativity, astrophysics and data analysis. It will also support a long-term outreach program to promote scientific literacy and increase enrollment in the physical sciences in Mississippi. Outreach activities will target in particular historically black colleges and universities, as well as universities and community colleges in the Mississippi Delta."
0.75733,"This interdisciplinary project will develop a principle of nonequilibrium physics called Maximum Caliber (MaxCal). MaxCal offers a general way to make dynamical models, particularly where fluctuations are important, as in single-molecule and few-particle systems. This project focuses on developing better kinetic models for applications in molecular and cellular biophysics. MaxCal will be applied to analyze a genetic toggle switch, a genetic timer, a three-gene repressilator circuit, and studies of a synthetic genetic oscillator with activation and repression, the B. Subtilis ComK gene regulatory feedback system. A way to identify hidden kinetic states from single molecule noisy data will be investigated as well. The PI will iterate with his experimental collaborators to test and advance MaxCal, motivate new experiments and develop insights into the principles governing these complex systems. Thus this project will facilitate the analysis of the rapidly growing body of experimental data, as well as circuit design by synthetic biologists. <br/><br/>The principles of MaxCal have broad utility: from nano-structures and nano-motor design to modeling neural systems, ecology, vehicular traffic, econophysics and interstellar chemistry. The project will impact multiple outreach efforts and new centers for collaboration/education. Graduate students and post docs in the Laufer Center and in the University of Denver's MCB program will be exposed to MaxCal and the stochastic physics in biology that are under development in this project. MaxCal applications from this proposal will be incorporated in the NESM chapter(s) of future editions of the textbook (used in 150 graduate and undergraduate courses worldwide) Molecular Driving Forces that the PI co-authors with Sarina Bromberg. Besides training post docs and graduate students in this project, at least one undergraduate student every year will be trained as part of their honors thesis, a requirement in the department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Denver. The PI will also host high school students at Laufer Center to introduce them to university research, continuing the tradition he initiated at UCSF. The MaxCal project will also contribute to broader education by involving personnel from collaborators at the University of California, Berkeley; Arizona State University; and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The PI will make the computer codes freely available on the Laufer Center web server for broader usage.<br/><br/>This project is being supported jointly by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and by the Molecular Biophysics Program in Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.561853,"This project supports a CAREER program at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) to search for signatures of dark matter produced by possible new fundamental interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment. A key signature of a massive dark matter particle is that it escapes the detector without a trace, causing an apparent large transverse momentum imbalance. The unique contribution of this project is a generic, inclusive search for highly boosted hadronically decaying particles in events with large missing transverse momentum, giving rise to ""funny-looking"" jets, be they heavy boosted particles (top's, W's, Z's) or light color-singlet boosted particles (axion-like particles), emitted in the cascade decay chains of possible new heavy, pair-produced colored particles. This plan has the potential to shed light on the origin of dark matter and could break new ground in the search for new phenomena at the LHC. <br/><br/>The broader impacts are directed toward high schools in Chicago area, which use an active discovery format of teaching developed at the University of Arizona, known as ""Modeling Physics"", as well as inner city Chicago schools not using the ""Modeling Physics"" method. Together with the UIC College of Education's certification program in secondary science education, lesson plans will be developed within the ""Modeling Physics"" methodology that enable high school teachers to incorporate some of the latest and most exciting scientific developments of particle physics coming from the LHC into their classrooms."
0.127486,"The proton is a particle that is central to our understanding of matter in the universe. It is found in the nucleus of every atom and contributes to the fusion reactions that fuel the stars. Protons are constructed from basic building blocks of matter called quarks, antiquarks (the antimatter counterparts of the quarks) and gluons, but the ways in which these constituents contribute to the properties of the proton are not completely understood. For example, the proton has a property called spin, which is used in medical applications such as MRI scans, but detailed knowledge of how the spins of the quarks and gluons combine to give the spin of the proton is still missing. In this project the investigator will use theoretical models to study the contributions of strange quarks and antiquarks to the properties of the proton and compare the results to experimental measurements from facilities such as the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Undergraduate students will participate in the project, receive training in nuclear and particle physics that is complementary to their undergraduate coursework and gain experience in research methods and scientific communication. The students will present their work at professional meetings and to the broader public. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine the strangeness distributions of the proton and the contribution of strangeness to the proton's electromagnetic properties. Strangeness in the proton refers to its strange and anti-strange quarks, which are created by fluctuations of the proton into meson-baryon states or by quark and gluon interactions. Strangeness distributions describe the share of the proton's momentum that is carried by the strange or anti-strange quarks, which may differ from one another (strangeness asymmetry). Strangeness distributions are important both for our understanding of the structure of the proton, and because they affect the cross sections predicted for dark matter searches. The PI and her students will develop a meson cloud model to represent the fluctuations of the proton into pairs of strange mesons and strange baryons. A statistical model will be used to describe the strange distributions that are created in the mesons and baryons by quark and gluon interactions. Comparison will be made with experimental results for total strangeness and strangeness asymmetry. A light cone model of strangeness wave functions will be used to calculate strangeness electric and magnetic form factors, from which limits on strangeness in the nucleon can be determined from experimental measurements."
0.126,"With the installation of the upgraded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) nearing completion, we expect to detect multiple gravitational-wave (GW) sources before the end of the decade. The primary goal of this award is to help ensure that we understand the GW signals as accurately as possible so that we can extract the best science from the expected detections. To do this, the gravitational-wave group at Montclair State University will implement improved waveform templates focusing on (i) binaries with precessing spins, (ii) tidal interactions in binaries containing neutron stars, and (iii) binaries with small orbital eccentricity. These improved templates will be used to quantify the amount of systematic bias in our estimates of the GW source parameters. This bias arises from uncertainties in our knowledge of the actual GW signal. We will also test the effectiveness of simple waveform templates that will search for the GW ""memory"" effect. The memory is a non-oscillatory piece of the GW signal that is particularly evident in signals from supernova explosions and binary black hole collisions.<br/><br/>Gravitational wave detection provides a new and powerful way to observe some of the most violent events in the universe: the collisions of black holes and neutron stars. Observing these collisions with GWs will test our understanding of Einstein's theory of gravity and also probe aspects of nuclear physics that are inaccessible in terrestrial laboratories (such as the nature of ultra-dense matter). This award will advance the effort to model and understand these collisions with high accuracy. Much of this work will involve the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students. By applying physics, mathematics, computation, and critical thinking to an important scientific problem, these students will acquire technical skills that are in increasingly high demand. Black holes and general relativity continue to fascinate citizens of all ages. This award includes a strong educational outreach component that communicates the excitement of this field to K-12 students, undergraduates, and the general public."
0.057,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
0.23695,"This project will significantly improve our understanding of cellular information flow in the presence of complex environment cues. Cells respond to external stimuli through a cascade of events involving messenger elements that transduce information at diverse scales. Despite the progress in revealing individual signaling pathways, the fact that most signal transducers are shared by multiple pathways challenges our current understanding of cellular information flow. Compared to telecommunication systems, cells are excellent multiplexing (MUX) and demultiplexing (DEMUX) devices handling huge amount of information within an interweaving signaling network. In particular, as one of the most multitasking messenger elements, intracellular calcium engages in many aspects of cellular functions. However, existing models of information routing have either limited applicability in calcium signaling or may underestimate its information capacity. <br/><br/>Inspired by his recent findings of the calcium homeostasis during collective chemosensing, the PI hypothesizes that the non-linear dynamics of cytosolic calcium allows mammalian cells to encode complex information on both the single cell and multicellular levels. The PI proposes to test the hypothesis by studying the multiplexed chemosensing of a genetically engineered model cell line. As an essential step of the PI's long term goal to understand the physics of cellular information processing, the project will not only provide insight to the calcium-mediate MUX/DEMUX mechanisms, but also pave the way of realizing its engineering potential to build cell-based biosensors and biocomputational units. The PI will develop a diverse educational and outreach program that is closely integrated with the research program. Specifically: (i) Utilizing existing programs at Oregon State University (OSU), the PI will design a series of lab-based research training projects to engage female and minority high school students, summer undergraduate interns as well as senior undergraduate students working toward their thesis. (ii) Results and data generated in the project will be used to develop quantitative biology curricula to be offered at OSU from the winter term of 2014. This class is designed to discuss biological systems from information processing perspectives. (iii) Industrial outreach will benefit from the PI's existing industrial partnership and the proposed outreach activities, such as site visits and graduate student internships to disseminate the research outcomes.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.21947,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. This grant will support present and future experiments at Jefferson Lab to investigate the quark structure of protons and neutrons. In particular, these experiments will explore how electrons scatter from the proton and from other electrons in a way which will test the fundamental theoretical model of physics, called the Standard Model. These experiments will help to advance the field of nuclear and particle physics, as well as provide a world class education to the graduate and undergraduate students working on those projects.<br/><br/>In the electron scattering experiments at Jefferson Laboratory in which the Louisiana Tech group is involved, many new physical observables will be measured. The physics available from these measurments include measurements of inherent properties of the weak interaction, allowing us to test predictions of the Standard Model of Particles and Interactions, and in particular the weak interaction parameter. Additional measurements will further probe the internal structure of protons and neutrons, providing tests of predictions from existing theoretical models."
0.15,"It is well known that nuclei are made from protons and neutrons. In heavy nuclei, there are more neutrons than protons, and this gives rise to the theoretical prediction that heavy nuclei have an outer ""skin"" of neutrons. Measurements of the neutron excess in heavy nuclei also have applications to astrophysics, where objects called neutron stars are known to exist. The thickness of the neutron skin for heavy nuclei bears directly on the theoretical calculations of neutron matter and hence the composition of neutron stars. This award will support research on an experiment that will directly measure the neutron skin thickness, which is poorly known today, with high enough precision to test different theoretical models of neutron matter. A significant fraction of the research will involve undergraduate students from the Temple University community, accompanied by a recruitment effort that seeks to attract students who wish to remain in the city as science teachers. <br/><br/>This experiment relies on a large collaboration of physicists from a number of universities, as well as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Each group plays its part for a successful measurement, and this award supports a specific effort to precisely measure the polarization of the electron beam. This is the fraction of electrons, given one beam setting or another, with spins pointed in one direction as opposed to the other. The goal is to determine the polarization to about 1% accuracy, and this requires careful attention to a number of different details. For example, the technique involves precision determinations of magnetization of thin iron foils in high magnetic fields."
0.119356,"Particle physics seeks to understand the laws governing the universe at the most fundamental level. There are indications that our current best formulation of these laws, the Standard Model, is still incomplete. A promising route to the discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model is the precision study of decays of so-called bottom quarks -- elementary particles similar to but much heavier than the up and down quarks found inside protons and neutrons. In this project, the properties of several types of bottom quark decays will be calculated. This involves solving the equations of quantum chromodynamics on a space-time lattice using supercomputers. The results of these calculations can be compared to experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider and the future SuperKEKB Collider to search for signs of new fundamental physics. This project will provide training to students at the University of Arizona not only in particle physics, but also in data analysis and in supercomputing.<br/><br/>Lattice QCD computations will be performed for selected decays of bottom hadrons that have a high potential for the discovery of new physics, and whose theoretical description requires ab-initio determinations of new types of hadronic matrix elements. The research will focus on the following three areas: (1) Decays of bottom baryons, (2) Decays of bottom hadrons with multi-hadron final states, and (3) Long-distance contributions to flavor-changing neutral-current decays. This project will help understand recent hints for deviations from the Standard Model, observed by the LHCb experiment in rare decays of B mesons. It will also address an important puzzle concerning the smallest element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix."
0.68,"Accelerators were invented in the 1930s to provide high-energy particles to investigate the structure of the atomic nucleus. Since their invention, there has been a growing list of applications of accelerators both for scientific discoveries and for the benefits of the society. Approximately 30,000 accelerators are currently used to diagnose and treat diseases, to improve manufacturing processes (ion implantation for electronics; hardening surfaces and materials; welding and cutting; and treating waste and medical material), and to address energy, environment and security issues (biofuel production and oil and gas exploration; cleaning flue gases of thermal power plants; and inspecting cargo and improving the monitoring of nuclear test ban compliance). If much brighter (much more intense) beams can be produced via understanding the fundamental issues that govern beam intensity, the accelerators of tomorrow promise greater opportunities. This would require breakthroughs in accelerator science and their translation into applications for the nation's health, wealth and security. <br/><br/>With this award, some of the challenges in achieving much brighter beams will be tackled by the ""Innovations in bright beam science"" team at the University of Chicago. (i) A study will be undertaken to understand the science that underlies dramatic improvements in the quality factor of superconducting, radio-frequency cavities via nitrogen doping. This could reduce capital and operational costs. (ii) A proof-of-principle experiment for accelerators with highly non-linear components will be performed. This could lead to a significant suppression of the instabilities that have plagued intense beams. (iii) New mechanisms will be developed to produce intense X-rays, an indispensable tool for studying the atomic and molecular arrangement of materials."
0.31,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. <br/><br/>But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. There have also been hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos and clarifying these ""hints"" is one of the main thrusts of the work in this project. The work proposed here will be to further analyze data from the MINERvA experiment and contribute to the development of the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology for use in neutrino physics as part of the LArIAT test beam program and the MicroBooNE experiment. These three neutrino experiments are all located at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). The main focus for the period of this project will be on the development of the LArTPC detector for MicroBooNE. MicroBooNE is currently under construction and will begin collecting neutrino data in 2014, so a large focus of the group over the next three years will be on detector commissioning, calibration, and analysis of MicroBooNE data. This experiment should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether predicted ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments.<br/><br/>In addition to the contribution to the fundamental neutrino physics mentioned above, this research will serve as an invaluable proving ground for the calibration, reconstruction and analysis techniques that will be needed to make future experiments a success.<br/><br/>The Broader Impact in this proposal involves bringing current techniques in high energy physics to the broader local community. The south side neighborhoods surrounding the UChicago campus are largely populated with underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and this project aims to build a program within the Department of Physics that connects university students with local elementary and middle school children to introduce them to concepts in physics with the aid of fun, interactive demonstrations."
7.812136,"This research project addresses the question of the nature of galactic dark matter with a search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), using two-phase liquid xenon (LXe) Time Projection Chambers (LXeTPCs) as part of the XENON phased program. XENON100, building upon the success of the XENON10 prototype, represents the current state-of-the-art in WIMP search detectors. With a realistic discovery potential, XENON100 has already reached a world-leading sensitivity, and continues to accrue data at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy towards its ultimate sensitivity reach. To fully probe a particularly favorable region of electroweak physics for WIMP dark matter in search of a first robust and statistically significant discovery, the next phase of the XENON program will be a detector at the ton scale - XENON1T. The worldwide race towards direct dark matter detection has been dramatically accelerated by the remarkable progress and evolution of LXeTPCs. They have shifted the scale of target mass from a few to tens of kilograms whilst simultaneously reducing both electronic and nuclear recoil backgrounds to extremely low levels. The XENON collaboration has demonstrated the effective scaling of LXeTPCs with phased detectors of increasing sensitivity of at least an order of magnitude, and is ready to move to the ton scale. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding to the US groups for the construction of the XENON1T detector, cryogenics infrastructure and calibration systems. This experiment is based on a TPC with 2.2 ton of LXe viewed by low radioactivity photomultiplier tubes. By exploiting the excellent self-shielding and 3D position resolution of a LXeTPC, by selecting existing low radioactivity detector materials and by placing the detector in a large active water shield and Cherenkov muon veto, the overall event rate within the fiducial target of 1.1 ton is estimated to be over a factor of 100 lower than the background measured in XENON100. This rate translates to less than one event per ton per year in the WIMP search region - an unprecedented low background level for a dark matter experiment.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The XENON scientific goal to detect the missing mass in the Universe has all the ingredients to captivate the interests and imagination of students and the general public alike. The technological advances of this project can impact society in a number of ways: liquid xenon imaging detectors and related technologies find applications in several fields outside particle astrophysics, including homeland security and medical imaging research."

An educational program including high-school students, teachers and undergraduate students will continue. In collaboration with CEISMC and GoSTEM at Georgia Tech the PI and members of his group present lectures and hands on demonstrations on the topics of particle and nuclear physics and astrophysics. <br/><br/>The most powerful events in nature are usually transitory or episodic. Examples are the explosions of massive stars (core collapse supernovae, CC-SNe), high-energy emission by super-massive black holes at the center of galaxies (active galactic nuclei, AGNs), and the very energetic jets that power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This award will support the use of IceCube data to study very-high-energy neutrino astrophysical transients, including GRBs, choked GRBs and, potentially, still unknown types of astrophysical objects. The project will address two topics: a) Are choked GRBs related to CC-SNe and do they produce neutrinos? b) Are the sources of the astrophysical neutrino flux, recently discovered by IceCube, transient? Using IceCube data the Georgia Tech group will search for neutrino transients of one second to one day in duration in the 30 to 300 billion electron-volts energy range. The discovery of a neutrino burst with this search may reveal that CC-SNe and GRBs are part of a continuous class of astrophysical objects and that jets are also a feature of CC-SNe."
0.16,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary ""dark matter"" particles that do not emit or absorb light. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.<br/><br/>This award will fund an integrated research and educational program centered on the search for dark matter. Partnerships with a local minority public high school and the Adler Planetarium will genuinely engage students, educators, and the broader public in the mystery of dark matter and the status of current research, via regular classroom visits, field trips, mentoring, teacher immersion experiences, and in-the-museum programming. This will have a deep and broad impact, directly reaching teachers, planetarium staff, hundreds of URM students, and thousands of museum visitors (hundreds of thousands indirectly). The research program offers excellent opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate students, making them part of a cutting edge project in fundamental science.<br/><br/>This award will allow the PI to contribute to XENON1T, a direct detection WIMP experiment deployed at the Gran Sasso laboratory built underneath the Apennine Mountains in Italy (LNGS), in the assembly, commissioning and early operations of the detector, scheduled for summer 2015. The PI also plans to develop refined analysis strategies which are expected to enhance the performance of the ionization/scintillation identification methods that are exploited in XENON1T to suppress the dominant ã/â background. To achieve this goal, the PI will make a series of dedicated measurements with a small-scale xenon detector designed to collect pure samples of nuclear and electron recoils. This will permit an exhaustive investigation of the ionization and scintillation processes that govern low-energy interactions in liquid xenon. These data, which are not easily extractable from XENON1T directly, will then be used to increase the sensitivity to WIMPs through improvements in the calibration and rejection of backgrounds."
0.140297,"This project will study two aspects of gravity: (1) gravitational collapse and (2) gravitational radiation. (1) When an object's gravity becomes strong enough to trap light, the object becomes a black hole. Inside the black hole the object continues to become smaller and smaller under the influence of its own gravity until it becomes a point with infinite density and infinite gravitational field called a singularity. I will work out the properties of the singularities formed in gravitational collapse, and in particular the forces felt by any observer who approaches the singularity. (2) Just as the electric currents in a radio transmitter make radio waves, so moving masses make gravity waves. And just as radio receivers react to the presence of radio waves, so there is an ongoing effort to detect gravitational waves. One interesting aspect of gravitational radiation is something called gravitational wave memory: even after the wave has passed, there is a permanent change in the gravitational wave detector. I will study the causes and properties of this gravitational wave memory.<br/><br/>It is conjectured that the singularity inside a black hole consists of two parts: a spacelike singularity at the center of the black hole and a null singularity that takes the place of the black hole's inner horizon. I will study both types of singularities using two different numerical methods. Previously, I have performed simulations of spacelike singularities; however these simulations revealed the presence of structure with a very small spatial scale (called ""spikes"") that was not resolved by the simulations. I will revisit these simulations using the technique of adaptive mesh refinement, which should serve to resolve the spikes. I will compare the results of these simulations to those of an analytic approximation to spike behavior using what are expected to be the leading terms of the field equations near the singularity. I will study null singularities using a ""double null"" formulation of the Einstein field equations. Here instead of the usual foliation of spacetime by spacelike surfaces of constant time t, one has a foliation by pairs of null surfaces of constant null coordinates u and v. The Einstein field equations and Bianchi identities then become equations for the expansion and shear of the null surfaces and the Weyl tensor. I will perform numerical simulations of these equations to see whether the Weyl tensor blows up on (what used to be) the inner horizon of the black hole. I will study gravitational wave memory from a variety of sources using a variety of methods. Memory from neutrinos will be treated using the full nonlinear Einstein-Vlasov equations. Memory in an expanding universe will be treated using cosmological perturbation theory. Memory for the vacuum case will be treated in second order perturbation theory. I will also study critical gravitational collapse using a new vacuum axixymmetric code. In addition, I will continue, using numerical methods, my studies of Einstein-Aether theory, gravitational collapse in anti de-Sitter spacetime, and charged black holes."
0.137006,"The Otterbein University group of Nathaniel Tagg and his team of undergraduate students will conduct research on neutrino oscillations and interactions using experiments in the Fermilab NuMI and Booster neutrino beams. The research program includes the study of neutrino oscillations (in the MINOS+ experiment), measuring neutrino nucleus cross sections (in the MINERvA experiment), measuring neutrino velocity (MINOS+), and searching for anomalous events that might indicate physics beyond the Standard Model (the MicroBooNE experiment). A special contribution of the group and an exciting broader impact of their research program is the development and implementation of 3D visualization tools to guide the physics analyses of the experiments and to render visible to students and the public the nature of neutrino interactions as recorded and studied by the scientists."
0.13666,"Phenomena relating to microscopic (quantum) effects which occur during and after the formation of a black hole will be studied. The results will test predictions made using simple models in which the black hole exists in one space dimension and may provide insight into the important question of what happens to the information about how a black hole forms. If a system of very cold atoms called a Bose-Einstein condensate has its properties configured correctly, then quantum effects will occur which are in some important ways similar to those which occur for black holes. The difference is that Bose-Einstein condensates can be studied in the laboratory. An investigation of such systems will be made with the goal of making predictions for effects that could be observed in the laboratory. The validity of an important approximation called the semiclassical approximation that is used as a bridge between macroscopic (classical) and microscopic (quantum) phenomena will be studied in two cases. One is the effect of particle production on the dynamics of the universe for an important model in which the universe begins by contracting and later expands. The other is for the effect of particle production on a strong electric field. One or more graduate students and probably some undergraduates will participate in some aspects of the research, continuing a long history of their training in numerical and analytical research techniques and co-authorship on publications. <br/><br/>The research proposed will investigate questions related to the information about how a black hole forms; the existence of quantum effects in analog black hole systems related to the existence of a horizon, which can be observed in laboratory studies; and the validity of the semi-classical approximation in certain cases where quantum effects are significant. In the case of black hole evaporation the objectives include determining the importance of quantum effects in the interior of a black hole and investigating the details of particle production in the exterior region during gravitational collapse to form a black hole, in order to gain insight into the question of what happens to the information about how a black hole forms and to check the accuracy of similar calculations in two dimensional dilaton theories of gravity. For Bose-Einstein condensates, which can serve as analogs for black holes, the goal is to determine whether undulations or other new observable effects that require the existence of a horizon are predicted to occur. The validity of the semiclassical approximation will be studied for one important model (de Sitter space) in which the contraction is to a minimum size and is followed by an expansion. Numerical computations of the stress-energy of quantum fields will be made in the black hole and cosmological investigations and in the cosmological case the backreaction on the spacetime geometry will be computed."
0.069876,"A faculty member and his undergraduates at Central Michigan University were collaborators in the construction, assembly, and testing of the one million dollar Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) which was completed in 2004. Subsequently, the collaboration received a $1.3 Million NSF grant to construct the Large multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA). The MoNA LISA neutron detector tandem is used with the Sweeper magnet at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The main purpose of MoNA LISA is to extract masses of neutron-unbound nuclei and excitation energies of unbound states. The physics to be addressed is that of light, very neutron-rich nuclei located in the direct vicinity of the drip line or even beyond. This is the domain of very weakly bound nucleonic matter where fascinating new phenomena have already been observed, such as halos or drastic changes in shell structure. The MoNA LISA and Sweeper detection system is ideally suited to explore the intrinsic structure of near drip line nuclei by studying the properties of their ground and low excited states. It will also provide information about low-lying resonances located just above the particle emission threshold in nuclei at the drip line and beyond. Finally, the detectors are designed in such a way that they can readily measure neutrons in coincidence so that correlations between emitted neutrons can be investigatedin detail as well.<br/><br/>The MoNA collaboration is in a unique situation that is quite different from any other collaboration or research group proposing experiments at the NSCL. Specifically it first allowed professors from predominantly undergraduate institutions and their undergraduate students to participate in the construction of a top-level research instrument. The group has answered the challenge to transform from construction to production. We have built a unique analysis scheme that allows the undergraduate programs to be involved in the running, reduction, and analysis of MoNA experiments. As a result, 112 undergraduates have had the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge nuclear physics experiments. Additionally, Central Michigan University has aggressively worked to expose high school students and their teachers to experimental nuclear physics, and has even brought MoNA to Michigan state legislators and their staffs."
0.201,"This project will extract the lowest lying flavor singlet 0++ states in a model that could serve as an example of how electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically (technicolor). This will be the first analysis of flavor singlet 0++ states built from fermions in the lattice technicolor field of study. These are important objects, since they can be identified with the effective Higgs particle (sigma) or perhaps the dilaton of the theory. Obviously, understanding the mass of this state relative to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking, given by the technipion decay constant f(pi) of the theory, is of phenomenological relevance. We will also obtain an estimate of the width of this particle, which determines whether or not it is experimentally detectable. Based on studies of Minimal Walking Technicolor, the 0++ glueball may be anomalously light in the theory we propose to study; we will be able to extract its mass. It might even be able to be identified as the dilaton of the theory, depending on how small its mass is compared to f(pi). <br/><br/>The method used will be lattice gauge theory. To perform this task, we will extend the QUDA library (NVIDIA-based multi-GPU code developed for quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the nuclear strong interaction) to address SU(2) gauge theory with fermions in the adjoint (triplet) representation. On top of QUDA we will write software layers for simulation and for analysis. In the analysis stage we will estimate disconnected diagrams by exploiting dilution. We will also extract the glueball state by utilizing smearing, blocking and variational techniques. Our experience and software layers will enable us to rapidly take on other theories besides SU(2) gauge theory with adjoint fermions in the future. We will use clover improved lattice fermions with stout smeared gauge links, in order to reduce lattice artifacts.<br/><br/>Because our code will be made public, the scientific community will benefit by being able to use our code for other studies. Our analysis code will be flexible and in fact not tied to the gauge group and representation. Thus it can be used for studying 0++ states in other theories, including quantum chromodynamics. As a result, a significant outcome of the present project is reusable code with wide application.<br/><br/>We will train students in theoretical and supercomputing skills, providing a path toward careers in scientific computing. We will create increased interest in ""beyond the standard model"" physics at Rensselaer, broadening the exposure of students to current trends in high energy physics. We will perform outreach to a middle school, and develop lesson plans built around activities that teach concepts associated with our research."
0.232,"Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the Universe, they are keys to many astrophysical processes, and they may hold the key to explaining the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. They are known to occur in nature in three types, or ""flavors."" It has also been observed that neutrinos could switch flavors through a process known as neutrino oscillation. From such oscillation experiments, it is found that neutrinos must have a mass. This is the first known indication that there is physics beyond the very successful Standard Model of Particle Physics. Neutrino mass remains one of the most important open questions in physics and so experiments are searching for ways to determine it since with their abundance they could play an important role in the evolution of our Universe. Direct laboratory determinations based on the precise measurement of the beta spectrum have been expanding over the past 80 years due to increasingly powerful electron spectrometry techniques. In 2009, the PI proposed a new technique by which the energy spectrum of low energy electrons can be extracted. The technique, known as Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), relies on the detection and measurement of coherent radiation created from the cyclotron motion of electrons in a magnetic field.<br/><br/>Knowledge of neutrino masses has broad implications for the scientific community, particularly in the fields of nuclear physics, particle physics, and cosmology. The CRES technique, being a general spectroscopic technique for low energy electrons, has broad applicability. Examples of possible application include detection of rare radioactive isotopes for nuclear non-proliferation, Fiertz interference term measurements, low energy electron-atom scattering, and high voltage metrology. The PI wishes to target undergraduate student participation in such research toward underrepresented minorities, particularly toward members of the Native American community.<br/><br/>After three years of research and development, the Project 8 experiment has successfully demonstrated the first detection of cyclotron radiation from single electrons. With the proof of principle firmly established, this award provides continued support for the next stage of the R&D program, moving toward a neutrino mass measurement from tritium beta decay. In particular, the next phase is to make a first measurement of a tritium beta spectrum in order to determine the scalability of the technique. Such a direct measurement in the sub-eV neutrino mass range is important for cosmology, the structure of the new Standard Model, and it will illuminate a key unknown in the search for neutrino-less double beta decay."
0.1336,"Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary ""dark matter"" particles that do not emit or absorb light. Remarkably, particle physics theories proposed for other reasons predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with just the right properties to be this dark matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-based detectors. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.<br/><br/>The project will help train undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in a multidisciplinary field using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies with applications in areas of great societal interest. Furthermore, the project will support the preparation of Native American students for post-secondary education in science and engineering, with the goal of improving the diversity of the nation's scientific workforce through the group's participation in the GEAR-UP program at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish them from backgrounds. The high background rejection that the SuperCDMS technology offers provides significant advantages compared to other technologies, yielding world-leading sensitivity to low-mass dark matter and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment. To achieve the full sensitivity, it will be critical to reduce the radon-induced backgrounds of the experiment. This award will enable the PI to develop and implement cost-effective means to mitigate the concentration of radon in air, in particular for the underground cleanroom to be used for installation of the SuperCDMS SNOLAB detectors. The group will continue its leadership of SuperCDMS Soudan data analysis."
0.5263,"The present NSF grant primarily funds the RPI group's participation in the the physics program of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, where it is a member of the CLAS Collaboration. The experimental program's goal is to learn about and image the composition of protons and neutrons - generically called nucleons - which comprise nearly all the currently visible matter in the universe. Nucleons are composed of very complicated arrays of quarks immersed in the strong nuclear fields called gluons.<br/><br/> The main instrument used is the CLAS spectrometer, inside of which a beam of electrons from the Jefferson Lab accelerator impinges upon a target of protons. Most often the target is in the form of liquid hydrogen atoms. The experiments in which the RPI group are focusing are those in which an electron in the beam strikes and scatters off a proton and part of the energy imparted to the proton produces either a single photon (a quantum of electromagnetic radiation), or a single meson, which is a particle consisting of a quark and antimatter quark pair. By studying this reaction as the imparted energy and direction of the scattered electron is varied, the group seeks to obtain a three dimensional image of the distributions of the quarks in the proton, which has never yet been accomplished.<br/><br/> During this grant period the group will continue work on a new CLAS spectrometer, called CLAS12, which is part of the ongoing project at Jefferson Lab to double the energy of the electron beam. The component of the CLAS12 spectrometer on which the RPI is specifically contributing is called a high threshold Cherenkov counter (HTCC), which will be used to identify the scattered electrons. This is in addition to the more general role the Principal Investigator plays in the upgrade as chairman of the CLAS12 steering committee.<br/><br/> RPI is a technology based university whose primary goal is to prepare future scientists and engineers for the most advanced technological demands of society. The complexity of the experiments in this research require the development and use of the most advanced scientific equipment and computational techniques.

4.599575,"General Relativity predicts the existence of gravitational waves, but none have yet been directly detected. In addition to testing General Relativity, the discovery of gravitational waves will make possible new tests of theories that explain the origin of the acceleration of the universe's expansion and that reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity, two of the most profound challenges facing fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers (PFC) award the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) will focus on the detection and characterization of gravitational waves with nanohertz frequencies-frequencies eleven orders of magnitude lower than those probed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). NANOGrav will use observations of millisecond pulsars (pulsating neutron stars spinning with a period on the order of a millisecond) to search for these low frequency waves. The arrival times of the emissions from these pulsars will stray from their regular pattern if distorted by the passage of a gravitational wave. Correlating observations between different pulsars and monitoring pulse arrival times will enable NANOGrav to search for these low frequency gravitational waves in a way different from but complementary to LIGO. NANOGrav will also engage middle school and undergraduate students in their research efforts, including data collection, analysis, and characterization, as well as the search for gravitational waves in the data. The Center will have a targeted approach to increase student participation of women and traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The NANOGrav Physics Frontier Center will monitor the pulse arrival times of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in order to detect and characterize low frequency gravitational waves (GWs). In addition to known MSPs, the Center will search for new ones. Research goals and activities involve: the detection and characterization of low frequency GWs, including algorithm development, the study of electromagnetic counterparts to GW sources, and GW tests of gravity; the creation and curation of a GW dataset, including the creation of the time series analyzed to search for GWs, full characterization of the data set and its error budget, creation of a new, independent software package to create the GW data sets, as well as data mining and distribution; and the further enhancement and characterization of their low frequency GW detection method with increased sensitivity resulting from adding to the number of detection arms, characterizing their pulsars, and developing algorithms to increase the efficiency of their searches for new MSPs.<br/><br/>This Physics Frontiers Centers award is co-funded by the Physics Frontiers Centers Program in the Division of Physics and the Mid-scale Innovations Program in the Division of Astronomical Sciences."
0.6237,"The discovery of dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics and elementary particle physics. A broad range of observations from galactic to cosmological scales indicate that nearly 90% of the matter in the universe is made up of some new type of particle, different from ordinary matter. This type of matter has revealed itself only through gravity and is referred to as ""dark matter"" because it neither emits nor absorbs light. A leading hypothesis is that the dark matter is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced shortly after the Big Bang from annihilation of ordinary matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter then they will make up a spherical halo around the Milky Way and be detectable through interactions with atomic nuclei in a suitably massive and sensitive detector. This award will further the search for WIMPs by supporting work on the LUX (Large Underground Xenon) dark matter experiment that is currently operating in the Homestake Mine in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota. This award will also support development of the followup LZ (LUX-Zeplin) experiment, with a proposed mass of seven tons. The search for dark matter has been driven by the development of radiation detectors with ultra-low radioactive backgrounds. These detectors are also playing a role in neutrino physics, and have the potential for security, medical and industrial applications. Work on LUX and LZ provides excellent and unique opportunities for student training with technical skills that can be used in careers in basic research or in the private sector. <br/><br/>Using 250 kg of actively monitored liquid xenon, the LUX experiment is now at the vanguard in the search for dark matter. The upper limit on the interaction rate between WIMPs and ordinary matter that is now established by LUX rules out new regions of parameter space, and provides solid evidence that claims of WIMPs in the low mass region around 10 GeV are likely due to instrumental effects or unidentified backgrounds. With the next few years of operations and analysis it will become clear whether WIMPs will be detected in LUX or new upper limits set. In either case, LZ will be well positioned to follow up and continue the search with sensitivities 1000 times better than LUX's current limit."
0.359884,"Non-genetic phenotypic variation plays an important role in many biological phenomena. It is generated by a variety of physiological mechanisms and maintained by non-genetic inheritance with variable degrees of fidelity. Transitions between phenotypes are influenced by the internal history of the cell and the environment. The environment, on the other hand, can be altered by the population through metabolism and secretion of chemicals. Therefore, phenotypic variability and population fitness must be understood as a triad dynamical problem of cells-population-environment with dynamic interactions between all levels playing equally important roles. This research project will deepen our understanding of how non-genetic inheritance contributes to phenotypic variability in microorganisms and how variability affects the population fitness. This in turn will help better understand the evolution of such traits in living organisms.<br/><br/>The PI will study of the dynamics of protein expression and population fitness. Initially, the influence of growth rate and non-genetic inheritance on the dynamics of protein expression controlled by the LacO promoter will be studied. Based on the acquired data here, together with similar data collected by collaborators on the GAL system in yeast, a universal model describing how the dynamics of protein expression contributes to the variability in protein copy-number across a population will be developed. Afterwards, the dynamics of population fitness and its symbiotic interaction with protein expression will be examined. In addition, the influence of different types of environmental stress on the fitness dynamics and protein expression will be assessed using the LacO system as before and a second model system with engineered plasmids expressing antibiotic resistance. The last stage of the project will focus on the dynamic interaction between phenotypic variability and population fitness in spatially inhomogeneous environments, where the environment can alter the phenotype and thus its interaction with the environment and the population fitness. For this purpose, the sensing network of Escherichia coli will be used as a model system, with the ratio of the receptors Tar/Tsr being the phenotype of interest. This study will examine the variation in the ratio of the two proteins, and aim to: (i) measure the effect of growth rate and protein inheritance on the Tar/Tsr distribution, and (ii) study the dynamics of phenotypic variability and population fitness in spatially inhomogeneous environments. The experiments described above will utilize microfluidic and microscopy techniques, and will be coupled to a theoretical component that aims to develop quantitative modeling of the data acquired and provide predictions that can be experimentally verified. The project will integrate research in the interdisciplinary field of biological physics with education to: (i) Include high school teachers and students in research projects in the PI's laboratory and develop instructional material based on their work to be distributed to high schools in the area. Students from under-represented minority groups will be particularly encouraged to participate in this initiative. (ii) Develop biophysics experiments for students' undergraduate laboratories, and (iii) Introduce new instructional material focusing on applications of physics in biology into courses at all levels in the undergraduate program.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

The major thrust of this project will be to examine energy spectral cascades in spinor-BEC quantum turbulence where the flow involves both Abelian and non-Abelian vortices. Such spinor quantum turbulence has yet to be simulated in any real detail, particularly in 3D, and the novel algorithms developed here can be viewed as a mesoscopic model for nonlinear physics. This research is also expected to have a profound impact on plasma and space physics applications, as QULA will allow for the study of magneto-hydrodynamics turbulence and magnetic reconnection. The QULA algorithms are manifestly unitary and can be readily encoded onto future quantum computers.<br/><br/>The broad impacts of this project include the training of the workforce of the future, with graduate and undergraduate students having the opportunity to learn and work in an important field of scientific inquiry.

The recent first-ever observational evidence, by the IceCube Observatory, of high-energy neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources ushers in the long awaited era of neutrino astrophysics and promises to open a new window on the universe to provide information on the acceleration mechanisms at work in these sources and insight into the nature and source of cosmic radiation. <br/><br/>The IceCube Observatory was constructed at the U.S. Antarctic Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and the detector deployment was completed in Dec 2010 with initial operation of the full detector commencing in Spring 2011.

0.52,"Lattice gauge theory provides the framework to study the excited spectrum of hadrons. As such, this project will help unravel key aspects of the physics of quark confinement and hadron formation in quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong interactions and one of the fundamental forces of Nature. In fact, understanding the physics of confining gluons is an important intellectual challenge and was recognized as one of the seven so-called Millenium Prize problems announced by the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The masses of excited hadron resonances will be evaluated using Markov-chain Monte Carlo computer simulations of quarks and gluons on a space-time lattice. Results of these calculations are relevant to several ongoing experimental programs, such as the Hall B N* program and the GlueX experiment in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. It is worth mentioning that in the past such calculations were performed with unrealistically large quark masses due to computational limitations. The current project continues the development of a new methodology to incorporate crucial multi-hadron operators into computations in order to reduce the quark masses to nearly their physical values.<br/><br/>The proposed research incorporates the participation of two graduate students, and possibly one or more undergraduate students, so the broader impact of this project concerns also the training of future researchers in the field of lattice QCD. The students are provided with an unique opportunity to learn and contribute to an important line of inquiry at the forefront of nuclear theory. Given the high-performance aspects of this projects, students will also acquire essentials skills in the use of state-of-the-art parallel computing resources.

0.2,"With the detection of gravitational waves we are beginning to write a new chapter in the annals of astronomy and astrophysics, our experimental understanding of gravity, and our knowledge of the cosmos. This award funds the development of tools and techniques whose use can improve the efficiency and science-return of an important class of gravitational wave detectors, referred to as pulsar timing arrays. Gravitational wave detection via a pulsar timing array involves the accurate and precise monitoring of the radio signals from many different examples of a particular type of astronomical object - pulsars - over periods of many years. Gravitational wave detection via pulsar timing is opportunistic: we have available to us only those pulsars that Nature has provided. The sensitivity of a pulsar timing array to gravitational waves depends on the number of pulsars that can be monitored with sufficient accuracy and precision, and the relative direction of the different pulsars on the sky. The resources available to monitor the pulsars are limited; additionally, the available resources devoted to the timing of each pulsar can influence significantly the accuracy and precision with which it can be monitored. By appropriately choosing the pulsars that are monitored and the time spent monitoring each the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array can be maximized, leading to more rapid first detection of gravitational waves and a more informative scientific product from the effort. <br/><br/>Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are the only means by which the gravitational waves associated with truly supermassive (on order of a billion or more solar masses) black hole binaries, which are associated with the merger of many galaxies, can be detected. Observation of these binaries will provide important clues to the formation of structure in the early universe and the evolution of the galaxies that are observed today. The sensitivity of a PTA depends on the timing noise associated with each pulsar, the distribution of pulsar-Earth line-of-sight directions in the array, the cadence with which pulse arrival times are determined (i.e., is an array pulsar timed once every six weeks? once a month? once a week?), and the observing time spent on the pulsar at each observation (e.g., 30 min? an hour? several hours?). This project develops a set of quantitative metrics that can be used to ""tune"" a pulsar timing array to maximize its science return as characterized by three different measures - quickest detection, best multi-messenger astronomy prospects, and best characterization of gravitational wave source - and applies these metrics to identify what benefits can come from a change in the present observing time allocations associated with pulsar timing for gravitational wave detection."

The major thrust of this project will be to examine energy spectral cascades in spinor-BEC quantum turbulence where the flow involves both Abelian and non-Abelian vortices. Such spinor quantum turbulence has yet to be simulated in any real detail, particularly in 3D, and the novel algorithms developed here can be viewed as a mesoscopic model for nonlinear physics. This research is also expected to have a profound impact on plasma and space physics applications, as QULA will allow for the study of magneto-hydrodynamics turbulence and magnetic reconnection. The QULA algorithms are manifestly unitary and can be readily encoded onto future quantum computers.<br/><br/>The broad impacts of this project include the training of the workforce of the future, with graduate and undergraduate students having the opportunity to learn and work in an important field of scientific inquiry. Students will acquire hands-on experience on the use of high-performance computational platforms, as QULA scale ideally on modern supercomputers and the scaling was tested up to several hundreds of thousands of cores."
1.14,"The National Science Foundation grant to the Rutgers University Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics group will enable studies of the structure of the nucleon. We will study neutrino scattering from nuclei at the Fermilab National Accelerator Facility (FNAL). We will also investigate quark distributions within the nucleon with the SEAQUEST experiment at FNAL. We will participate in several upcoming experiments at Jefferson Lab with the upgraded 12 GeV electron beam. Finally we are preparing for an experiment to scatter muons and electrons from the proton (MUSE experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland) in order to investigate the proton radius, which has puzzled scientists in recent years because of inconsistent results with different techniques.<br/><br/>Besides the scientific impact, this work will serve to train both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral researchers, in the methods of scientific research. This training in fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers in and outside of physics. Our students and post-docs have successfully moved to varied careers in medical physics, homeland security, and finance, as well as continuing in fundamental research."
0.381027,"In this project, the PIs will reveal the physical principles underlying epigenetic regulation. Historically, the central dogma of genetics asserted that DNA sequence holds all of the information that orchestrates cellular function. However, histone and DNA modifications alter the physical packaging of genomic DNA, resulting in dramatic changes in the expression of the packaged genetic material. This notion of epigenetic regulation represents a paradigm change in how we think about genetic traits. In Thrust 1, the PI will develop a theoretical model to address the segregation of chromatin into transcriptionally active heterochromatin and transcriptionally silent euchromatin. In Thrust 2, the PI will perform experimental measurements and theoretical modeling of the reorganization dynamics of chromosomal DNA within Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In Thrust 3, the PI will establish a kinetic model that captures the function of the proteins that maintain and amplify the epigenetic code based on cooperative interactions with the proteins that control chromosomal organization. By combining theoretical and computational modeling with experimental measurements, the PI will establish an unprecedented level of physical understanding of the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. The PI's outreach efforts include the establishment of the LABScI program, which develops and implements teaching modules for the education of high school students that are being treated for childhood cancer. Future outreach efforts aim to further expand the program nationwide as a general laboratory science curriculum for hospital-school education.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.363042,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
1.0374,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.<br/><br/>This award will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies. SuperCDMS scientists will continue their involvement in public outreach, collaboration with K-12 teachers, and support for Berkeley physics majors who are training to teach science and for promising high school students from underserved backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award will provide support for the analysis of SuperCDMS Soudan, testing and characterization of the detectors and hardware of SuperCDMS SNOLAB, and scientific support during construction, installation and commissioning of the experiment. Finally, it will support long term R&D into improving the phonon and ionization sensitivity of cryogenic semiconductor detectors. The high background rejection and control of contamination that SuperCDMS technology offers provide significant advantages compared to other technologies, providing world-leading sensitivity to low-mass dark matter, competitive sensitivity to high-mass WIMPS, and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment."
0.14,"This project will explore how a specially-shaped intense laser beam can control the movement of electrons in a plasma, a gas of electrons and charged atoms. A beam of light can put pressure on things to force it to move. Normally, this force is too small to see, but if a laser beam is bright enough and the objects have a small weight, it is possible to see these effects. In this project, we will look at how controlling the shape of a pulse of laser light can make it easier for this force to get electrons moving fast. We will also look at how these laser pulses can make strong waves in a plasma, where the electrons and ions become separated by another laser pulse. Our pulses of light are so short (a fraction of a trillionth of a second) that the ions left behind don't have time to move. The electrons accelerate in the laser pulse like a surfer on a big water wave, where she chooses just the right angle to ride the wave. We hope to show that this can lead to a new way to make beams of electrons traveling near the speed of light. The work should also help us understand how we can use these laser pulses for making small channels and for eye surgery. It will also show us how to convert these pulses to other colors of light. <br/><br/>The research aims to explore using spatio-temporally structured intense laser pulses to control both ionization and electron dynamics in laser-produced plasmas. By controlling the transverse and angular distribution of the frequency components of the beam, we can control the spatio-temporal structure of a pulse. Important for this project, the angular spatial chirp results in an intensity envelope that is tilted relative to the direction of propagation. This gives us control of the transverse group velocity, which can range from super- to sub-luminal. We will use this control to affect the dynamics of electrons and waves in the plasma. In the free electron regime we will test our calculations that predict that with the proper pulse front tilt angle, electrons can be captured and accelerated to the side by the ponderomotive force of the beam. Such a configuration could ultimately be useful for direct acceleration of electrons to the MeV range, useful on their own or as an optical injector for wakefield accelerators. In the underdense and overdense plasma regime, the tilted pulse fronts can enhance the generation of waves in the plasma. In the latter case, we will perform a series of experiments to explore coupling of ultrafast pulses to surface plasmon waves. Our projects closely couple experiment, theory, and computational modeling. The experiments will be performed at CSM with our kHz repetition rate Ti:sapphire amplifier. Computational modeling will be performed with the open source 3D EM PIC program Epoch and with the finite-element Comsol Multiphysics platform."
1,"Particle physics is focused on the search for the most basic building blocks of the Universe and the rules that bind them. The recently discovered Higgs boson is an excitation of a Higgs field that permeates all of space and gives mass to the other fundamental particles in the Universe. Other fields, such as those that carry the electromagnetic and nuclear forces, interact with this Higgs field, and studying these interactions gives important insight into the properties of the Higgs field. Ironically the interaction of gravity - the force we are most familiar with in our daily life - with the Higgs is hardly understood at all, due to the vast difference in strength between gravity and the other known forces. The Higgs field may also interact with the mysterious material which gravitationally binds our galaxy together, and other as yet undiscovered constituents of nature. The CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider functions as the world's most powerful and sophisticated camera, observing collisions of protons at the highest energies humanity has yet achieved; recording the outcomes for detailed study by CMS experimentalists. The members of the high energy physics group at Rutgers University have been crucial to the construction, maintenance, and continued improvement of the device itself. They have initiated and guided several studies of the data collected, including ones that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. The data being gathered now and in the coming years will allow a greater understanding of the basic structure of nature, perhaps including insights into the huge difference in the strengths of the fundamental forces. The Rutgers high energy physics group will continue to be at the forefront of these investigations.<br/><br/>The Rutgers high energy physics group is carrying out several projects at the cutting edge of hadron collider physics with the CMS experiment at CERN, studying proton-proton interactions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, the energy frontier. They continue to innovate and implement new data analysis techniques in searches for new physics signatures with leptons, photons, jets and missing energy. The group has a history of leadership in CMS, including service as co-conveners of major analysis groups and leading efforts on detector construction and operations. They work closely with theorists to bring forth new ideas and a rich program of physics analyses and interpretations has originated from their efforts. They plan to continue this innovation and leadership to further improve the capabilities of the detector and data analyses. As the CMS detector ages, upgrades will need to be designed and implemented. This award will allow the Rutgers group to create an improved version of front-end electronics they designed for the pixel detector, as well as helping test and install the electronics for the hadron calorimeter. They are also performing R&D work on longer-term upgrades, specifically the Outer Tracker and a fast Track Trigger. They plan to host a production and testing facility for the upgrades. The Rutgers group hosts a large number of outreach activities which have a broad impact on the community. Through the Rutgers QuarkNet program they run summer workshops at Rutgers for high-school teachers and students. Students and teachers from across New Jersey analyze LHC data and build cosmic-ray telescopes. They mentor undergraduate students from Rutgers and the NSF REU program, as well as qualified high school students. These students work closely with the group's students and postdocs and contribute to ongoing studies and analyses. To combat the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, they are helping develop programs to provide research opportunities to collegiate and pre-college women, and working to increase the participation of women in science. They are active in promoting particle physics programs in India and Sub-Saharan Africa. After feedback from high school physics teachers, they are developing instructional programs for New Jersey high school physics teachers who need help teaching university-level physics courses. They are initiating outreach to the broader community with the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey to prepare particle physics related exhibits. They continue to convey the excitement of particle physics with frequent talks at local high schools, libraries, and other venues."
0.165,"A promising route to fusion power for electricity production is the tokamak - a toroidal (or bagel-shaped) magnetic confinement device that confines hot plasma composed of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. Non-neutral plasma, on the other hand, which is composed of relatively cold particles all of one type (either positively or negatively charged), is typically trapped in a straight device that uses a combination of electric and magnetic fields. Such non-neutral systems are used to store antimatter and also serve as candidates for quantum computing elements and next generation precision time standards, among other uses. The project at Lawrence University, a four-year liberal arts college, might be characterized as lying ""between a clock and a hot place,"" as it uses a toroidal magnetic field (like the tokamak) to confine and study a pure electron (i.e., non-neutral) plasma. The apparatus, which was designed and constructed with prior NSF/DOE support, is uniquely positioned to explore untested fundamental aspects of the physics of charged particle collections in a curved and non-uniform magnetic field that closes on itself. <br/><br/>The project will provide research experiences (as well as scientific authorship and presentation opportunities) for undergraduate students. Undergraduate research experiences in this small college environment tend to provide more comprehensive research skills training than comparable experiences at larger institutions, thereby contributing in significant ways to developing the future workforce in technical fields. Thanks to Lawrence's success in attracting women physics majors (27% of the physics graduates in the last 5 years) and increasing minority enrollment in the university (145% increase since 2000), the research will positively impact the engagement of underrepresented groups in the physics PhD pipeline. The apparatus will also be used to recruit promising high school students to the Lawrence University physics program and expose the campus and local communities to the subject of plasma physics."
0.389781,"The generation of well-collimated (i.e., bright) pulsed electron beams is a key component in many of todays (and proposed future) cutting edge research instruments aimed at improving our understanding of materials, nanoscale systems, and molecular dynamics on fast timescales and with high spatial resolution. This research project will build on and verify our recently developed theoretical formalism describing how the characteristics of these electron pulses are fundamentally dependent upon the electronic properties of the electron-emitting (photocathode) material, with the goal of significantly increasing their brightness. The consequent expected enhancement in the performance of the related research instrumentation (such as the Linac Coherent Light Source and electron microscopes incorporating fast time resolution) should result in tangible scientific advances, particularly in the strategically important fields of sustainable energy research, molecular biochemistry, and materials engineering. In addition to educating the next generation of leaders in accelerator science, condensed matter physics, and photonics, this project will also expose STEM undergraduate students to highly interdisciplinary modern research work. <br/><br/>The goal of this three-year research project is to improve substantially the beam quality of laser-driven electron sources using a band structure based photoemission theory to identify robust planar photocathode materials that generate electron beams with ultra-low divergence. Prior combined experimental and theoretical work has provided the framework for a deeper understanding of the physics of planar photocathodes that will now allow for a predictive approach to photocathode selection. After experimental verification of the density functional theory (DFT) approach to the simulation of photoemission using single-crystal metals, further studies will be conducted on photocathode materials selected for their substantially reduced electron beam divergence associated with expected low values of the rms transverse momentum, pT, of the emitted electrons. Assessment of the theoretical predictions will employ the solenoid scan technique to measure pT of electron beams generated using a laser-driven DC electron gun. All experiments will be performed using a custom-built, 230-300nm tunable ultraviolet laser radiation source to allow in situ verification of the work function and the predicted spectral dependence of quantitative photocathode properties, including quantum emission efficiency. This will also require an extension to the DFT-based photoemission theory to include finite temperature effects and matrix elements describing the photoexcitation in the photocathode material. In addition, an investigation into the important effect of surface roughness on the emission properties of planar metal and semiconductor photocathodes with and without direct one-step photoexcited bulk state emission will be initiated."
0.6,"Gravitational waves are the messenger that will tell us about some of the most highly energetic events in the universe, in this case the coherent motion of very heavy masses undergoing high acceleration; such large masses can be found in black holes, the merger of neutron star binary systems, supernovae, and the echoes of the big bang. The discovery of gravitational waves as well as the discovery of these sources with Advanced LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory built by the National Science Foundation to make a direct detection of gravitational waves, would be a major milestone in the history of science. Advanced LIGO encompasses an extremely diverse array of underlying scientific and engineering disciplines: examples include lasers, optics, low noise electronics, control systems, grid computing, algorithm development, and handling large data sets. <br/><br/>The Advanced LIGO interferometers have turned on and commissioning of them has increased their sensitivity far above previous detectors. The goal of a tenfold sensitivity improvement is in sight. Because the search volume scales as distance cubed, advanced LIGO will have more than 1000 times more sources within its reach. To achieve this improved sensitivity, essentially everything except for the vacuum system has been replaced. This includes the use of a 180 Watt laser, quadruple pendulum suspensions, 40 kilogram test masses, active seismic platforms, a signal-recycled interferometer, stable recycling cavities, an output mode cleaner, DC readout, and improved thermal compensation. The higher laser power presents challenges for the input optics, a responsibility of the University of Florida. Moreover, this research has impacts that go beyond gravitational wave science. High-power optical devices developed in this project have commercial applications in the laser and optics industries.<br/><br/>This project will address items that could be needed in order to optimize the performance of the detector. It also addresses basic research needed for future upgrades and next generation detectors, which will further increase the science reach of the observatories as well as work on detector characterization. Simulations of the interferometers will be carried out to aid commissioning work. Work on thermal adaptive mode-matching and devices for beam-jitter suppression will be done. A novel scheme for sensing alignment errors will be modeled and prototyped. Thermal coating noise as a function of temperature will be measured. Looking further into the future, experiments to measure impurities and free carrier absorption in high purity silicon for test masses will be conducted. Considerable effort will be put towards improving the bidirectional throughput of Faraday isolators that are key components of a squeezer for future detectors."
0.3,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. A primary area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another, i.e. oscillate. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This particular project will focus on the study of the oscillations of the neutrinos between different types. The award will support the work of one post-doctoral researcher as well as graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This award supports work, using the neutrino beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), on the neutrino experiments: MINERvA and MicroBooNE, both measuring neutrino oscillations: muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions. These oscillations are of great interest to the scientific community since they could show indications of BSM physics. To correctly measure these transitions, precise knowledge of neutrino interactions with nuclei is required. This award will be used to measure these interactions across a wide energy range available at FNAL, which will be beneficial for both neutrino and nuclear physics. This will improve our knowledge of the neutrino flux, useful for future Short Baseline (detector near the source at FNAL) and Long Baseline (detector hundreds of kilometers away)."
0.36,"Observing highly energetic astrophysical sources through fundamentally different radiation channels will be crucial in order to better understand some of the most intriguing, even exotic, objects and events in our universe. Included among these are compact binary objects, composed of black holes and neutron stars, as well as gamma ray bursts and related phenomena. Such objects are powerful engines for the production of gravitational, electromagnetic and neutrino radiation. Many research groups as well as observatories and experiments (both planned and already in operation), are engaged in attempting to observe, interpret and understand these emissions. Their overall understanding will be enhanced and furthered as theoretical insight and predictions are used to aid in their detection and in testing fundamental theories and phenomena. Our purpose here is to systematically consider non-vacuum compact binary systems and to do so with sufficient fidelity to obtain their emissions in gravitational and electromagnetic waves. We will do so by incorporating realistic equations of state, electromagnetic interactions and cooling effects. In particular, our approach is to tie ever more tightly together our theoretical understanding of the possible components and sources of multi-messenger astrophysics. We will build our efforts on a strong computational foundation, namely a robust implementation of the equations of general relativistic, resistive magnetohydrodynamics with adaptive mesh refinement. <br/><br/>This research is of broad interest and naturally combines expertise and know-how that reaches beyond physicists to astrophysicists and mathematicians. It will advance our understanding of some of the most intriguing processes in the universe, and will provide valuable candidate waveforms for gravitational wave observatories (e.g. LIGO). Our participation in multinational efforts to compare waveforms and approaches will be especially valuable to the gravitational wave and astrophysical communities. The activities described here will help further undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research and training, including a number of underrepresented individuals. Also, this work uses the HAD infrastructure and thus helps support broadly useful, publicly released, software. Additionally, this research involves some of the most exotic objects in our universe that captures the imagination of the general public."
0.125997,"We will investigate extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) of compact objects in orbit around super-massive black holes that, due to emission of gravitational waves, eventually plunge into the super-massive black hole. We will generalize existing methods based on the effective source approach from the scalar case to the more interesting (and demanding) gravitational case with the aim of being able to perform fully self-consistent evolutions of both the particle trajectory and the radiation field. EMRIs are expected to be a major source of gravitational waves for future space-based gravitational wave detectors. The observation of such events can be used to test the black hole No-Hair Theorem by mapping out the black hole metric as the small compact object spirals in. However, a successful test will require very accurate predictions of the full gravitational waveform with small phase errors over hundreds of thousands to millions of orbital periods. The slow orbital evolution is determined by the interaction of the particle with the perturbations produced by the particle itself, the so called self-force. Though the radiative part of the self-force is solely responsible for the evolution of the orbital parameters resulting in amplitude and frequency evolution of the waveform, the conservative piece can still affect the phase. Current approaches to calculating EMRI waveforms evolve the system as if it were going from one geodesic to the next. The change of the orbital parameters is calculated from averages of fluxes or the self-force itself over several orbits. The approximate methods have to be checked with fully self-consistent evolutions of both the orbit and gravitational perturbations. Using the effective source approach, such self-consistent evolutions are now within reach.<br/><br/>This project will leverage and integrate with several complementary NSF projects which focus on developing open-source codes and building research communities across many fields of science. Within these communities, this project will broaden the existing infrastructure and computational methods and make them available not only to our group but to the broader self-force community. A central part of this proposal is the training of a graduate student. The student will be integrated into both the numerical relativity group at LSU and the international self-force community. PI Diener participates in two REU programs at LSU (one at the CCT, one in the physics department)<br/>where undergraduates gain research experience in computational relativistic astrophysics using real production code via simple user interfaces developed in the Cactus group at the CCT. In the coming years the REU research projects will be based on this project."
0.254994,"We study the interaction of attosecond pulses, which last for less than one femtosecond, with matter. In particular, we study the interaction of short (ultraviolet) wavelength (ultraviolet) attosecond pulses with matter subjected to a delayed laser pulse with a much longer (near infrared) wavelength. These near-infrared-extreme untraviolet (nir-xuv) pulse pairs are automatically available when attosecond radiation is made by the strong &#64257;eld process of high harmonic generation. These two-color pulse pairs have a wide variety of uses, from attosecond metrology to the control of strong &#64257;eld processes such as multiphoton ionization. The short duration of the pulses and the strength of the applied &#64257;elds dictate that accurate calculations require a nonperturbative solution of the laser-matter interaction, which we achieve by direct integration of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The work is directly relevant to ongoing collaborations between the principle investigator and experimental groups at the forefront of strong &#64257;eld physics and attosecond science.<br/><br/>Attosecond light allows us to study and manipulate atomic, molecular and biological processes at sub-femtosecond time scales, yielding new ways to understand and control matter via its interaction with light. The basic research on attosecond physics supported by this project will broaden the U.S. knowledge base on attosecond science. The research will result in the training of graduate students and postdoctoral research associates in the interdisciplinary &#64257;eld of atomic, molecular and optical science. They will gain a broad education in both atomic physics and high intensity laser science, and a thorough understanding of both the theoretical and experimental issues involved. They will also receive training in advanced numerical simulations, with applications to a wide variety of problems in government and industry. The research topics supported by the grant will be incorporated into the PI's teaching of time-dependent quantum dynamics at both the undergraduate and graduate levels."
0.968451,"When the Pierre Auger Project was proposed in 1998 the stated scientific objective was ""to discover and understand the source or sources of cosmic rays with energies exceeding 10**19 eV."" A unique partnership of 17 countries has come together to pursue this science. The Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO), completed in June 2008, has accumulated data since January of 2004, and has already yielded results that are the first crucial steps toward those scientific goals. <br/><br/>The growing Auger data set will address vital questions in astrophysics and particle physics. The PAO will continue to map the southern sky to strengthen the correlation of the highest energy events with extragalactic sources. A continuously enriched sample of hybrid events with measured longitudinal development will improve our understanding of the cosmic ray composition and features of particle interactions from LHC energies to those well beyond. Resolving the puzzle of apparent excess of muons will benefit from increasing statistics. A precise spectrum measurement in the ankle region with the help of the AMIGA in-fill and the HEAT high elevation telescopes will help determine the transition from galactic to extragalactic sources. Based on hints in the data the search for galactic sources of neutrons and photons may well be fruitful. Finally a search for EeV neutrinos will continue to be of great interest.<br/><br/>This award will provide partial funding for the continuing operation of the PAO in Argentina. Collaborating countries fund the operations of the Observatory in proportion to the number of senior authors they have on Auger science publications. The US portion of these operating costs is being shared equally by the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy.<br/><br/>The study of the highest energy cosmic rays, the most energetic particles in nature, will have broader impacts on the understanding of particle physics at the highest energies as well as astrophysics.

0.088085,"This award will enable collaborative work by Duke University and the University of Minnesota Duluth's neutrino research groups on the Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO). This is a new experiment designed to detect neutrinos originating in a core-collapse supernova within our own galaxy. The deaths of massive stars which cause these cataclysmic events occur every few decades somewhere in the MilkyWay and emit 99% of their energy in the form of a short burst of neutrinos. Existing detectors are primarily sensitive to electron antineutrinos. Use of lead for its target nuclei allows HALO to be sensitive to electron neutrinos, as well as to all flavor components of the burst flux via neutral current interactions. The effort for this funding cycle will center on upgrading HALO with redundant, fast-failover data acquisition systems. This award will provide modest hardware and personnel contributions to this effort.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this award include the excellent experimental training for students and postdoctoral researchers. They have been very successful in involving students and postdocs in the past. This project offers a range of experiences, from simulation through detector construction, with operations and data analysis to commence soon.

0.900048,"This award supports tabletop experiments to study methods for mitigating quantum noise in gravitational-wave interferometers. An experimental setup limited by both radiation pressure and shot noise in a low noise cryogenic environment will be developed. To achieve this in a small scale prototype, micro-fabricated mechanical resonators (of order 100 nanograms) will be used as one mirror of a high finesse optical cavity inside a low vibration cryostat, cooled to below 10K. A series of experiments will then be performed to verify models of quantum noise, and to test methods for its reduction. Specifically, a homodyne detector will be used to perform a variational readout of the resonator's position, to exploit the ponderomotive squeezing, and to evade the radiation pressure noise at a single frequency. A filter cavity will then be introduced to evade the radiation pressure noise in a wide frequency band. Advanced LIGO and other second generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to be limited by quantum noise across the majority of their detection frequency band. At low frequencies, the test masses are driven by radiation pressure and at high frequencies, shot noise limits the phase precision of the measurement. Together, the radiation pressure and shot noise represent a significant limit on the sensitivities of future gravitational-wave detectors. Collaboration with other groups within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration will provide access to a source of squeezed vacuum states, which will be used to directly reduce the radiation pressure noise. Alternative topologies, such as the speedmeter and dual-carrier readout, will also be explored. By using a combination of optical trapping and cooling, the mechanical resonators will be placed into low noise states, with decoherence rates less than their oscillation frequency, allowing for the resonators to be placed in non-classical states, as a test of quantum mechanics. <br/><br/>This research program will substantially enhance the on-campus research activities of the experimental gravitational physics program at Louisiana State University. Because of LSU's proximity to the LIGO Livingston Observatory, and the PI's other research activities within the LIGO project, there will be substantial personnel and intellectual overlap between LIGO commissioning, other on-site work, and R&D activities. Integration among these activities will strengthen the LIGO project and reduce risk, as well as advance the frontier of gravitational-wave science. Students and post-docs with experience in both small scale lab experiments and large scientific collaborations will be trained. The nature of this work naturally leads to collaboration between the GW community and the fields of quantum optics and quantum information. The thermal noise characterization experiments will have wide ranging applications to many systems limited by thermal noise. A summer research and education program aimed at undergraduate juniors will be developed, with the goal of encouraging and helping underrepresented groups in the region enter and succeed in graduate school within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. This program will contain both a research and an education component, and will work strongly with existing programs including the LIGO Science Education Center, Southern University Baton Rouge's Timbuktu Academy, and the outreach group in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to develop the educational program and to attract students."

0.125,"The next few years will be very exciting in gravitational wave physics. In 2015-18, the Advanced LIGO detectors will produce data in the first Observing Runs, with increasing sensitivity and likelihood of the first direct detection of the gravitational waves predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity. The expected first detected signals will be from neutron stars coalescing to form a black hole, a cataclysmic astrophysical event. Other possible signals from the coalescence of two black holes into a larger one, and from the merging of a neutron star and a black hole, would lead to great astronomical insights of the existence and features of black holes in the Universe. This group's activities focus on aspects of improvement of the Advanced LIGO detectors and the characterization of data from the Advanced LIGO interferometer. These efforts are fully integrated with those of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), and are especially integrated with the activities of the LIGO Livingston Observatory, since that Observatory is located only 30 miles from the LSU campus. <br/><br/>The LSU group will pursue research activities in two main topics, all coordinated with the LSC and key to the detection of gravitational waves with the Advanced LIGO detectors. One is detector improvement: diagnosing and improving the detector's noise spectral density, data quality and instrument artifacts; calibration of the detector, including error budget and cross validation with different methods; environmental monitoring and effect mitigation; and diagnosing and reduction of transients in suspended test masses. The second is the characterization of the detectors' data: identifying and vetoing instrumental artifacts; developing quantitative statistical methods to use the result of ""follow up investigations"" of gravitational wave candidates to measure confidence in their astrophysical nature, and reduce the possibility that they may be due to rare instrumental artifacts."
0.04,"Recent observations have detected remnants of physical processes that occurred a tiny fraction of second after the origin of the universe. However, the theoretical tools we have at present to interpret these data are far from complete. A key difficulty is how to make Einstein's theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics. The present project seeks to contribute to filling this gap by incorporating new ideas in quantum gravity to cosmology. The goal of this project is twofold: to extend our understanding of the origin and fate of the universe, and to use the last generation of cosmological observations to test recent developments in quantum-gravity. Additionally, this award supports several educational initiatives that enhance the teaching of cosmology at graduate and undergraduate levels through the creation of new courses as well as outreach projects in coordination with the LIGO Science Education Center.<br/><br/>This award supports research aimed at developing theoretical methods to incorporate quantum gravity physics in models of the early universe. Investigations will focus on theoretical as well as phenomenological aspects of quantum cosmology, with special emphasis on techniques coming from loop quantum gravity. From the theoretical point of view, it will be explored how matter fields propagate on regimes where quantum aspects of gravity are important, and the way in which the familiar quantum field theory in curved space-times emerges from the more fundamental theory. From the phenomenological viewpoint, the resulting theoretical framework will be applied to extend cosmological models to include Planck scale physics. Investigations will cover scalar perturbations that are responsible for the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy distribution, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, and gravitational waves generated in the early universe. Attention will also be paid to find mechanisms to account for some anomalies recently observed in cosmic microwave background. The results of this project are expected to reinforce the bridge between quantum gravity and cosmology, producing benefits for both fields."

0.15,"A complete understanding of the history of our universe is not possible without addressing the problems of singularities in classical gravity. Singularities, such as the big bang, are the boundaries of classical space and time where the classical physics stops. These singularities signal that the underlying theory, in this case Einstein's theory of General Relativity, has reached its limit of validity. Answers to fundamental questions such as the birth of the universe thus cannot be obtained using general relativity which is based on the classical notion of space and time. It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity would reveal new physics which provides important clues on the resolution of singularities. In this research, loop quantum gravity is used to explore the fate of singularities in different spacetimes, including cosmological and black hole spacetimes. Lessons from these investigations will be important to understand the quantum nature of spacetime, the physics of the very early universe and the final stages of the gravitational collapse. <br/><br/>Research carried out in this project deals with analytical, phenomenological and numerical investigations of isotropic, anisotropic, black hole and inhomogeneous spacetimes to understand singularity resolution using techniques of loop quantum gravity. By a systematic study of quantization of these spacetimes and its relation with the effective descriptions, precise physics at the Planck scale will be extracted and phenomenological implications will be explored. This research also aims to address fundamental issues pertaining to the quantum probabilities for events, such as the quantum bounce, in a quantum universe. These investigations are expected to give valuable insights on the generic resolution of singularities in quantum gravity."
0.042501,"Overview<br/>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM).<br/><br/>The LHC is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator in the world and is currently operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. It is one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions.<br/><br/>Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) is the first experiment designed specifically to study the decays of hadrons containing beauty or charm quarks at a hadron collider. The goal of LHCb is to identify new physics in nature by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. New physics, or new forces, are manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered. These particles would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries, and thus allow new phenomena to be observed indirectly. In direct searches for new particles, the accelerators' energy must be high enough to allow the particle to be produced. In indirect searches effects of new particles can be seen even if they have a much higher mass than can be seen directly, because the effects are quantum in nature, and appear in calculations where the particles are ""virtual"" so they are emitted and absorbed over short times. LHCb has operated very successfully starting in late 2010. The data are being analyzed and published. The experiment has shown many results, but none so far have clearly demonstrated new physics. LHCb has proposed an upgrade to be completed in the 2018-2019 time-frame when the LHC accelerator will not be running. This upgrade will allow LHCb to collect an order of magnitude more data in decay modes that will either show new physics or severely restrict the allowed mass range. LHCb is comprised of about 10 different sub-detectors or sub-systems. The Syracuse, Maryland, Cincinnati and MIT groups participating in this award have the responsibility of upgrading a part of the charged particle tracking system. The intent is to significantly enhance the capabilities of this system above and beyond the requirement that data can be taken at an order of magnitude higher luminosity.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The intellectual merit of this award is that it is part of an upgrade of LHCb that will allow a much more sensitive search for BSM physics. The main deliverable will be a new inner tracking device, the Upstream Tracker (UT). This device will increase the data throughput over the current tracking device by an order of magnitude, allowing the LHCb experiment to probe BSM physics. The UT, which replaces the current tracker, will consists of four planes of single-sided 250 micron thick silicon strip detectors, read out by a custom-made front-end electronic integrated circuit. With its reduced material budget and optimized segmentation as a function of the distance from the beam line, it plays a crucial role in reducing the rate of fake tracks and in providing fast momentum measurements in the residual field of the dipole magnet. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The broader impacts of this work span several areas. Undergraduate and graduate students will be direct participants in the construction and testing of the detector that will be constructed. For many years a steady stream of undergraduate and graduate students have been working in the PIs' laboratories, where it is a tradition to ensure that graduate students have both hardware experience as well as data analysis capabilities. The upgrade work will be integrated into the Syracuse Quarknet program to involve high school teachers and some of their better students as well. Test results from this detector will be discussed at conferences and published. This detector is an integral part of the LHCb Upgrade and is essential for LHCb to continue to produce cutting edge physics results."
0.04,"In Einstein's theory of general relativity classical spacetime ends at the singularities. Examples include the Big Bang singularity in cosmological models and the central singularity of the black hole spacetimes. At these events the spacetime curvature and tidal forces become infinite. Classical evolution stops. It has been hoped that quantum gravitational effects will provide insights on resolution of this fundamental problem. This Faculty Early CAREER award supports research towards answering various questions related to quantum gravity and resolution of singularities in cosmological and black hole spacetimes. The research carried out in this project will use techniques of loop quantum gravity. A primary objective will be to establish generic properties of quantum spacetime in presence of anisotropies and inhomogenities, and extract reliable phenomenological and observational predictions. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are designed to address a wide audience. The project aims to enhance the scientific enrichment of K-12 students via a public lecture series and science exhibitions and demonstrations. Active engagement techniques will be used to revamp undergraduate and graduate courses. Undergraduate and graduate students will also receive training through research activities.<br/><br/>Detailed implications of the singularity resolution on the physics in different models will be explored. The project aims to significantly broaden and advance our current understanding of the physics of quantum gravity. Research explorations will include (i) systematically investigating the quantization and resulting physics of different spacetimes including anisotropies, inhomogenities in Gowdy models and Schwarzschild black holes, (ii) extracting phenomenological implications by analyzing effects of quantum gravity on cosmological perturbations, and (iii) addressing fundamental issues in quantum cosmology using consistent histories approach. Numerical techniques developed in this project will also lead to fresh insights on results in the classical gravity, such as on the structure of spacetime near classical singularities."
0.381579,"An atom interferometer will be used as an ultra-sensitive tool for measuring perturbations to atomic motion. Laser beams usually attract or repel atoms, but this project will identify wavelengths of light that leave atoms unperturbed. Measuring these so-called ""tune-out wavelengths"" with unprecedented sub-picometer accuracy will serve as a benchmark test for sophisticated atomic structure calculations. This work will establish measurements of tune-out wavelengths as a novel way to test calculations that are needed to support atomic clocks, quantum computation, and atomic parity violation studies.<br/><br/>The broader impacts include training students to pioneer new applications for atom optics.

0.12,"In the twenty year long race to build the first quantum computer a number of physical hardware platforms for such a computer have been investigated including semiconductor circuits, superconducting circuits, charged ionic atoms manipulated in electromagnetic chips, and neutral atoms controlled with lasers. One approach that has lagged behind is the design of a quantum information processor that uses quantum states of light or photons. This is because it is difficult to get photons to interact or 'talk' to each other, a primary requirement in making quantum-computing elements such as transistors. Prior to 2010, photon-based quantum computer circuit designs had a huge overhead in the ancillary quantum and classical circuitry required to build even a simple two-photon transistor. In some of the early designs, tens of thousands of ancillary optical networks and electronic switches were required to construct even a single photon transistor. In 2010 Aaronson Arkhipov at MIT showed that much simpler optical circuit 'a linear optical interferometer' constructed with just a few photons, lenses, mirrors, and other simple optical elements, could be used to solve a particularly hard mathematical problem with an exponential increase in processing power over any classical computer. Since then some five experiments on this new type of optical quantum computer have been carried out worldwide. For this project different circuit designs of this new type of simple optical computer will be investigated and a search for additional mathematical problems that it might be able to solve will be carried out. In addition the possibility of using such a simple optical machine for making imaging devices such as microscopes, or sensors such as magnetic field sensors, that operate with more resolution, precision, and accuracy than is possible classically will be investigated. The great intellectual merit of this project is that it is at the interface of quantum imaging, sensing, and information processing all within the field of quantum metrology. The language of quantum information provides an exciting tool such that problems in one of these fields can be viewed using tools developed in another. Hence any advance in one subfield can almost immediately be applied, with creativity and work, to another subfield. The work is synergistic across all the subfields. All the graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will be trained in the foundations of quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, quantum optics, and AMO theory. The power of multimode, passive, linear optical interferometers for quantum computation, imaging, and sensing will have broad cross-disciplinary commercial, governmental, and scientific impact.<br/><br/>Linear optical interferometers have been thought to be unsuitable for quantum information processing. While nonlinear interferometers provide a route to scalable and universal quantum computation, the strong optical nonlinearities required to implement such schemes have been difficult to attain. Even the so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) scheme proposed by Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) has effective nonlinearities that are generated by the detection and feed-forward processes. The KLM scheme has also proved daunting from a technological standpoint due to the immense number of ancilla resources required per logical gate. It thus came as a surprise to the quantum optics community when Aaronson and Arkhipov (AA) proposed that passive linear optical interferometers with single photon inputs could efficiently solve a type of computational sampling problem, a problem that is likely intractable on a classical or even a universal quantum computer. This result has let to a flurry of recent experiments. Dowling's group was led to a similar conclusion as that of AA in the study of quantum random walks in linear optical interferometers with multiphoton Fock-state inputs. Taken together, these new results indicate that simple linear optical devices contain a hitherto overlooked computational capability that has only yet begun to be explored. LSU has begun an investigation of the computational complexity of such devices from a quantum optics point of view using the standard theoretical tools for describing the propagation of quantum states of lights through linear interferometers. In addition to providing an elementary quantum optical argument for the complexity of the devices with Fock-state inputs, it has been shown that spontaneous parametric down conversion photon sources are a scalable resource for boson sampling and that there is very likely a computational complexity associated with the number sampling of linear optical interferometers with superpositions of coherent 'generalized cat' states. The following tasks will be carried out: (1) investigate the computational complexity of boson sampling in the number basis with non-Gaussian state inputs such as photon added and subtracted Gaussian states; (2) carry out a realistic resource analysis of what is required in practice to develop a large-scale 'post-classical' linear optical quantum information processor; (3) investigate the computational complexity non-Gaussian (number-resolved) sampling with Gaussian inputs; (4) numerically design and test a small-scale programmable post-classical quantum information processor; (5) investigate the performance of linear optical interferometers for the purposes of quantum metrology including optical sensing and imaging."

0.48,"Direct detection of cosmic gravitational waves, an upcoming ""disruptive innovation"" in the field of astrophysics, will revolutionize our understanding of the universe in novel and plausibly unexpected ways. The key instruments for the new discoveries in the United States are the detectors of the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, aLIGO. The research program of the Columbia Experimental Gravity group supports upcoming gravitational wave discoveries by improving the quality of the aLIGO data-streams available for astrophysical science extraction. The group also pioneers data analysis involving multiple cosmic messengers and gravitational waves. Many cosmic objects with strong gravitational fields also possess the strongest magnetic fields, the densest (bulk) nuclear matter, and the highest neutrino fluxes in the universe. Mergers and emissions of these objects can guide us to new physics, and can tell us about elusive cosmic events. Combining information from different windows on the universe, including gravitational waves, will enable us to reconstruct cosmic mysteries of our times. Students from high school through graduate level will have the opportunity to participate in this research. The urban setting and existing outreach infrastructure of Columbia University will enable unique educational and outreach activities based on this research that target schools and the general public not only in the local community but also in the greater New York City metropolitan area.<br/><br/>One of the critical limitations to aLIGO's scientific reach will be the artifacts embedded in the data due to disturbances in the detector's physical environment. The identification of environmental noise sources, the mitigation of their effect in the interferometers as well as the verification of instrument timing is vital (i) for ensuring a discovery that is justifiable to the broader scientific community, and (ii) for the realization of a spectrum of primary science goals for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. These all rely on achieving the design sensitivity for the advanced detectors and on achieving the lowest possible false event rates. In particular, the group will provide expertise in detector noise performance, physical environmental monitoring, and detector diagnostics studies. The anticipated ""dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy"" will enable detailed analysis of the science reach of gravitational-wave searches. Building on past experience the Columbia Experimental Gravity group's scientific focus will be on the foundations, implications and science extraction from joint searches that may involve neutrinos, electromagnetic and other counterparts to gravitational-waves from cosmic explosions, mergers, and other sources."

Fox Accelerator Laboratory of Florida State University (FSU) and the development of a suite of state-of-the-art auxiliary detectors around it. This instrument will allow precision measurements of certain nuclear properties, which determine the energy release and time scale of stellar explosions and studies of the physics of unbound atomic nuclei in general. This instrument reclaims the capability to perform such precision measurements in the USA. <br/><br/>This collaborative MRI award will fund the installation of a large-acceptance, high-resolution Enge split-pole spectrograph (SPS) at the accelerator laboratory at FSU with the purpose of studying the physics of resonant nuclear states that impact nuclear astrophysics and nuclear structure. The SPS became available upon the cessation of operations at the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University. This project will install the 32-tonne instrument at FSU and augment its research capabilities by upgrading its focal plane detectors and developing a new Silicon detector array, in parallel at Louisiana State University (LSU), for efficient spectroscopy of unbound resonances.<br/><br/>The properties of un-bound nuclear states, or resonances, have become a focal point of present day nuclear science as they present the doorway through which stars and stellar explosions build up the elements and release energy. The LSU/FSU collaboration previously developed the Array for Nuclear Astrophysics and Structure with Exotic Beams (ANASEN) for high-efficiency studies of such reactions using beams of radioactive nuclei. A new opportunity for advancing our understanding of nuclear reactions with astrophysical importance stems from the unique combination of high-precision spectroscopy performed with the SPS with the existing program of high-sensitivity studies with radioactive beams currently being performed with ANASEN.<br/><br/>The proposed SPS system also creates an important discovery potential for the physics of exotic nuclear states, studied through a systematic investigation of particle orbitals beyond the binding limit. The interaction of nuclear orbits across shell closures is of importance to the physics of exotic nuclei at the limits of binding. The modification of nuclear properties through the presence of extended wavefunctions will be studied through a detailed spectroscopy of un-bound resonances, studying the presence of the Super-radiance mechanism in the presence of competing particle-decay channels. Again, the research at the SPS is not only complementary, but important to current and future studies with radioactive beams at FSU and the future Facility for Rare isotope Beams (FRIB).<br/><br/>The proposed program around the SPS is a complementary effort and aims to address a lack of experimental opportunities with stable nuclear beams within the U.S. scientific program.

0.219609,"Cancer becomes deadly when tumor cells become motile and begin to spread throughout the patient's body. To become motile, cells must undergo radical changes in their composition and behavior, the so-called epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). These radical changes arise as the network of genes controlling the state of the cell transitions from one type of stable fate to another. This project details a joint theory-experiment physics-biology effort to study how EMT is coordinated in space and time by chemical signals passed among the tumor cells. The specific focus here is on the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway has been studied extensively for its role in developmental biology and has been implicated indirectly in cancer, but has never been studied systematically in this context. The hypothesis to be investigated is that this pathway can allow the formation of small clusters of cells that have undergone EMT together, and which thereafter travel as a collective en route to the establishment of a secondary tumor. If proven to be true, these ideas will shed light on the fundamental origins of metastasis and might in the future offer new strategies for both prognosis and treatment.<br/><br/>Cell-cell interactions, both between tumor cells proper and between tumor and stromal cells, are known to be a key component of many solid tumors. The investigators will focus on how one of these interactions, that mediated by the Notch pathway, can coordinate cell phenotypes and can thereby control tumor progression. To accomplish this will require the use and extension of sophisticated theory techniques from the field of non-equilibrium pattern formation coupled to an experimental plan focused on pancreatic cancer cell lines to be studied in both 2d and 3d in vitro conditions, both without and with supporting cancer-associated fibroblasts. Of particular importance will be measuring spatial correlations of EMT state (and other known correlates) and comparing these to expectations based on different signaling assumptions. Iterating these experiments with increasingly realistic model-building and model-solving will allow for the creation of a quantitatively reliable picture for the collective behavior of the tumor, going well-beyond current individual cell approaches.<br/><br/>This project is cofunded by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division at NSF."

Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimental students learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theory students can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The research is primarily focused on the immediate plasma and atomic physics issues surrounding improving the trapping of antihydrogen, and on the design of a third generation trap optimized for gravitational research. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at Berkeley and at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, Vlasov codes and 3D Particle-In-Cell codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap.

Fundamental physical and chemical processes in these plasmas are poorly understood, primarily due to lack of accurate experimental data which will be obtained in this work. The results obtained during this study will improve our understanding of these processes and are expected to have a major impact on development of low-temperature plasmas for biomedical applications, healthcare, and clean energy.<br/><br/>Fundamental kinetics of pulsed plasmas sustained at a liquid-vapor interface and in liquids will be studied using the following methods: (i) Measurements of electric field in surface ionization wave plasmas at a liquid-vapor interface. These data will provide insight into surface ionization wave structure and dynamics. (ii) Measurements of electron density and electron temperature in the near-surface plasma. These data will quantify input energy partition among different energy modes. (iii) Measurements of solvated electrons in the near-surface liquid layer. These data will show how electrons are transported to the liquid surface and penetrate into the liquid. These measurements may also resolve the fundamental question whether the plasma may be generated directly in the liquid phase. (iv) Measurements of species number densities in the plasma near the liquid-vapor interface. These results will be compared with kinetic modeling predictions to quantify the effect of electric field and electron energy in the surface plasma on vapor phase plasma chemistry. This work will yield quantitative insight into dynamics and kinetics of transient liquid-vapor interface plasmas for which there is little experimental data, and make possible confident prediction of their behavior."

In particular, the track record of the program over the past six years shows that a high percentage of the participants will be underrepresented minority students, and the track record moreover shows that more than half of the participants will be from institutions with limited research opportunities. Finally, to achieve sustained impact, the program is designed to build ties between the Vanderbilt mentors, all of whom are supported with appropriate salary, and faculty at the student's home institution. This builds a larger community, provides for continued support for the student, and enhances the ability for continued mentoring and research participation of the student beyond the REU site experience."
0.43,"This program of research aims to better understand the Universe at the smallest scales by probing nature's basic symmetries and their relation to the origin of mass. The 2012 discovery of a Higgs boson with mass close to 125 GeV represents both the crowning achievement of the standard model of particle physics and a hint beyond it - how can a light Higgs boson possibly survive huge, destabilizing quantum effects without new, undiscovered physics? Further, dark matter is known to exist from astronomical observations; however the particle properties of dark matter remain shrouded in mystery. The combined activities of the UIC group address those basic questions puzzling science - the origin of mass and the particle nature of dark matter - and have the potential for surprising discoveries that may change the way we understand our physical world.<br/><br/>The award also supports technological advances for high energy frontier experiments, in particular building and commissioning sophisticated high-speed electronics and silicon tracking systems for particle physics experiments. The challenges faced in advancing those technologies enhance the disciplinary knowledge in engineering fields. The data analyses and hardware projects supported by this award provide valuable experience and knowledge for students and post doctoral associates at UIC, enabling them to pursue successful careers in the private sector, academia, or research laboratories. The UIC group also fosters close collaboration between high school teachers and the UIC group members, strengthening teaching and learning in Chicago-area high schools. As these high schools serve predominantly minority students, this project aims to increase the number of students from historically underrepresented groups that major in STEM disciplines."
0.4,"This research program involves a study of proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A major goal of the study is to search for and examine possible evidences for new particles and laws of nature beyond those described in the so-called Standard Model, which represents our current understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter and the laws that govern their interactions. The Standard Model is believed to be incomplete, as it fails to account for some important findings and questions, such as the apparent imbalance of matter with respect to antimatter in the universe and strong evidence for dark matter, inferred from astronomical observations. This project will involve performing precise measurements of differences in behavior of matter particles compared with their antimatter counterparts, the results of which may reveal information on the origin of the observed matter-antimatter imbalance in nature, which is crucial to understanding how the universe evolved to its current state. In addition to these fundamental research goals, the funding for this research program enables the training of the next generations of scientists and engineers at all levels, including undergraduates, PhD. graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and engineers working at the frontier of particle physics research with the state of the art data analysis and computing techniques, electronics instrumentations and particle and radiation detection techniques.<br/><br/>This research is carried out with the LHCb particle detector at the LHC collider at the CERN laboratory. The specific focus of the research is on studies of reactions involving particles that contain the bottom quark or the charm quark. These studies allow for precise tests of the Standard Model, which may reveal possible deviations from its predictions. The findings, together with expected results from experiments at the energy frontier, could help uncover new laws of nature and point the way to the structure of new physics beyond the Standard Model. The research program also involves the upgrade of the LHCb detector, which is required for operations at higher luminosity of the LHC collider. The detector upgrade effort is focused on the design of electronics instrumentation for extracting and recording electrical signals from a silicon strip tracking system located just upstream of the LHCb magnet."
1.821,"At the high energy frontier in particle physics there are several key, unanswered questions. As yet undiscovered, more massive particles could explain a number of these mysteries. For example, in the universe today, there is much more ordinary matter than antimatter. However, no mechanism of known particle interactions can explain how the universe evolved from the matter-antimatter balance at the time of the Big Bang to the present, highly unbalanced, situation. By making precision measurements, it is possible to detect the echoes of such massive particles, common at the time of the Big Bang, in quantities like the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which just reflects the separation of the neutron's composite positive and negative charges. In addition to advancing our knowledge in particle physics and cosmology, and generating technological progress, this experiment will involve post-doctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students as an essential part, affording the young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their education and training in a forefront area of nuclear physics.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) is an explicitly time-reversal-violating observable that has played an important role in descriptions of elementary particle physics; measured upper limits continue to limit extensions of prevailing models. For example, at present, supersymmetry (SUSY) predicts a value of roughly 10^-25 e-cm for a SUSY mass scale of 1 Teraelectronvolt and maximal mixing. It is clear that measurements at the scale of 10^-28 e-cm as proposed here will provide important input at combinations of very high mass scales and small mixing angles. The neutron EDM is also important for understanding the general pattern of T-(CP-) violation and the cause of the observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the universe.<br/><br/>This experiment, to be performed at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline of the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL, is based on a technique that is qualitatively different from the strategies adopted in previous measurements. The basic technique in the present experiment involves formation of a three-component fluid of polarized neutrons and Helium-3 atoms dissolved in a bath of superfluid Helium-4 at a temperature T ~ 0.5 K. The ultracold neutrons in this volume, trapped in a plastic measurement cell, are produced by the collision of 8.9 Ångstrom neutrons with the phonons of the superfluid. The neutron and Helium-3 magnetic dipoles precess in the plane perpendicular to an applied external magnetic field, B0 in a traditional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance arrangement. The nEDM, dn, is determined by measuring the neutron precession frequency in the presence of a strong electric field, E0. Application of the electric field parallel (antiparallel) to B0 changes the Larmor precession frequency, nu, in proportion to dn. With B0 = 30 milliGauss and E0 = 50 kiloVolt/cm, nu = 88 Hertz and the frequency shift is 4.8 nanoHertz for an EDM of 10^-28 e-cm. Operationally, the neutron precession frequency is measured relative to that of the Helium-3 by taking advantage of the strongly spin dependent nuclear capture reaction and detecting the recoiling proton and triton via scintillation produced in the liquid Helium-4. The polarized Helium-3 atoms (in the same volume as the neutrons) also comprise a co-magnetometer (since any EDM of the Helium-3 atoms is suppressed by its atomic electrons); their precession is observed directly using SQUIDS.<br/><br/>This project provides important training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs as they participate in forefront physics research that stretches across areas including low temperature, atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The results of the experiment potentially impact particle physics as well as astrophysics and cosmology. Some technological developments are expected as several SBIR and STTR grants related to the experimental apparatus have been awarded to date."

The project is part of an ongoing collaboration with colleagues at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and Florida State University (FSU). The proposed work will contribute to the understanding of the evolution of shell structure and core polarization in neutron-rich calcium isotopes beyond 48Ca and the collapse of the N = 28 shell in 42Si via inverse-kinematics proton scattering measurements at the NSCL.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the project includes maintaining an active research program in nuclear structure on the Ursinus College campus. Ursinus College is a national liberal arts college of about 1700 students with a long history of strength in the sciences. This project will provide students opportunities to apply their knowledge of physics outside the classroom, gain practical skills in data acquisition and analysis, observe and participate in the operation of a nuclear accelerator facility, and present their work to colleagues. The project will span three years and support two students for 8-10 weeks per summer. Participants will travel to the NSCL to perform experiments and analyze the data at Ursinus.

0.157005,"This award funds the research activities of Professor James Bullock at the University of California, Irvine.<br/><br/>Professor Bullock's research aims to explore the nature of dark matter using supercomputer simulations. Dark matter stands among the deepest mysteries in science. It makes up some 85% of the clustering matter in the universe, yet its fundamental nature remains unknown. The existence of dark matter provides one of the strongest pieces of evidence that our understanding of nature remains incomplete. The most popular idea at this time is that the dark matter is made of a single particle that interacts only weakly with itself (and with normal matter), but this model faces some difficulties reproducing observations on the scales of galaxies. An intriguing solution is that the dark matter is more complex, with its own set of strong self-interactions, analogous, perhaps, to the particles that make up the visible world. This award will support supercomputer simulations of galaxy formation including both standard dark matter and more complex dark matter to determine whether or not galaxy observations provide evidence that dark matter is self-interacting. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of the universe. Moreover, the simulation codes and analysis software will be made public and Professor Bullock will mentor graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school students as part of this project, providing these young people with mathematical, computational, and data-mining training that will be a valuable asset for them and their communities well past the funding period. Professor Bullock will also give public lectures on this research.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Bullock will use a suite of simulations to provide the most accurate and robust constraints yet derived on the dark matter self-interaction cross-section and to determine whether or not self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models provide a better match to data than standard cold dark matter once realistic treatments of baryons are included. The work will include 1) focused, idealized simulations of individual galaxies and merging galaxy clusters; 2) cosmological simulations; and 3) full hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation set within the SIDM framework. This work builds upon an existing and well-tested code, and will involve running models with velocity-independent, isotropic, energy-exchange cross-sections as well as models with more complex behavior in velocity-dependence and non-isotropic scattering."

The students will also engage in a program of field trips and professional development activities that educate them about the conduct of research and arm them with the information and tools they need to define and achieve their educational and professional goals. The award will promote the progress of science in the multiple areas from which research projects are drawn, and will support the education and training of 27 students-- many from underrepresented backgrounds and/or institutions with limited research opportunities-- thereby broadening participation in the physics and astronomy communities and the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>To achieve its goals, the REU site will provide a mixture of formal and informal settings in which participating students will interact with each other, with their faculty mentors and assigned graduate student ""near-peer"" mentors, with Rutgers undergraduate physics and astronomy majors, and with a diverse co-residential peer group from outside Rutgers working in completely different STEM fields. Faculty mentors include multiple APS Fellows and NSF CAREER award winners and are a vibrant, collegial, intellectually diverse, and well-funded set of scientist-educators with exciting research programs and excellent records of working with undergraduates. Students will live and socialize with peers in the Rutgers Research in Science and Engineering (RiSE) program, a key organizational partner.

Data from the LHC and other particle physics experiments are deepening our understanding of the fundamental interactions and probing the weak scale with unprecedented detail. At the same time, outstanding questions in astrophysics and cosmology also guide theoretical work on physics beyond the so-called ""Standard Model"", and the interaction of cosmology and particle physics in recent years has been fruitful.

0.9,"This research will consist of experiments, theory, and simulation on a broad range of fundamental processes in plasmas, and will emphasize problems for which precise experimental tests of theory can be obtained. The experiments will be performed on two well-instrumented non-neutral plasma apparatuses: a laser-diagnosed ion apparatus which can ""tag"" ions and follow their subsequent motion; and a camera-diagnosed electron apparatus. Theory work will focus on long-range collisions between particles, where a newly-discovered ""collisional caging"" effect gives enhanced particle slowing-down rates and enhanced cross-field transport. Characterization of collisions in correlated plasmas will also continue, especially in regard to the ""dynamical screening"" controversy in stellar fusion.<br/><br/>This research program makes strong interdisciplinary connections across fields of physics, contributing to and drawing from atomic physics, statistical physics, fluid physics and plasma physics. For example, the electron experiments and theory have provided insight into vortices in large-scale atmospheric flows, and recent results on ""chaotic"" particle transport relate directly to fusion plasmas in toroidal geometry. The ""rotating wall"" technique for infinite-time containment was developed at UCSD, and is now used widely, especially for expensive particles such as anti-matter. Moreover, the strong, iterative interaction between theory and experiment provides an exceptionally rich environment for training undergraduate and graduate students."
0.150866,"Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary ""dark matter"" particles that do not emit or absorb light. Remarkably, particle physics theories proposed for other reasons predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with just the right properties to be this dark matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-based detectors. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The Large Underground Xenon experiment (LUX) is a two-phase (liquid/gas) xenon (LXe) experiment designed for the search for dark matter interactions with ordinary matter.<br/><br/>Development of technology related to LXe will find use in the increasing number of experiments worldwide using noble liquids as detection materials. These projects will also result in technical training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate and undergraduate students. LXe has practical applications to gamma ray imaging for astrophysics, Homeland Security, and medical imaging.

From its operations to date, LUX has the most sensitive limit in the world for spin-independent dark matter interactions for WIMP masses above 6 GeV. This award provides support for continued LUX operations, followed by decommissioning, over the period of March 2015 through December 2016. Continued LUX operation through mid-2016 is expected to result in considerably improved sensitivity, reaching a factor of five in improvement over existing limits at high WIMP masses."

The benefits of this broadly applicable approach will be demonstrated by advancing the research areas of black hole astrophysics, and also the search for new pulsars in astronomical data. In addition, because graduate students will be trained on cutting-edge computer technology and scientific algorithms, this project will generate highly employable engineers and scientists, including those associated with great national need. <br/><br/>The project advances the computational research areas of black hole astrophysics and the search for pulsars in astronomical data using a novel approach toward supercomputing utilizing consumer gaming hardware.

0.153857,"This project is a collaborative effort between Bryn Mawr College and Ursinus College in which we are exploring the coherent control of interactions among ultracold Rydberg atoms with a combination of experimental and computational efforts. When atoms in an ultracold gas are excited to weakly bound Rydberg states, they can exchange energy through a dipole-dipole interaction. In many cases this energy exchange proceeds quickly enough that the atoms are essentially stationary, resembling an amorphous solid. This leads to complicated many-body processes during the energy exchange that can be manipulated with a variety of techniques. We are focusing our efforts on coherently controlling the dipole-dipole energy exchange among atoms by exciting coherent superpositions of initial states, arranging the Rydberg atoms in particular spatial patterns, and manipulating the geometry and timing of the electric field used to tune this energy exchange into resonance. These experiments are helping to expand the toolkit for controlling atomic interactions. We are modeling the experiments using parallel computing resources in order to contribute to the understanding of the complex many-body interactions.<br/><br/>Cold Rydberg atoms provide a rich system in which to explore a range of fundamental physics that is of interest to a broad segment of the community. The precision with which both the internal structure of each atom and the spatial arrangement of these atoms can be controlled will allow us to study many-body and correlation effects for a range of configurations. The interest in ultracold gases coupled by long range dipole-dipole interactions has grown rapidly in recent years and is being explored using atoms with large magnetic spins and heteronuclear molecules as well as Rydberg atoms.<br/><br/>This project will engage undergraduates, with particular attention to attracting female students, at both Bryn Mawr and Ursinus in computational and experimental research on ultracold Rydberg atoms. Bryn Mawr and Ursinus are small, national liberal arts colleges located in close proximity in southeastern Pennsylvania.

0.14,"At its most fundamental the physical description of the world around us seems to require two ingredients: elementary particles and interactions between pairs of such particles. For example, photons, the elementary particle of light, can scatter from a single electron and charged electrons will repel each other via the Coulomb force. Even objects that contain many elementary particles seem to interact in pairs. The scattering between atoms, with their many protons, neutrons, and electrons, for example, is often described in terms of interactions between pairs of them. At a bigger scale the motion of the moon, earth, and sun is describable in terms of the gravitational attraction between pairs of them. The composition of the moon, earth, or sun does not matter. This work, however, will focus on the study of three-body interactions, those that are not simply the sum of the pair-wise interactions, but those whose effect is zero when one of the three bodies is removed, and examine their influence on the physical description of the world. This project will train a University of Maryland graduate student. The student will be exposed to quantum physics at a fundamental yet practical level. The proximity to local atomic-physics laboratories, including the Joint Quantum Institute and NIST, will also greatly benefit the student.<br/><br/>In atomic, molecular, and optical physics, there are several cases where three-body interactions are known to matter. For example, in the description of interacting, reacting, and colliding molecules, such forces arise in the so-called Born-Oppenheimer approximation when integrating out the fast electron motion. Conceived in nuclear physics, tri-atomic Efimov states are now studied with ultra-cold atoms at temperatures on the order of a nanoKelvin. Binding of these weakly-bound states crucially depends on a so-called three-body parameter. In all cases three-body interactions emerge when high-energy modes or fast constituents are ""eliminated"" from the description. <br/><br/>This group will design or engineer many-body systems of ultra-cold atoms or molecules held in laser-generated periodic potentials that solely interact through three-body forces. More precisely, starting from a Hamiltonian, where atoms do interact through pair-wise interactions, the investigators will derive effective Hamiltonians that only contain three-body interactions. The ability to freely adjust the periodic trapping potential as well as the strength of the two-particle interactions will be crucial. Research into such effective many-body Hamiltonians has intellectual merit for two separate reasons. Firstly, the research addresses fundamental questions about the origin or emergence of three-body forces. Moreover, for the first time it may be possible to create a realistic system with controllable two-body forces and thereby highlight the role of three-body forces. A second intellectual merit of a design of such a Hamiltonian is that they might have quantum ground states or phases with unique order. For example, it can lead to superfluids with pairs of atoms. This approach relies on controllable cancellations between contributions to the two-body interaction, leaving only three-body interactions. In addition, it relies on time-dependent changes in and driving of the single-particle optical-lattice potential to populate a subset of levels, whose energies simulate three-body interactions. There will be impact in other fields of physics where effective field theories and collective phenomena are important, such as condensed matter and high-energy physics. In particular, with atomic system one can study processes that are fundamental but far-less accessible in systems investigated by those fields."
0.2,"Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the microscopic theory of the strong interactions and allows us to understand how hadrons, such as the proton, neutron and pion, are formed through partons, the building blocks of QCD. High-energy scattering processes can be used to explore how partons (quarks and gluons) that come out of a high-energy scattering make a transition into hadrons. While various aspects of these processes are well understood, many striking puzzles remain. Transverse single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) represent one such puzzle. Early QCD calculations predicted basically vanishing effects, but experiments revealed huge SSAs up to 40%. Despite decades of research, the detailed understanding of single-spin asymmetries in QCD is still missing. In this context, this project will explore the role played by the fragmentation of partons for different single-spin asymmetries. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be involved in this very active field at the frontier of current hadronic physics.<br/><br/>This project will make possible extensive numerical studies of transverse SSAs for single-hadron production in proton-proton collisions, where one of the incoming protons is polarized perpendicular to the reaction plane. These studies will make use of existing analytical results that were developed previously by the investigator and one of his graduate students. Not only is this investigation expected to clarify if parton fragmentation can indeed explain the huge SSAs observed experimentally, but also whether a simultaneous description of SSAs in hadronic collisions and in lepton-induced processes can be obtained. This project is closely related to experiments conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and other accelerator facilities worldwide."
0.21,"Symmetries provide both means for unification of otherwise disparate branches of science and a language for communication between scientists and non-scientists. Two symmetries are prominent in this project: multidimensional kaleidoscopes and the quantum-mechanical supersymmetry that relates the motion with obstacles to the motion in free space. Through these symmetries some real physical effects---prohibition of chemical processes and slowdown of relaxation in waveguide-confined gases, transparency of solitary waves for other waves, etc---are tightly intertwined with tiling with polygons, Platonic solids, and cat-eye reflectors. The PI's presentation at the ""Meet the Scientists!"" at the Science Discovery Museum, entitled ""Kaleidoscopes, tilings, Newton's cradles, and atoms at a billionth degree above absolute zero"", scheduled for the beginning of May 2014, has effectively the same content as one of the three parts of this project. <br/><br/>This project constitutes an indispensable pedagogical tool for training undergraduate and masters-level students. Each of the three sub-projects, while touching upon a range of advanced methods of modern theoretical physics, from Lie groups to quantum mechanical supersymmetry, does so gently, dealing with objects as graspable as ordinary differential equations. The sub-projects are also modular, divisible into several year-long smaller projects, and so ideal for an honors or MS thesis. Many qualitative ideas developed in the course of preparation for the project greatly contributed to the development of an undergraduate-oriented book.<br/><br/>Nonlinear physics is famous for its archipelagoes of small under- or unexplored islands. The ultracold atomic gases are the ideal vehicle for visiting such islands. The nonlinear phenomena considered in this project are as follows: a protocol for an experimental generation of a Gross-Pitaevskii breather, in a waveguide for cold attractive bosons. (A further study will address the integrability-induced robustness of the chemical composition of one-dimensional Bose gases.); an analysis of the transparency of the Andreev-Bogoliubov-de Gennes BCS soliton to quasi-particles, using information previously acquired in a study of transparency of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for known integrable partial differential equations. At the moment, it is not clear what physical phenomenon the BCS soliton transparency is supposed to enable, with the primary candidate being the Andreev reflection. A systematic study of quantum and classical cases of the three body scattering without diffraction associated with non-crystallographic and exceptional crystallographic root systems (kaleidoscopic mirror arangements) will also be performed. A particular sequence of mass triplets-with ( sqrt(5) + 2) : 1 : (sqrt(5) + 2) being the first nontrivial member that behave similarly to the Newton cradle will be identified. Here, the momentum distribution remains invariant under three-body collisions. The plan includes a systematic molecular-dynamics study of many-body mass mixtures, with masses controlled by optical lattices, with an expectation that the relaxation time will show peaks at the ""extended Newton cradle"" mass ratios."
0.3,"The quest for fully functional, universal quantum computing is an important scientific and societal goal. A working quantum computer would bring about revolutionary advances by enabling quantum calculations at currently unfathomable scales, as first proposed by Richard Feynman. An example would be that of large biological molecules, which could empower drug discovery in an unprecedented manner. Another important application for the quantum computer is provided by Shor's algorithm for factoring integers exponentially faster than a classical computer, which would provide a way to defeat the current standard encryption methods (such as RSA) and is hence of relevance to national security. The realization of quantum computing is an inordinately difficult task for which the ideal experimental platform is not yet known. The two daunting challenges that stand in the way of the realization of a practical quantum computer of nontrivial size are overcoming decoherence, i.e., making reliable quantum bits 'qubits' and achieving scalability, i.e., producing large numbers of individually addressable qubits. Competing approaches on a worldwide scale involve ions in electromagnetic traps, atoms in optical traps, superconducting circuits, artificial atoms such as quantum dots or engineered dopant-vacancy defects in diamond, and pure light. The last approach has been successfully developed, with NSF support, by the Quantum Fields and Quantum Information (QFQI) group at the University of Virginia. It builds on exploiting the density of spectral encoding available to braodband emitting lasers and, more precisely, optical parametric oscillators (OPO). <br/><br/>This project addresses a unique, scalable implementation of quantum information and quantum computing in an ultracompact physical system: the quantum optical frequency comb defined by the resonant modes (qumodes) of a single OPO. With NSF support, the QFQI group initiated the idea and pioneered its implementation in the laboratory, demonstrating record-levels of multipartite entanglement (60 qumodes, the optical field analogs of qubits) and obtaining several theoretical results in collaboration with Nick Menicucci at the U. of Sydney. The project will expand this widely successful frequency-domain entanglement approach to the time domain, and use hybrid frequency-time entanglement in order to implement a universal quantum computer in a single OPO. This will require the first ever realization of a fully scalable two-dimensional square-grid-lattice cluster state, which will still take place in a single OPO, by combining frequency-domain and time-domain entanglement --- as frequency and time will effectively constitute each dimension of the square-grid lattice. Such a realization includes the possibility of quantum error encoding using the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill scheme, for which Menicucci recently proved the existence of a fault tolerance threshold."
0.17,"In the realm of physics and many other fields of natural science, reductionism --- a complicated system can be reduced to simpler constituents and the properties of the whole can be inferred from the study of each constituent parts --- has played an important role. However, there also exist many examples where a reductionistic method does not provide a complete picture. As more and more parts are added, new phenomena may emerge at different stages and these new phenomena cannot be fully understood from the properties of the simpler system that precedes it. Such emergent behavior is well known in science. <br/><br/>The system of cold atoms represents an ideal platform to investigate the emergent phenomena. Experimentally, several labs have developed techniques to accurately control the number of atoms in their atom traps, from one, to a few, to many. This is made possible by the exquisite controllability of cold atoms. The proposed research aims to provide a theoretical understanding of various cold atomic systems. The central theme is to study how the properties of single atoms affect the physics of a few-atom or a many-atom system. <br/><br/>This research is of fundamental nature --- the basic science of cold atoms. Fundamental issues that will be addressed include: How does an atom or an ensemble of atoms interact with a quantum field of light? Will an ensemble of atoms that are interacting with each other and prepared out of equilibrium reach equilibrium? If so, how? When the inter-atomic interaction becomes very strong, what exotic properties will emerge? Many of these issues are at the forefront of the field of cold atoms and quantum many-body systems. This work will therefore significantly advance the relevant fields. <br/><br/>In this project, the connection among single-body, few-body and many-body physics using the platform of cold atoms is investigated. There are four main topic areas: cold atoms inside an optical cavity, coupling both the internal and the external degrees of freedom of the atoms; cold atoms subject to synthetic spin-orbit coupling; quantum magnetism with 1D quantum gases; and far-off-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Each of these topics represents a relatively independent research direction, though there also are strong connections among different topics. A number of different theoretical techniques will be used to tackle these problems, including the mean-field method, the variational method, perturbation calculations, exact diagonalization, time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) for example."
0.36,"Quantum entanglement, a quantum mechanical phenomenon that quantifies the interdependence of spatially separated parts of a system, has become a fundamental concept in physics with broad applications, ranging from quantum information, to quantum metrology, to the classification and understanding of condensed matter systems. A vital part of this project, which is to develop new methods to investigate the dynamics of entanglement, is to establish a close connection between the theoretical effort and experimental realizations of long-range interacting systems with a particular emphasis on arrays of trapped ions in self-assembled crystals. In these systems it is possible to engineer long-range interactions that depend on the internal states of the ions (spin) by adjusting the frequency of laser beams that illuminate the ions and impart a spin dependent force. The scope of the research effort can be placed in the context of ""quantum simulation"": experiments will be conducted to simulate models whose dynamics is difficult to access by existing numerical methods, and approximate methods capable of reproducing the observed dynamics will then be developed. This work will lead to a more fundamental understanding of spin dynamics and entanglement in complex quantum systems, and will contribute towards the realization of new classes of quantum materials and technologies. Moreover, it will train and provide research experience to a graduate student and a postdoc. They will have the opportunity to work with the NIST/Boulder experimental ion trap group, in addition to the theory groups at JILA and the University of Colorado at Boulder and thus will be exposed to a highly collaborative atmosphere. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to develop new methods capable to describe the dynamics of entanglement in systems made of many particles with two internal degrees of freedom (spin), that interact and crosstalk at long distances. The investigators will allow the possibility that the spin system also exchanges energy and information with an external reservoir (open system). The intellectual focus of the research will be divided in three main thrusts: (i) Hamiltonian dynamics, (ii) Dissipative dynamics with single particle decoherence and (iii) Driven-dissipative dynamics with more complex many-body decoherence. Thrust (i) plans to investigate the development of entanglement and correlations in spin 1/2 XXZ models with arbitrary coupling constants after a quench, starting with easily preparable and high fidelity product states. Thrust (ii) will delve on the interplay between local Markovian decoherence and many-body interactions in these systems. Thrust (iii) will study the interplay between elastic interactions and collective dissipative couplings, in the presence of external driving sources. These are challenging goals but the synergy of interests and abilities of the investigators -- with expertise that spans the different but complementary areas of quantum optics, condensed matter, and theoretical and experimental atomic physics-- will allow the group to delve into a broad range of problems, which would be difficult or unfeasible for a single investigator program."
0.105,"The study of atomic collisions provides important information about one of the fundamental forces of nature. The results of atomic collisions research are widely used in fields such as plasma physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and many other areas. In addition to providing a better overall understanding of heavy-ion collisions, which is the principal focus of the effort, this work will bring a well-known technique from other areas of physics into atomic and molecular collisions research, and possibly lead to additional overlap and collaborations between the atomic collisions community and other related fields. Another important aspect of this project is the inclusion of undergraduate students in cutting-edge research. By participating in this project, students will gain valuable hands-on research experience through code development and data analysis. They will also present their results at regional and national conferences, which will hopefully give them a more global view of scientific research.<br/><br/>The few-body problem is one of the most fundamental, unsolved problems in physics. When more than two particles interact through the Coulomb force, the dynamics of the system cannot be described exactly. As a result, theory must resort to approximations, and any discrepancies that result between theory and experiment must be a result of the approximations. A comparison of current theoretical models with recent experimental results reveals some striking limitations of the current models. In particular, the dynamics of collisions in which some of the collision fragments are found in a full 3-dimensional geometry is not understood. The underlying mechanism behind these 3-dimensional collisions is known to be a result of quantum mechanical effects, but current theories cannot accurately describe the collision dynamics. The objective of this project is to develop a novel quantum mechanical theoretical model for the study of ion-impact atomic collisions through the use of the path integral technique. The path integral method is a well-known technique used in other areas of physics, but has not been applied to the study of heavy-ion collisions. This particular technique will allow for the inclusion of important quantum mechanical interactions, as well as provide an intuitive understanding of particle trajectories during the collision. <br/><br/>The technical details of the project include the development of a computational model using the path integral method for ionization and capture processes with heavy-ion projectiles. The method will utilize an expansion of the Lagrangian around the classical path, where the deviation from the classical path represents the quantum fluctuations of the particle. For electron capture collisions, the role of the projectile-nuclear interaction and target electron correlation will be studied. Electron capture collisions with high projectile energy and large scattering angle will also be studied with the objective of better understanding the Thomas mechanism, and determining if possible diffraction effects exist in these collisions. For ionization processes, collisions in which the ejected electron is found outside of the scattering plane will be studied, with a focus on projectile-nuclear interactions and the role of close collisions between the projectile and the target nucleus."
0.27,"This project concerns the theoretical exploration of the properties of strongly interacting matter at ultra-high densities (10 to 20 times denser than atomic nuclei) and temperatures (several hundred billion degrees). It is generally accepted by the scientific community that the universe was filled with super-dense matter shortly after the Big Bang. Super-dense matter continues to be created in the final stages of catastrophic stellar events, such as core-collapse supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, and it may be present deep inside the cores of collapsed stars, known as neutron stars. Neutron stars are typically about 20 kilometers across and spin rapidly, often making many hundred of rotations per second. A thimble full of neutron star matter would have a mass of one billion tons! At such extraordinary conditions atoms themselves collapse, and atomic nuclei are squeezed so tightly together that new fundamental particles are generated and novel states of matter are created. This makes neutron stars, and the catastrophic stellar events creating them, into excellent astrophysical laboratories for a wide range of physical studies, which are addressed in this project. Theoretical predictions concerning the equation of state of matter under these extreme conditions can be used to compare the results of simulations with observational data accumulating rapidly from both orbiting and ground based observatories spanning the radiation spectrum from X-rays to radio wavelengths.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the role of quark deconfinement for (proto) neutron stars and core-collapse supernova events, using a state-of-the-art (non-local 3-flavor Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio, n3PNJL) model for the description of quark matter. The n3PNJL model accounts for the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and mimics quark confinement via the Polyakov loop potential. In recent years, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model has become the workhorse for various studies in theoretical nuclear physics, as it provides a very versatile and numerically treatable approach to the theory of the strong interaction (quantum chromodynamics, QCD). This research will consists of five intertwined activities concerning (1) the equation of state of cold quark-hybrid matter; (2) color superconductivity treated in the framework of the n3PNJL model; (3) quark deconfinement in (proto) neutron stars; (4) the properties of a quark-hadron Coulomb lattice that may exist in the cores of neutron stars; and (5) the role of quark deconfinement for core-collapse supernovae. The best available data from heavy ion collisions and neutron star observations will be used to impose the strongest possible constraints on the equation of state that will be developed in the framework of this research project. The equations of state will be made available to the wider nuclear and astrophysics community to explore the birth, structure and evolution of (proto) neutron stars and the events which create them."
0.049595,"Imaging plays a critical role in the diagnosis, staging, and in the assessment of therapeutic response in cancer. Imaging is of course a broad discipline encompassing a variety of rather different modalities (X-ray, MRI, PET) and analysis techniques. Principles from the fields of physics and mathematics can be applied to the analysis and interpretation of current imaging techniques as well to development of novel imaging techniques. A key issue for the field is the extent to which different methods can be used synergistically to gain additional information. Another key issue is improving the usefulness of specialized contrast agents to get around existing limitations in signal to noise and/or spatial resolution. To address the aforementioned challenges, the organizers will convene a two-day focused workshop to be held in the Boston area. The two-day highly focused meeting will have a full agenda of topics at the intersection of physics and mathematics and cancer imaging. The meeting will be oriented around a high level of interactions between participants, focusing on problems where fundamental physical and mathematical principles and advanced imaging can be leveraged to make progress towards cancer diagnosis and treatment. Most of each session will be devoted to active discussion within a small group of invitees, who span both the physics and engineering of advanced imaging and biologists and clinicians at the forefront of cancer biology and treatment. This will be the first informal workshop that tries to create an integrated picture of what can be accomplished via noninvasive methods in human patients. It is expected that the white paper generated as part of the meeting follow-up will have a very large impact on the direction of scientific research in this essential area. Bringing together experts from different parts of this field can be expected to lead to new directions and ultimately better imaging ""products"" for the practicing oncologist. At a more basic science level, it is expected that the ideas generated may be useful for other applications of imaging in biology and biomedicine. To facilitate the spread of ideas generated by this meeting to the rest of the community, synopses of various talks as well as an overall summary will be posted at http://www.martinos.org/martinos/poahi/ and linked to the community Physics of Cancer website: http://physicsandcancer.org/"
0.36,"Classical imaging is limited in sensitivity and resolution by the statistical noise properties of the light used to create the images. In everyday life a classical description of light usually suffices; however this leads to limitations on both the sensitivity of detecting objects as well as the resolution with which one can detect them that are not fundamental. Using a quantum mechanical description of the light, ""non-classical"" light fields can be envisioned that will lead to better detection sensitivity and imaging resolution than with classical light. Using non-linear optical properties of certain materials, non-classical light fields can be created and these fields can be investigated to see how much better they are than the classical limits. Such ""quantum illumination"" has been shown to be capable of improved detection sensitivity, but has not been demonstrated in an imaging situation before, where very different detector and light-source technologies are required. These techniques are especially useful at very low light levels, and thus are interesting in the field of imaging of live biological tissues where one would like to avoid damage to the tissue.<br/><br/>It has been demonstrated that four-wave mixing in atomic vapors can generate light with interesting quantum properties, and do so under conditions where non-trivial imaging is possible. This project takes advantage of the development of this light source to investigate three distinct ideas: the ""SU(1,1)"" interferometer which potentially exceeds the sensitivity of conventional interferometers, the copier-phase sensitive amplifier (a low-noise optical amplifier for images), and quantum illumination for remote sensing. The extent to which the advantages of quantum illumination and coherent detection can be achieved in practice will be investigated. The work involves the investigation of newly introduced quantum techniques in the context of interferometric sensing and imaging, and it allows the further development of quantum-noise-limited imaging and detection. Quantum entanglement of the light beams could allow improvements in imaging, and have an impact on the study of quantum information processing techniques. These techniques are especially useful at very low light levels, and thus are interesting in the field of imaging of live biological tissues in order to avoid damage to the tissue."
0.18,"Positronium is the bound state of the electron and its antiparticle, the positron. As such, it forms an ""exotic atom"", similar in many ways to the traditional simple atoms such as hydrogen and helium, but different because of its unique composition and because of its tendency to annihilate, transforming into pure electromagnetic energy in the form of high-energy photons. Many properties of positronium, such as energy level differences and lifetimes, are accessible to high-precision experiments. Positronium properties can also be calculated theoretically to high precision. Consequently, positronium is an ideal system for testing the limits of electromagnetic bound state physics. The positronium hyperfine splitting--the interval between the spin-1 and spin-0 variants of the lowest energy state--is of prime interest because there is a long-standing difference (of about four times the experimental uncertainty) between theory and experiment for this splitting. The current proposal is to calculate the positronium hyperfine interval to a higher level. When complete, the result of this work will help to resolve or sharpen the positronium hyperfine discrepancy. This theoretical work is timely because two experimental groups, based at the University of California, Riverside and at the University of Tokyo, are developing improved experimental measurements of the hyperfine interval. The combination of improved experimental results and higher precision theory will work together to give bound-state Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) one of its most stringent tests to date. An important aspect of this project will be the training of undergraduate student collaborators in the techniques and processes of scientific investigation in this field. The overall project involves a number of distinct parts that will make ideal projects for small teams of students. The students will cooperate in all aspects of the work including the development of calculational techniques and tools, the calculations themselves, presentation at scientific meetings, and publication. <br/><br/>Positronium properties will be calculated theoretically to high precision using the methods of bound-state Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) because strong and weak interaction effects are negligible. The positronium hyperfine interval will be calculated to a higher level of precision than heretofore by completing all three-loop corrections to the hyperfine interval. This will require an application of effective field theory methods, specifically Non-Relativistic QED (NRQED), at the three-loop order. When complete, the result of this work will help to resolve or sharpen the positronium hyperfine discrepancy."
0.596335,"This award will allow for the establishment of a strong research and educational development program in the field of ultrafast atomic, molecular, and optical sciences in the Department of Physics at the University of Arizona. The program will study atomic and molecular response to strong transient electric fields with simultaneous use of IR and XUV pulses in attosecond precision experiments. This will involve measurement and control of electronic and nuclear dynamics in highly-excited molecules using attosecond/femtosecond resolved pump-probe experiments. Ultrashort XUV excitation provides direct access to an interesting and challenging regime, where atoms and molecules are energetically far from their ground-state configuration. Using attosecond time-resolved XUV+IR experiments, we can measure the effect of strong electric fields on excited bound-state wavepackets in atomic systems. These measurements will offer new opportunities for the control of electron dynamics on attosecond time-scales. In molecules, the XUV excitation is associated with fast inner-valence electron phenomenon, correlated two-electron processes, and strongly interdependent electronic and nuclear dynamics. The understanding of time-resolved dynamics in this regime has been very limited due to the spectroscopic difficulties in probing inherently low cross-section photo-fragmentation channels; the complexity of the potential energy surface manifold in highly-excited systems; and the paucity of efficient, tunable, femtosecond/attosecond XUV photon sources. This project aims at investigating this regime by utilizing cutting-edge research tools, such as, tailored XUV pulses, and efficient photo-fragment imaging schemes.<br/><br/>The broader aspects include the CAREER educational objectives that will increase the representation of Hispanic students in physics research; directly involve undergraduate students in ultrafast science research; and lead to the development and web-based dissemination of interactive learning programs. This training and outreach, along with the forefront research will help make our nation more competitive in the field of attosecond and femtosecond science. The educational plan targets students from an under-represented group. In collaboration with a primarily Hispanic institution (UTEP), Hispanic students will obtain hands-on experience and vital exposure in a cutting edge field of research. With the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, the educational program leads to the development of interactive learning programs in optics/AMO, along with a method for web-based publication and dissemination, in a manner that will be useful to wider community. The research spin-offs of this program will be in the form of new insights and discoveries, which will impact other related fields such as quantum optics, theoretical atomic and molecular physics, coherent control, atmospheric chemistry, chemical imaging and radiation chemistry."
0.290492,"Sound generation in wind instruments such as the recorder, flute, and trumpet involves the motion of a compressible fluid (air). This motion can be extremely complicated, and can lead to vortex formation and other phenomena found in strongly driven fluids. Such complex fluid motion is generally found in the mouthpiece of a wind instrument or near constrictions such as toneholes, where experimental observations are most difficult. This project will use advanced computational methods to study the fluid dynamics of air inside and around several wind instruments. This fluid motion is directly responsible for sound generation, so the results of this study will lead to a better understanding of the musical tones produced by a variety of wind instruments. The computational results will also be compared, where possible, with experimental results obtained with custom made instruments as part of this project or through the experimental work of other groups. The undergraduate and graduate students who will be involved in this project will engage in experimental work and will also work on the modeling. This modeling experience will prepare them for careers in advanced scientific computing, since the methods used to solve the Navier-Stokes for a musical instrument are applicable to many problems of technological interest.<br/><br/>The physical laws that describe the fluid dynamics central to wind instruments are well known. These laws are expressed in the Navier-Stokes equations, a set of nonlinear partial differential equations which are applicable to many situation involving fluid flow . The complexity of the Navier-Stokes equations is such that their application to realistic musical instruments (and other complicated systems) demands a computational solution, which is now feasible with available high performance parallel computers. This project will use the approach known as ""direct numerical simulation"" to obtain solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for a variety of wind instruments. This will be achieved using state-of-the-art computational resources and custom designed algorithms for multicore computer architectures. These computational studies will be complemented with experimental measurements designed to test specific predictions of the modeling results, leading to new insights into these instruments. Several hypothetical new instrument geometries will also be studied, work that may identify new geometries that produce specific tonal properties not found in current instruments. The techniques that are developed in this project will be applicable in all wind instruments and will therefore be of broad interest to the field of musical acoustics and beyond."
0.39,"Experimental nuclear physics helps us to understand the properties of the nuclei at the center of atoms and how the elements are synthesized in stars and their explosions. This project enhances our understanding of these fundamental questions by accelerating nuclei to high energies and measuring gamma and charged particle radiation that is emitted when they interact with other atomic nuclei. The focus is on accelerating beams of atomic nuclei that are unstable to beta decay, living for times as short as seconds. The interactions between atomic nuclei informs our understanding of the properties of atomic nuclei, especially those far from stability that are more weakly bound, as well as helping us to understand how the parents of the stable elements were synthesized. The project exploits state-of-the-art instruments and accelerator facilities in the U.S. Central to this effort is enhancing the education of students and postdoctoral scholars and preparing them for careers in education and fundamental and applied research. The nuclear physics results from this project are also of importance in astronomy, to understand the abundance of elements observed in the cosmos, and for nuclear energy and national security, to understand properties of and reactions on fragments from fission of actinides. To expand the reach of this project, the principal investigator presents workshops to undergraduate students on how to prepare for graduate studies and gives lectures to the public and schools on this research.<br/><br/>One of the frontier areas of nuclear physics is the study of the structure of atomic nuclei far from the valley of stability. In atomic nuclei the single-particle orbitals are expected to change as a function of neutron and proton number, and in addition are very sensitive to the presence of deformation. Single-particle characteristics can be probed in single-particle transfer reactions. Light-ion transfer reactions will be studied with beam energies near the Coulomb barrier and about 35-MeV per nucleon. Studies will concentrate on neutron-rich nuclei near the N=50 neutron shell closure, accelerated fragments following fission of 252Cf and light nuclei important for understanding the synthesis of nuclei in stars and their explosions. These studies will be carried out with accelerated beams of rare isotopes at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University and the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory. The NSCL focus is to extract spectroscopic strengths with reduced dependence on theoretical model parameters. At ATLAS the group will exploit Gammasphere-ORRUBA: Dual Detectors for Nuclear Structure Studies to probe the fragmentation of single-particle strength with coincidence measurements between charged particles (measured with ORRUBA, the Oak Ridge Rutgers University Barrel Array of position-sensitive silicon strip detectors) and gamma rays (measured with Gammasphere, the array of 110 Compton-suppressed Ge gamma-ray detectors). The group will also further develop capabilities to measure particle-gamma-ray coincidences with scintillator detectors coupled to ORRUBA."
0.756,"Research supported by this CAREER award is exploring new ways to use atom interferometry to perform precision tests of fundamental laws of physics. An atom interferometer uses the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics. An atomic (e.g., cesium) matter wave is split and sent along two paths. When the two waves are interfered, the probability of detecting the atom is given by the phase difference of the matter waves. The high sensitivity of atom interferometers derives from the fact that the phase difference can be millions of radians, whereas tiny fractions of radians lead to a measurable change in the detection probability. The instruments being constructed for this research use cesium and lithium atoms. They use ""large momentum transfer,"" a new method that allows attaining a large separation of the matter wave's paths, thus increasing sensitivity. This method is further improved as part of this research.<br/><br/>The instruments are applied to pursue an exciting research agenda in fundamental physics: Measuring a fundamental constant that characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction, known as the fine structure constant, and thereby testing the theory of quantum electrodynamics to high precision; testing the notion that the force of gravitation must obey the laws of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, such as the fact that gravity knows no preferred direction; and testing the universality of free fall, one of the fundamental ingredients of the Einstein Equivalence Principle, from which all of General Relativity follows. Undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs take part, so this research helps training the next generation of scientists and engineers. The PI has noted that deep involvement in research often starts at a rather late stage of the student's career. The PI therefore seeks to increase the participation of undergraduate students, and in fact one of the interferometers used for this research has been set up mainly by an undergraduate student."

Before the end of this award period, Advanced LIGO may open a new, revolutionary window on the universe that will probe some of the most energetic and mysterious phenomena in the sky, from merger of black holes and explosions of supernovae to the internal structure of neutron stars. Gravitational-wave astronomy will allow scientists to see the universe from a novel and unique perspective, providing astrophysical insights that are not accessible with conventional telescopes. This research delivers vital contributions to Advanced LIGO's scientific core mission while strengthening LIGO's commitment to improving science education among diverse and underserved segments of the population, the youth and the general public. The success of the Advanced LIGO endeavor will have broader impacts in physics, astronomy, technology and engineering through the project's multiple spin offs. Research under this award will encourage the growth of scientific advancement in the southeast region of the United States, increase educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and enhance diversity in science. <br/><br/>The activities funded through this award support Advanced LIGO research during detector commissioning and early science data taking phases.

0.097513,"The response of a physical system to incoming electromagnetic radiation or charged particles is one of the most basic properties of nature of utter importance to both fundamental and applied sciences along with a wide variety of technological applications. Despite numerous studies of these processes performed to date, the current understanding of them is far from complete. This is because the processes are multifaceted in the richness of phenomena that might occur, and are extremely difficult for theory to embrace all of them, or even some of them. In this project, the understanding of the structure and spectra of free and confined atoms and their interactions with incoming electromagnetic radiation or charged particles will be advanced. In the project, confined atoms of interest are defined as atoms which are embedded into hollow interiors of various gas-phase fullerenes Cn or other types of penetrable and impenetrable confinements with varying heights and widths, as well as positioned near planar or non-planar graphitic nano-structures. New trends in the cross sections of corresponding processes of photon absorption and collision of the incoming electrons with confined and free atoms will be unveiled. For free atoms, this will be achieved by accounting for the interactions mixing a 'pure' vacancy state (such, e.g., as 5s in Ba) or 'pure' incoming particle state with dominant (to be determined in the project) higher order continuous state excitations in a number of atoms, in the first hand in Ba and Mn; so far, the needed understanding is lacking. For confined atoms, new trends in their spectra will be unraveled by accounting for individual and combined effects brought about by the above specified confinements of different properties and geometry, by varying positions of the confined atom inside a confinement, and by accounting for multielectron interactions (electron correlation) in the atom itself. Hartree-Fock approximation, random phase approximation with exchange, methods of many-body perturbation theory, etc., will be employed in, or adjusted to, the stated studies. The intellectual merit of activities to be performed is determined by the fact that to date there is little knowledge on how the individual and combined effects of nano-scaled confinements of different symmetries (spherical, non-spherical, homogeneous, inhomogeneous, planar, non-planar, etc.) may alter the structure and spectra of confined in, or positioned near them atoms. Also, to date, there remains a lack of understanding of the interactions mixing pure vacancy/particle states in an atom with its higher order excitations. Moreover, results of the project will identify some of the most interesting and/or useful future measurements/calculations which could be performed, both for free and confined atoms, thereby contributing synergy to advancement of the field. <br/><br/>On a broader impact scale, the involvement and active participation of undergraduate students in this project will strengthen integration of research and education at the University. Furthermore, the project will enhance the research infrastructure in the University. Results of research will be disseminated broadly to scientific community and general public for a broader awareness of science. Society will benefit from the performed activities by gaining new fundamental knowledge on phenomena of nature with important applications, and by the training of students who, early in their careers, will have acquired a unique professional experience for entry into graduate study in physics or scientific and engineering careers. All of the above will significantly contribute to the benefit, health, vitality of science and engineering, and the prosperity of society."
0.435,"The research proposed here is primarily for two projects. The first is a search for a type of particle known as a scalar meson, which has the same quantum numbers as a theoretical particle called the ""glueball"". The latter is conjectured to be a bound system of only gluons, which are the force-carrying particles in the theory of QCD (quantum chromodynamics). In practice, real particles are a quantum-mechanical mixture of scalar mesons and the hypothetical glueball, so studying the properties of the scalar mesons gives a direct connection with the predictions of QCD. Scalar mesons have been observed in some hadron-beam experiments, but there is scant evidence of these mesons in photon-beam experiments like the ones proposed at Jefferson Lab. This research project will provide definitive results on scalar meson rates produced at the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab. The second project is a hadronic-beam experiment to be carried out at the J-PARC facility in Japan. This experiment will explore the production rate of final states where two pi-mesons are detected. The last data of this sort was taken back in the 1970s, and now precise data for this final state are needed as input to theoretical calculations of nucleon resonances. A nucleon resonance is an excited state of the proton, which can decay into a proton and one or more pi-mesons (or other particles). The nucleon resonance spectrum is important because it tells us about how quarks interact with each other inside the proton. The nucleon resonance spectrum can now be calculated using a theoretical technique called lattice QCD, which is based on the theory of QCD.<br/><br/>Understanding the theory of QCD (quantum chromodynamics) is one of the most important aspects of nuclear physics today. QCD is responsible for the binding of quarks inside the proton, and also for the binding of protons and neutrons inside the nucleus. Hence, QCD is essentially the theory that leads to a better understanding of nuclear energy and other nuclear applications. While today's applications of nuclear processes, such as nuclear medicine, can be understood in terms of phenomenology, the applications of the future may well depend on an understanding of QCD. Calculations based on the theory of QCD are difficult, requiring large computers, and such complex calculations need to be tested experimentally. The research proposed here is one such experimental test that can lead to a better understanding of the nuclear force. Other broader impacts resulting from this research are the training of graduate students in building leading-edge instrumentation and in computational analysis."
0.4,"1057175<br/>Staack<br/>CAREER: Micro- and Nano- Scale Plasma Discharges in High Density Fluids<br/><br/>This research will push the current boundaries of plasma physics to create and control the smallest plasma discharges. The goal is to find out how to make and to use nanoscale plasma discharges as tools for the highly localized diagnostics and modification of matter. Furthermore this proposed work will increase the exposure of the general public and future graduate student to the exciting and interdisciplinary field of plasma engineering.<br/><br/>This proposed research experimentally investigates micro- and nano- scale discharges in liquids. By using nanosecond duration voltage pulses, nanoscale electrodes, and a high density medium such as a liquid, plasma discharges as small as 10s-100s of nanometers in size can be created. Such systems are very complicated with various effects of the plasma generation including: electrophoresis, shock waves, radical species generation, non-equilibrium conditions, light emission, high pressures and high temperatures. The temporal evolution of the thermodynamic state in the small discharges will be measured and manipulated by voltage pulse control to emphasize desired effects for a particular application. Diagnostics will include sub-ns temporal resolution microscopic visualization, optical emission spectroscopy (OES), Schlieren imaging and hydrophones. The experimental results will be correlated with analytical and low-order models comparing the system to existing theories on underwater electrical and laser induced breakdown. These results will be tied into developing course material, and disseminated to students, the general public, and research peers. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The hypothesis of this research is that nanoscale plasma discharges can be created to accentuate various physical, chemical, radiative, or thermal effects by controlling the electrode size, and voltage application. This study of miniscule discharges in high density fluids pushes the limits of current low temperature plasma physics to smaller sizes and higher electron densities. Diagnostic techniques will also be developed in this new regime. Proof of concept tests for some potentially transformative applications will also be explored such as: the chemical analysis of attoliter volumes of liquids; intracellular surgery and diagnostics; maskless nanopatterning; bottom-up nanofabrication; and hydrodynamic flow control. Future potential applications of these unique small size, high energy density, and luminous systems are: nanoscale thermonuclear devices; sub-wavelength visible and UV light sources for near field optical techniques; electro-optical interconnects and, yet unexplored quantum confinement effects in nanoscale plasmas.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The study of such plasma liquid interaction and their applications is important as it is a new regime of plasma physics ripe for new technologies and discoveries. Similarly the nanoscale manipulation of materials and processes is also important. The proposed research focuses on very fundamental aspects, mechanisms and applications with nanoscale plasmas. As a novel system it also has potential for new commercial applications. To enhance educational impacts this proposal will: 1) train and exposure undergraduate, master and doctoral students in the cross disciplinary field of plasma engineering, 2) develop a new undergraduate course on Plasma Engineering including laboratory demonstrations, 3) develop a workshop and seminars on nanoscale plasmas and plasmas in liquids for several international meetings, 4) focus on increasing graduate school participation of domestic students including the underrepresented, and 5) create You-Tube and Wikipedia content to excite and inform the general public about plasmas."

This project will provide research opportunities to students with interests in physics and statistics, and help train them to become the next generation of scientists. Carleton students are eager to participate in exciting research, and their interest in gravitational wave astronomy, and science in general, is large. The computational statistical methods developed as a consequence of this project have, and will continue to have significant influence in other scientific fields: astrophysics, chaos studies, and gravitational wave detectors in space. The project will also continue to provide material that will improve teaching at the college level; subjects that will benefit from the science covered in this project include optics, general relativity, and statistics. This project also creates opportunities for scientific outreach; high school students and high school teachers will continue to be exposed to the wonder and significance of LIGO's research, and this outreach creates much excitement for science and physics. Finally, the research work of this project promotes international scientific collaboration. Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916; a century later we should actually observe gravitational waves, and consequently the scientific and educational benefit will be tremendous.<br/><br/>Events seen by LIGO will produce a wealth of astrophysical information, the extraction of which will require advanced techniques in data analysis, parameter estimation, and statistics. Detector characterization work will provide scientists with confidence in the quality of the data, and the performance of the detectors. Carleton College will continue with its significant efforts in identifying and characterizing noise in LIGO data; this information will be fed back to the interferometer operators in order to improve the detector performance. Carleton and colleagues are researching how to eliminate magnetic field noise from the Schumann resonances that is coherent in the LIGO-Virgo detector network. Carleton will use LIGO data to observe a cosmologically produced stochastic gravitational wave background. Carleton will contribute to the effort to detect long duration gravitational waves by correlating data from two detectors, and using pattern recognition techniques to look for signals. The Carleton team will develop Bayesian parameter estimation methods to extract physical parameters associated with core collapse supernova produced gravitational wave signals."
0.27,"The project studies the interaction of light (mostly lasers) and charged particles (mostly electrons) with atoms, ions, and small molecules. The results are of importance for the understanding of the fundamental collision dynamics, and they also fulfill the urgent practical need for accurate atomic data to model the physics of stars, plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres. The short-pulse intense-laser part of the project deals with accurate solutions of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation on a numerical space-time grid. With the rapid advances currently seen in computational resources, such studies for realistic rather than idealized model systems have only become possible in recent years. This work is important for further developments in imaging and ultimately controlling of submicroscopic reactions, which is expected to have broad impact by reaching out from physics to chemistry and ultimately biology. Many experimental efforts worldwide are supported through the present project, which will also train a post-doctoral associate and a number of research students in the basic understanding of the problem and the use of highly sophisticated numerical techniques.<br/><br/>Most of the numerical calculations will be based upon the non-perturbative R-matrix (close-coupling) method, as well as direct solutions of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation using various grid-based approaches and basis-function expansions. For single and double ionization of complex atoms by intense atto/femto-second laser pulses, the methods will be combined in such a way that individual parts of the ""big problem"" can be treated in highly efficient and optimized ways. This strategy will be extended to the treatment of double ionization involving inner shells as well as diatomic molecules. Of particular interest will be the highly challenging, but ultimately necessary simultaneous treatment of the nuclear and electronic motion. There are major difficulties associated with both the formulation of the problem and the subsequent numerical treatment. Much emphasis will be placed on the testing of numerical methods and the visualization of the results, both of which are ideal for student involvement."
0.11,"Many of the deepest problems in theoretical physics revolve around combining Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum theory, two of the major intellectual achievements of the twentieth century. The resulting theory is called ""quantum gravity"" and is needed to better understand the origin of the universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, what happens inside black holes, and the very origin of our universe, the big bang. By enabling graduate students and post-docs to participate in frontier physics, and to interact with other research groups, this award will have a broad and long-term impact on the development of future scientists. The results of the research will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer reviewed publication and scientific lectures, as well as to the general public through public lectures and other means.<br/><br/>Much remarkable progress in understanding the big bang has occurred through the use of loop quantum cosmology, a simplified version of loop quantum gravity which models the universe as a whole. This award seeks to bridge the gap between this simplified model and full loop quantum gravity in order to solidify confidence in the predictions of the former. This involves a number of interesting conceptual questions for which the principal investigator already has preliminary answers. A second part of this research aims to answer key questions regarding the Feynman sum-over-histories formulation of loop quantum gravity, in which space and time are treated in a more unified way, and to bring this formulation closer to completion."
0.33,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. It is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering these Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson. One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work proposed here will analyze data from the CMS experiment looking for signals of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. <br/><br/>This award will fund two aspects of the CMS experiment: 1) further searches for BSM physics and 2) help build the CMS Phase I forward pixel detector (FPix) upgrade, which will enhance the ability of CMS to discover BSM physics. BSM theoretical predictions include several different new particles in the so-called Super Symmetric (SUSY) theory. These new particles are candidates for Dark Matter. This award will fund searches for SUSY via the decays to multiple leptons (electrons or muons) and jets (the experimental signature of quarks). The SUSY particle decays in these channels also include a SUSY particle that goes right through the detector without interacting, thus the event has missing energy. Many SUSY models have been ruled out by the analysis of LHC data from 2010-2013. With the new higher energy running at LHC starting summer 2015, new analysis techniques will be applied in order to separate out SUSY (or other Dark Matter candidates) signals from large backgrounds. This involves the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) mode of production where the quark-quark collision produces a pair of vector bosons (either W or Z) which then interact (Fuse) to form new particles. The experimental signature of this VBF production is a pair of energetic jets in the forward direction in opposite hemispheres of the detector, with large di-jet mass. These jets stand out above background from SM particle decays and thus enhance the signal to background ratio in the possible discovery of BSM particles. The award also provides important parts of the FPix upgrade which are being tested at FermiLab. The CMS Forward pixel upgrade will allow the precise vertex location, needed for all physics studies, even in the harsh environment (very high luminosity) expected in near future LHC running. The CMS Forward Pixel Detector uses state-of-the art silicon technology for particle detection combined with equally sophisticated readout electronics. Innovative techniques of radiation hard technology and bump bonding have been used in the current detector to meet the real estate challenges in a high radiation environment. These techniques would greatly enhance the life span of detectors used in outer space research and improve bio-sensing miniature devices for medical applications."
0.105,"The award funds the research activities of Alakabha Datta at the University of Mississippi. <br/><br/>It is known that there are six quarks and six leptons forming the fundamental particles in Nature. The quarks are composed of three ""flavors"" with charge +2/3 (up, charm, top) and three with charge -1/3 (down, strange, bottom). These particles all mix together in the weak interaction - for example, the particle that interacts weakly with the up quark is a combination of down, strange and bottom quarks. The mixing angles and masses have all been measured precisely, but the values of the masses and mixing are completely mysterious. This is called the ""flavor puzzle"". Precision studies of some quarks and leptons, the bottom and top quark, and the tau lepton, are very, very sensitive to new physics beyond the standard model. So very precise studies of the interactions of these objects can lead to understanding new physics. That in turn can lead to expected signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The proposed project will be to explore clean ways to look for physics beyond the Standard Model in the flavor sector and to find the structure of the new physics. With the historic discovery of a new particle, the Higgs boson, by the LHC it is expected that many new particles will be found at the LHC in the near future. Information on the couplings and other properties of these particles can be obtained from measurements in the flavor sector. It is also likely that many new particles may be beyond the reach of the LHC in which case information on these particles can be indirectly obtained from flavor physics. The educational activities will involve training of graduate students. An effort will be made to inform the general public and underrepresented groups in science about the relevance and importance of quantum mechanics and particle physics research via talks. There will be efforts to involve undergraduate and high school students in mini projects connected to the PI's research.<br/><br/>The aim of the project will be to look for new physics in various flavor sectors that include the b quark sector, the top quark sector and the tau neutrino and tau lepton sectors. The proposed research activities of the project will focus on the decays of the b quark that offer excellent probes of new physics that may or may not be within reach of the LHC. In particular b decays may offer clues to possible flavor changing interactions of the newly discovered Higgs boson at the LHC. The project will study the properties of new physics in b decays with special emphasis on B --> VV decays where V is a vector meson, in decays mediated by the quark level transition b --> s l^+l^- where l is a charged lepton and in the semileptonic decays b --> c({u})tau nu_tau decays.The project will probe the effects of new physics in top production and decays via CP violating observables. Finally, this project plans to look for new physics in the third generation lepton sector. The proposal will explore methods for finding and constraining non standard neutrino interactions (NSI) from neutrino oscillation and neutrino scattering data, specially involving the nu_tau and tau leptons. An important input in this investigation will be to properly take into account hadronic effects in obtaining bounds on NSI interactions. This is a theory project and various tools employed by theoretical particle physicists will be used in the project, such as mathematical calculations, numerical analysis, numerical simulation, and data fitting."
0.705,"This award funds a collaborative research program involving two separate angular correlation measurements with neutrons. These measurements will enable us to extract fundamental information concerning the weak interaction which causes neutron decay, including the axial coupling constant of the nucleon. This coupling constant appears in a very wide variety of nuclear and particle physics contexts, from being a critical input to high precision calculations of the solar fusion rates, to being a target for higher precison lattice QCD calculations, to placing, together with the neutron lifetime, limits on the existence of new particle physics interactions. <br/><br/>The first experiment, UCNA, measures the beta-asymmetry, or the correlation between the neutron polarization and the decay beta-particle's momentum. UCNA is the first experiment to use ultracold neutrons, or neutrons with energies below about 300 neV that can be stored in material bottles, for this kind of measurement. Ultracold neutrons have advantages both for neutron polarimetry and neutron-generated backgrounds, key sources of systematic error in existing neutron angular correlation experiments. The UCNA experiment is currently operating, with one more run period planned at the neutron densities currently available at the Los Alamos ultracold neutron source. The targeted precision is below 0.4%, roughly a factor of 2 more precise than the current world average for the beta-asymmetry. The second experiment, Nab, uses an unpolarized beam of cold neutrons (with temperatures near 30K) to measure the electron-neutrino angular correlation, with a planned sensitivity at about the 0.1% level for the electron-neutrino correlation. This experiment should also be able to place important limits on extensions to the standard model of particle physics for scalar and <br/>tensor couplings. <br/><br/>Key to the success of these experiments is the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral scholars. These young scientists will receive excellent training in experimental techniques, particle detectors, and data analysis."
0.310095,"The fundamental goal of nuclear science is to understand all forms of nuclear matter, e.g., the origin and structure of the nucleus at core of the atom, and the nucleons and their quark and gluon constituents which account for nearly all of the mass of the visible universe. Over the last decade, hard exclusive reactions have emerged as a class of processes providing novel information on the parton (quark and gluon) distributions in hadrons - the particles sensitive to the strong force. Factorization theorems allow for expressing amplitudes in terms of the Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), which are expected to provide a universal description of nucleon structure in both momentum and coordinate space. Experimentally, access to the transverse spatial structure relies on asymptotic freedom, allowing the hard interaction of the experimental probe with one parton to be unambiguously separated from the residual soft interaction of the struck parton with the rest of the hadron. In a kinematic regime where hard-soft factorization applies, exclusive measurements of a photon or meson originating from the struck parton can be used to create a tomographic image of the nucleon. This project plays an important role in these studies, specifically through the PI's exclusive photon and meson production experiments at Jefferson Lab, which will be essential for a reliable interpretation of the results from the GPD program at both 6 GeV and 12 GeV. <br/><br/>Young scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students play an integral part in this project, which provides them with opportunities to further their training and education. These will include the opportunity to gain experience in the design, assembly, and testing of modern instrumentation for the detection of radiation and subatomic particles, fast signal processing electronics, and scientific data analysis. Furthermore, learning to work in a large international scientific community will prepare young scientists and students for the modern work environment at academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry. The PI's research projects have contributed significantly to the education of graduate and undergraduate, and, over the past three years, ten high school students. She has considerable experience working with minority students, and by providing a female role model, she could encourage women to pursue advanced studies in physics."
0.19,"A novel class of ultra-precise atomic clocks based on highly-charged ions will be developed. Such clocks hold an intriguing promise of extending the frontiers of precision measurements. Atomic clocks have both practical (navigation, geodesy, and network synchronization) and fundamental applications. Additionally, advanced tools of computational atomic physics will be used to establish powerful constraints on postulated, but so-far undiscovered exotic interactions related to dark matter and dark forces. Such constraints are unique and at the same time complementary to those derived from particle colliders, such as LHC.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out in Nevada, one of the EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) states, underrepresented in the scientific enterprize. This fulfills one of the strategic goals of the NSF to 'broaden participation and enhance diversity in NSF programs'; research and education of a graduate student partially supported with the goal of 'advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning'.

0.208959,"The Standard Model (SM) is a theory that describes fundamental particles in nature and the interactions between them. While the SM has been successful in explaining many phenomena observed in the laboratory to date, it offers no insight into experimental facts such as the dominance of matter over anti-matter, nor the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which are associated with the rotation curves of the galaxies and the accelerated expansion of the universe. Searching for physics beyond the Standard Model is therefore a well-motivated and important task for physicists. A good way to search for new physics is through tests of fundamental symmetries in different interactions.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to test fundamental symmetries in the electromagnetic and strong interactions via precision measurements on the properties of neutral particles: neutral pion and eta. The radiative decay width of the neutral pion plays a key role that bridges chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking and our understanding of QCD (a theory describing the strong interaction). On the other hand, the measurement of the eta radiative decay width will reveal the effect of explicit symmetry breakings of chiral symmetry, isospin, and SU(3) by the light-quark masses. In addition, the measurements of branching ratios or upper limits for various rare and forbidden decays of the eta will provide sensitive probes to test the violations of charge conjugation C, parity P, and time reversal T, as well as CP symmetries, and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The results of this project will provide clues to some important questions, such as: ""why is our observed universe dominated by matter over anti-matter?"", and ""what are the masses of the light quarks?""<br/><br/>This project will engage undergraduate students as key contributors. It will create a research-enriched learning environment, explore new approaches to recruiting prospective students, and develop new courses which are research related. Students working in an international collaboration will enhance their international experience and gain global perspectives."
0.279923,"The neutron is a key building block of ordinary matter, but when freed from the confines of an atom the neutron is unstable and decays into other elementary particles: a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino (a lightweight neutral particle), with an average lifetime of about 15 minutes. Neutron decay is a useful laboratory for studying details of the force responsible - the weak nuclear force - one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This award will support an experiment in which beams of free neutrons pass through specialized detectors that precisely measure the neutron decay lifetime and the angles between the emitted particles. From these results the scientists can test and refine the theory of the weak nuclear force and better understand the physics of the sun, stars, the Big Bang, and important nuclear reactions. This work, at the ""precision frontier"" of particle and nuclear physics, complements research at the ""high energy frontier"", for example at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe. This project is also an excellent opportunity to train undergraduate and graduate students in the general methods and theory of neutron science that are applicable to diverse fields in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology research at major neutron sources around the world.<br/><br/>The beta decay of the free neutron is the prototype semileptonic weak interaction and simplest nuclear beta decay. There are no complications from nuclear structure, and the decay energy is small compared to the nucleon mass so recoil-order weak form factors enter below the 0.1% level. Therefore neutron decay is an attractive system for precise low energy weak interaction measurements. The neutron lifetime establishes the time scale and temperature of nucleon ""freeze out"" shortly after the Big Bang, which sets the neutron to proton ratio during the era of primordial nucleosynthesis and hence the helium abundance, and indirectly constrains the effective number of light neutrinos. The electron-antineutrino correlation ""a"" gives lambda, the ratio of axial vector (GA) and vector (GV) weak nucleon couplings. With the neutron lifetime it can be used to determine Vud, the first element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, and constrain new physics beyond the Standard Model such as weak scalar and tensor forces. The present experimental situations with both the neutron lifetime and lambda are unsatisfactory, there is relatively poor agreement among previous measurements. The proposed program consists of three projects: 1) A continuation of the aCORN experiment at the NIST Center for Neutron Research toward an ultimate goal of measuring ""a"" to < 0.5% uncertainty (a factor of 10 improvement); 2) a phased program to improve the neutron lifetime measurement using the beam method; and 3) development of a 3He gas scintillation absolute neutron flux counter to support the neutron lifetime program."
0.186555,"Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSN) are catastrophic events that mark the death of massive stars and these violent explosions are responsible for most of the elements in the Periodic Table. The theory of gravity developed by Newton is not sufficient to describe the extreme densities in the CCSN mechanism. As such, CCSN represent an excellent test bed for Einstein's theory of gravity. This project will advance the description of gravity in current CCSN models, from an essentially Newtonian description with a simple correction accounting for some Einsteinian effects to a far more sophisticated approximation of Einsteinian gravity, thereby improving significantly the realism of future CCSN studies. The new models will be used to make predictions for the emission of gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time, in core collapse supernovae. Such supernovae are among the three primary sources that will produce gravitational waves detectable by the Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The PI will work closely with members of the LIGO Collaboration to develop new tools for LIGO data analysis. This project will train a graduate student in CCSN theory and gravitational wave astronomy and will provide a research opportunity for an intern in the Fisk-Vanderbilt Ph.D. program.<br/><br/>Advanced multi-physics models of core collapse supernovae that include multi-frequency neutrino transport with a complete set of neutrino weak interactions and key relativistic corrections such as gravitational redshift, have implemented to date only an effective self-gravitational potential, which is computed using the Newtonian potential obtained by solving the Poisson equation with a correction to the monopole term. The latter is determined from an integral formulation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation using angle-average densities. More realistic CCSN models require more sophisticated treatments of the general relativistic gravity. In this project, the PI and his students will implement the Conformally Flat Approximation in CCSN models. This approximation has been shown to describe well general relativistic gravity in systems without rapid rotation or black hole formation, suitable for most CCSN studies. The new models will be used to compute the emission of gravitational radiation in CCSN models using the weak-field, slow-motion approximation and will provide new gravitational wave data to the gravitational wave astronomy community."
0.12,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Noah Graham at Middlebury College. <br/><br/>Microelectromechanical devices --- tiny machines that can be embedded within an integrated circuit chip --- can trigger car airbags in a collision, detect the movement of a video-game controller or the orientation of a smartphone, sense low air pressure in a car tire, and provide the feedback necessary to stabilize car suspensions and flying drones. As these devices shrink toward sizes of a micron or smaller, a special quantum-mechanical force called the Casimir force will begin to play an important role in their design and function. In contrast to the more familiar electric attraction and repulsion between opposite and like charges, the Casimir force arises from quantum-mechanical fluctuations inherent in Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. While the physical mechanism underlying the Casimir force has been well understood for many years, until recently precise calculations were only possible for the most elementary examples. New techniques, in which the Casimir force is expressed in terms of information about the reflection of light from each individual object on which the force is acting, have greatly expanded the range of potential applications. The research supported by this grant will formulate and implement numerical calculations of this scattering data, making it possible to calculate Casimir forces in a broad range of systems relevant to experimental physics and nanotechnology. These general-purpose computational tools will also be applicable to other problems in science and engineering. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science with many potential technological implications. And because this approach is centered around fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics and electromagnetism, it will be possible for undergraduate students to make meaningful contributions to this research at the same time as they build scientific and computational skills that will serve them well in graduate or professional work, both within physics and across a wide range of fields in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The technical approach to this problem will be based on the variable phase method, which this research program is applying for the first time to electromagnetic scattering. High-performance parallel computation will make it possible to go beyond objects with a high degree of symmetry to calculate full T-matrices in multichannel scattering, for materials with position- and frequency-dependent dielectric response. These tools will then be applied to calculations of Casimir forces in cases of current experimental interest, such as dielectric gratings with deep corrugations, for which existing techniques based on the Rayleigh expansion are insufficient."
6.575,"This award provides support for the Nuclear Science Laboratory (NSL) at the University of Notre Dame for an experimental program in low energy nuclear physics. The program is primarily focused on critical issues in nuclear astrophysics, addressing questions about fusion reactions in stars and stellar explosions, how they produce the energy that is released and how they build up all the elements that are observed in our universe. A broad experimental agenda is planned to measure these reactions in the NSL laboratory using a number of different experimental techniques and accelerators. Nuclear reactions that drive stellar explosions will also be studied at larger scale laboratories that can provide rare ion beams that are not available at the NSL facilities. These efforts will primarily take place at Argonne National Laboratory and at the National Super Conducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. <br/><br/>The second mission of the laboratory is the study of the structure of the nucleus. Here the planned experiments focus on measuring the behavior and characteristics of nuclear matter, ranging from mapping special vibrational modes to the incompressibility of matter. These measurements will primarily be done at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics in Osaka, Japan, since no comparable US facility is presently available. <br/><br/>The third goal of this work is to further develop a broad program of nuclear science applications by focusing on high sensitivity methods such as Accelerator Mass Spectrometry and x- and gamma ray spectroscopy. These techniques benefit a broad array of academic fields, including astrophysics, geology, biology, archaeology, and history. Finally, the research provides a rich, hands-on environment for training undergraduate and graduate students in nuclear science, who will then have skills applicable to homeland security and other critical areas."
0.093424,"This award will address important questions regarding the mathematical foundations of physical theories: solutions to the Euler equations in Fluid Dynamics; the Cauchy problem for relativistic dissipative fluids; the Penrose inequality in General Relativity; and effective potentials in String Theory. It also addresses the issue of compactness of solutions to the Yamabe problem on manifolds with non-umbilic boundary. Understanding the convergence of solutions of the free boundary Euler equations to solutions of the standard Euler equations in a fixed domain will provide mathematical justification to several approximating schemes used in the Applied Sciences. It may also give useful hints on how to improve such schemes. There have been important developments in Astrophysics and Cosmology which deal with relativistic viscous fluids. It is therefore paramount to give a proper mathematical treatment of the Cauchy problem describing these situations. The Penrose inequality is a longstanding open problem in the physics of gravitation. Proving it in different situations is an important step towards establishing the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, which in turn can be viewed as a test for the consistency of General Relativity. Effective potentials are among the most promising approaches to construct realistic models in String Theory. Finally, the study of compactness of solutions to the Yamabe problem on manifolds with non-umbilic boundary is an important extension of the results known so far. All these problems are extensions of previous work done by the PI and collaborators. <br/>Broader impact: All problems described in this project will certainly lead to new interactions between Physics and Mathematics, as well as the development of new techniques which will undoubtedly have applications to other problems in Physics, Analysis and Geometry. The techniques developed to study the Cauchy problem in relativistic dissipative fluids will likely be applicable to other problems in the field of Partial Differential Equations. The proof of compactness of solutions to the Yamabe problem for manifolds with non-umbilic boundary will require an analogue of the Weyl Vanishing Theorem for the umbilicity tensor. A recent proof of the charged Penrose inequality given by the PI and M. A. Khuri relies on the introduction of a new quasi-local mass tailored to electrically charged initial data sets. Its generalization can potentially bring new insights to the broader issue of mass in General Relativity. The last decades have seen an extremely fruitful exchange between Geometry and String Theory, and the study of effective potentials is certain to provide new avenues for this interaction. The ideas of this project will also reach an audience outside the PI immediate field of expertise through their dissemination via topics courses, seminars etc. Finally, one hopes that some of the outcomes of this project will eventually help the task of building an ever more scientifically educated society. In the age of the Large Hadron Collider, where popular books and TV shows present the general public with concepts like black holes, giant stars and extra dimensions, keeping track of the mathematical and logical solidity of our physical theories can help citizens to decide what to take as well-established science versus ideas which have yet to meet the standards of academic rigor."

This research program is motivated by the pressing need to understand how core-collapse supernovae work. It is known that these extreme events are connected to the collapse of massive stars, but it has not yet been clearly established how the initial collapse is reversed and turned into an explosion. An observation of the next galactic core-collapse supernova by Advanced LIGO and by neutrino observatories may shed light on the supernova phenomenon and this research project strives towards creating the theoretical foundation for the interpretation of such signals.

0.225,"The spectroscopic measurement of transition frequencies in simple atomic systems has significantly contributed to the progress of physics within the last 100 years. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom was developed on the basis of the quantum-classical correspondence of planetary orbits under the influence of the central electrostatic potential generated by the positively charged proton, with the additional ingredient of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition. The theory has been refined over decades, with additional input from relativistic physics and quantum field theory. By analyzing the spectrum ever more carefully, one has been able to deduce from the experiments a few subtle properties of the atoms, such as the charge radius of the massive central particle, i.e., the proton. Recently, an experiment has been performed which questions the understanding of the field-theoretical modifications of the Coulomb force law at short distances: The so-called muonic hydrogen experiment at the Paul-Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, has been obtaining results for transitions in the bound system of muon and proton, which are in disagreement with other experiments and theoretical calculations performed by the physics community over at least two decades. Within the NSF program, some of the last conceivable explanations for the ensuing proton radius puzzle will be studied from the theoretical side, with the aim of either excluding these explanations, or finding confirmation for necessary modifications of our understanding of the nuclear charge distribution within the proton.<br/><br/>Based on the PI's somewhat broad knowledge in field theory, the concepts and ideas originally developed in the analysis of bound-state corrections will be applied to so-called dynamical processes and atom-surface interactions. When an atom is in contact with a dielectric surface, the vacuum modes of the electric field are perturbed in the immediate vicinity of the surface. The quantum fluctuations (the unavoidable 'quiver' due to the Heisenberg uncertainty relation) of the vacuum modes (the 'preferred natural oscillation modes' of the electric field in the vicinity of the metallic surface) change the interaction potential of the atom near the surface, and the 'dragging' of the mirror charge inside the dielectric material induces a friction force. This happens even if the atom is not in physical contact with the surface, and the overlap of the quantum mechanical wave function of the atom with the surface is negligible. These effects are due to be studied within the NSF research program, and compared to the results of ongoing experiments in various laboratories in the world. Finally, all of these effects will be studied for few-electron atoms, for which the energy eigenvalues of the basic quantum mechanical time evolution operator (the 'Hamiltonian' which defines the energy levels) cannot be calculated in analytic form. Ideas to improve approximation methods based on novel basis sets ('quantum mechanical trial wave functions') will be explored. <br/><br/>All of the research endeavors sketched above are suited for the education of graduate students. Indeed, both the gain in the knowledge on basic, but also applied physics as well the education in the use of advanced numerical methods contributes to the success of a number of graduate students supervised in the past (and, one may envisage, present and future). This includes the numerical methods used in the study of bound systems as well as other, more mathematically inclined concepts, based on the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields, which often find surprising, practically useful applications.<br/><br/>There are three major areas of work in this project. The first problem is the puzzle of the muonic hydrogen and proton radius. The muonic hydrogen puzzle continues to intrigue physicists and represents one of the most pressing questions to answer in regard to our understanding of fundamental forces. Namely, measurements in muonic hydrogen have led to a value of the proton charge radius which is in disagreement with both scattering experiments as well as laser-spectroscopic measurements in atomic hydrogen. This project involves the recalculation of one of the last possible theoretical explanations for the disagreement which has not yet been fully covered in the literature. The second problem involves higher order corrections in many-body systems. Beyond the two-body problem, it is impossible to analytically solve bound-state systems even in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Three aspects of higher-order corrections in helium-like systems which are of prime importance for the description of experiments will be studied. These include so-called relativistic Bethe logarithms in helium, as well as higher-order effects in the bound 'muonic helium' system. The calculations will be important in confronting the muonic hydrogen puzzle with other muonic bound systems, and, potentially, in determining the electron-muon mass ratio. Finally, Casimir effects, dynamic processes and atom-wall interactions will be studied. The atom-wall interaction is a vacuum-mediated interaction between an atom flying by a solid material ('wall') and depends on the functional form of the dielectric response function of the medium. The project includes an investigation, conceivably in collaboration with experimentalists, of the temperature dependence of the atom-wall interaction, which may have already been seen in an experiment, as well as details of the atom-wall interaction potential for the helium-alpha-quartz and helium-gold systems. Theoretical progress on the understanding of the quantum friction force, due to the dragging of the mirror charge inside the wall, also forms part of the current ject.<br/><br/>The cross-disciplinary proposal combines atomic theory and quantum-field theory in the low-energy domain to address fundamentally important questions and pressing current experimental-theoretical discrepancies. Advanced numerical methods and the education of graduate students and the development of postdoctoral research associates are cornerstones of the investigations. Potential applications of some of the developed numerical methods, beyond those devised for atomic-physics calculations, are currently being envisaged."
0.250847,"H3+ is the simplest molecule with more than two atoms: it consists of three protons bound by two electrons. As such, it is an ideal benchmark system for testing state-of-the-art theoretical calculations of molecular energy levels. H3+ is significant not only for these fundamental reasons, but also because it has been widely observed in a variety of astronomical environments, including the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn and in clouds of gas between stars. These observations are made by precisely determining the colors of light that are emitted by the molecule, a technique called ""spectroscopy"". The latest calculations can reproduce the colors of H3+ to within the accuracy of current laboratory spectroscopy measurements, so further progress in theoretical development will require improvements in the laboratory instrumentation. The group supported by this grant plans to utilize a novel instrument that will allow them to measure H3+ colors to a precision that is 10,000 times better than previous work. The resulting dataset will serve as an enduring benchmark for high-level theoretical calculations, and will also assist astronomical observations of this important molecule. In the long run, it is anticipated that this work will help in the development of improved methods of controlling chemical reactions and thereby advance a significant fraction of the industrial sector.<br/><br/>The work will use a recently-constructed instrument that allows routine sub-Doppler spectroscopy of molecular ions. This instrument will be upgraded to achieve a precision of approximately 30 kiloHertz, or one-millionth of a wavenumber, and then used to record high-precision spectra of H3+ in the mid-infrared. An analysis using combination differences and effective Hamiltonian fitting will be used to produce a set of experimentally determined energy levels of H3+, with a precision that is approximately four orders of magnitude better than previous work. These precise energy levels will permit the direct testing of non-adiabatic corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, various empirical corrections, and ultimately calculations of the Lamb shift for H3+."
0.03216,"When a massive star reaches the end of its life, the core of the star collapses, producing a supernova. While visually spectacular, less than 1% of the energy in the supernova is released as visible light or as kinetic energy in the surrounding environment. Most of the energy from the supernova is released in neutrinos, which are small particles that only interact weakly with matter. The neutrino emission from a supernova precedes the emission of visible light by a few minutes up to many hours. Detecting the first neutrinos from a supernova therefore provides an early alert to trigger further observations. The SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) is a network of neutrino detectors around the world designed to provide automated early alerts for supernovae in our galaxy. While rare, a galactic supernova would provide a unique opportunity to study the physics of core-collapse supernova, as well as the properties of neutrinos. The early alerts from SNEWS will enable observations of the earliest phases of the supernova for physicists and astronomers around the world. The SNEWS project works to engage amateur astronomers, who may play an important role in optical observations of supernova, and to involve them in the science of supernova. <br/><br/>SNEWS involves neutrino detectors around the world: Super-K, Large Volume Detector, IceCube, Borexino, KAMLand, and Daya Bay. If any of the participating experiments finds a burst of events, it sends a datagram to the central SNEWS computer located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, with a backup located in Bologna. If a coincidence is found within 10 seconds, a supernova alert will be sent out. SNEWS has been operational since 1998, and has been running in a fully-automated mode since 2005 with near-100% up-time. This award will provide funds to maintain the SNEWS system, support undergraduate researchers participating in the project, and expand connections to the astronomical community."
0.147496,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. A primary area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), and are the subject of this investigation. This research will involve the work of undergraduate students at an RUI. <br/><br/>This award supports work, using the neutrino beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), on three related neutrino experiments: MINERvA, Nova and MINOS+, all measuring neutrino oscillations: muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions. To correctly measure these transitions, precise knowledge of neutrino interactions is required. This award will be used to measure (using the MINERvA detector) these interactions across a wide energy range available at FNAL. This will improve our knowledge of the neutrino flux, useful for future Short Baseline (detector near the source at FNAL) and Long Baseline (detector hundreds of kilometers away) experiments as well as the current Nova experiment. The work on the MINOS+ experiment will help map out the shape of the energy dependence of the neutrino oscillation probability, which could reveal new anomalies in the neutrino sector. A number of BSM proposed phenomena, from sterile neutrinos to extra dimensions, can cause measurable deviations in the neutrino oscillation probability in the 4-10GeV range.<br/>A special contribution of this award and an exciting broader impact of this research program is the development and implementation of 3D visualization tools to guide the physics analyses of the experiments and to render visible to students and the public the nature of neutrino interactions as recorded and studied by scientists."
0.089999,"Complex plasmas, also known as dusty plasmas, consist of ions, electrons and charged dust, tiny solid particles much smaller than the width of a human hair. Dusty plasmas have long been of interest in the astrophysics community, due to the fact that dust and ionized gas are found in most space environments, including the clouds from which stars and planets form, comet tails, planetary rings, and noctilucent clouds in the earth's ionosphere. Dusty plasmas are also present on Earth in applied settings. They are formed in the chemically active gases used in industrial plasma processing devices to create computer chips, contaminating the end product and reducing overall yield. Dust contamination within fusion devices is also an issue, since dust produced through erosion of the containment walls raises both safety (operating instabilities) and health (long-term contamination) concerns. The formation of dust crystals, clusters and strings in laboratory plasmas has also proven to be a capable analog for atomic and molecular systems. <br/><br/>Charging of dust grains is a unique and important aspect of dusty plasmas. Understanding the physics behind this charging and subsequent formation of dust structures immersed within plasma has proven to require nuanced details. The charge acquired by the dust grains is determined by the plasma environment, but the charged particles in turn influence this environment. Local variations in the charge, either over the surface of a single dust grain or the multiple dust grains comprising a larger structure, can affect both the grain's local dynamics and the evolution of the overall system. Many situations introduce asymmetries into this problem, making the charge difficult to describe analytically. Complicating factors include variations in space (due to geometry of the dust structure or of the plasma environment) as well as variations in time (due to the response of the plasma to the moving dust grains or stochastic charging processes). The dust charge is also extremely difficult to determine in experiments. Thus, the primary objective of this research is to determine how variations in charge in both time and space influence and respond to the dynamics and configuration of dust particles in plasma environments.<br/><br/>In order to accomplish this goal, numerical modeling techniques will be combined with laboratory experiments to provide a proper understanding of the processes governing the system behavior. Numerical models will be used to model temporal and spatial charge variation over the dust structures, including stochastic effects to resolve the variations in time due to the discrete nature of the plasma particles. The charging will also be linked to numerical models of the plasma environment which define the response of the plasma to boundary conditions and the dust itself. Simultaneously, laboratory experiments will employ state-of-the-art techniques to control and confine the dust within dust clouds, strings, clusters, and aggregates in order to use them as in situ probes to measure the local plasma environment."

However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. It is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering these Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson. One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work proposed here will analyze data from the CMS experiment looking for signals of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. <br/><br/>This award will fund two aspects of the CMS experiment: 1) further searches for BSM physics and 2) help build the CMS Phase I forward pixel detector (FPix) upgrade, which will enhance the ability of CMS to discover BSM physics. Some of the BSM theoretical predictions include several different Higgs boson that have enhanced coupling to b-quarks. This award will allow an improved b-quark study using a multivariate regression technique to better estimate the b-jet energy scale and thereby improve on the Higgs boson mass resolution. This so-called jet substructure technique is important for all the physics results coming out of CMS, as many decay channels require improved jet energy corrections. Another BSM search that this award provides is the search for a heavy vector boson (generally referred to as Z prime) predicted to decay to a ttbar pair of quarks. The final state of this ttbar decay is b-jets, again, benefiting from the jet energy correction work in this award. The award also provides important parts of the FPix upgrade which are being tested at FermiLab. The CMS Forward pixel upgrade will allow the precise vertex location, needed for all physics studies, even in the harsh environment (very high luminosity) expected in near future LHC running. The CMS Forward Pixel Detector uses state-of-the art silicon technology for particle detection combined with equally sophisticated readout electronics. Innovative techniques of radiation hard technology and bump bonding have been used in the current detector to meet the real estate challenges in a high radiation environment. These techniques would greatly enhance the life span of detectors used in outer space research and improve bio-sensing miniature devices for medical applications."
0.14,"Nuclear astrophysics is the study of how elements are created in various stellar environments and how such environments evolve. For example, stellar burning is responsible for the production of elements up to iron, and neutron capture processes create most of the heavy elements. However, the origin of heavy, proton-rich nuclei above iron is one of the greatest puzzles of stellar nucleosynthesis. The most likely scenario for creating these isotopes is the p-process: a complex network of photodisintegration reactions and their inverse (proton-, alpha- and neutron-capture) that occur during the explosion of a supernova. A vast network of 20,000 nuclear reactions for the p-process relies on models to provide input of nuclear properties and reaction rates for all the nuclei involved in the network. The goal of this project is to identify the reactions that are key for the p-process and to measure them directly, so as to minimize the uncertainty for those rates and provide constraints for the model predictions. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to understanding of the stellar p-process by measuring cross sections for proton and alpha capture reactions of relevance for Pd-102, Cd-108, Cd-110, Te-120 and Te-122. Those reactions have not been measured before, and have been identified as key for the p-process by two independent sensitivity studies. Studies have shown that the variations of those rates within the current model uncertainties have a significant impact on the production of the p-nuclei. The project will utilize a newly purchased detector (HECTOR) to employ the &#947;-summing technique. The impact of the measured reaction rates on the final abundances of the p-nuclei will be verified using network calculations whose results will be compared with the solar abundances. Additionally, the measured cross sections will be compared with model predictions and will be used to identify the model inputs that best reproduce the data."
0.43,"It is a well-established fact that protons and neutrons are made up of smaller constituents called quarks and gluons. In collisions using two beams of heavy nuclei, a new state of matter is formed, called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). This project will answer fundamental questions about the QGP, such as how matter is transformed from a collection of protons and neutrons to a free state where quarks and gluons can travel through space unhindered, much like they did in the primordial soup of matter following the Big Bang. Experiments will be carried out at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located in Geneva, Switzerland. In order to look for signatures of how the transition to the QGP phase has occurred for a given beam energy, the Ohio State group will study the numbers of particles produced in the collisions along with the distribution and correlations of particle momenta. <br/><br/>The goals for the high-energy program are three-fold. Firstly, to study the space-time properties of this extremely dense matter created in collisions between heavy nuclei at the highest achievable energies. The second is to study the bulk phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), believed to be the correct theory of the Strong interaction between quarks and gluons. This will be achieved by varying the conditions of the collision to lower energies, to probe the transition(s) between confined and deconfined matter. In particular, the group will perform a novel analysis as a function of the collision energy, measuring coordinate-space anisotropies and dynamics. Thirdly, they will take the tools developed to study bulk physics in heavy ion collisions, and apply them to proton- proton collisions at similar energies. They will look particularly for collective behavior (flow) in these collisions. If the initial reports of such flow in high-energy p+p collisions are confirmed at higher energies, this raises important issues about the nature of flow, and the nature of the initial self-interacting state, itself. In addition, there are broader impacts to society of this proposal in the areas of education, technology and computing."
0.033591,"The aim of this project is to advance the understanding of the inner workings of the atom. Specifically, this project investigates how all the components that make up the beryllium atom, the fourth element on the periodic table, come together to give beryllium its atomic and nuclear properties. Our knowledge of atomic systems is driven by both experimental and theoretical results. The lighter elements (hydrogen, helium, and lithium) have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Because beryllium has more subatomic particles compared to the three lighter elements, it is more complex and difficult to model. As the computations involved in modeling this atom grow more complex, it becomes essential to provide experimental results to both check those calculations and determine which theoretical models correctly describe this multi-electron system. The most precise experimental measurements currently available for beryllium are up to 10,000 times less precise than those for the three lighter elements. This project will greatly improve upon these experimental measurements in order to validate fundamental atomic and nuclear theories as well as provide information about the nuclear and electronic structure of the atom. Understanding beryllium is an important stepping stone to developing a multi-electron theory that successfully describes larger and heavier atoms, which make up the bulk of the periodic table of the elements and are essential components of the materials that we live and work with every day.<br/><br/>High precision spectroscopy will be performed on the neutral beryllium isotope chain to significantly improve the experimental accuracy of several key energy levels. The results will delineate various theoretical models, test quantum electrodynamics, and help determine the nuclear charge radius of beryllium. Spectroscopy will be performed on both singlet states (2s2p, 2s3d, and 2snp Rydberg states) and triplet states (2s2p, 2s3s, 2s4s, and 2snp Rydberg states) as well as the ionization threshold. An oven operating at 1200 degrees Celsius will produce a beam of neutral atomic beryllium. Transverse spectroscopy will be performed on this atomic beam using a variety of laser sources including a frequency quadrupled Ti-Sapphire laser and external cavity diode lasers. Photon energy calibration is provided by a calibrated ultra low expansion cavity and the atom-light interaction is detected by absorption, fluorescence, or ion detection depending on the state being studied."
0.07,"Many important reactions in nuclear physics cannot be measured with currently available experimental techniques. For example, the reaction probability of the process in which two protons fuse to form a Deuteron (a bound state of a neutron and a proton) is an important process in the sun, but cannot be measured experimentally; only theoretical calculations can provide this rate. In the absence of guidance from experiment, it becomes important to quantify theoretical uncertainties. This project will address these issues for specific reactions. Analytical and numerical calculations will be used to determine reaction rates for astrophysically-relevant reaction rates, and new parametrizations of the internuclear interaction will be provided. Specifically, the PI and his students will use interactions that have been constructed using a theoretical tool known as effective field theory. This tool is an expansion that can be systematically improved by introducing, in a controlled manner, additional parameters to increase the accuracy of the interaction model. Numerical techniques will be used to determine the intrinsic error of this approach, parametrize the interaction, and calculate the reaction rates for selected processes. A quantification of resulting uncertainties will improve our understanding of the internuclear interaction. This project will also provide an excellent training ground for graduate and undergraduate students and will contribute to a needed workforce in those technologies that rely on nuclear physics, which are relevant to security, energy and the health care sector. Graduate students will become familiarized with numerical methods that can be useful when working in industry.<br/><br/>This project follows a two-prong strategy that aims at improving our understanding of weak processes using effective field theory. Firstly, a number of weak processes in few-nucleon systems will be calculated within the unified framework of the so-called pionless effective field theory. Specifically, the well-measured decay half-life time of tritium will be treated and used to fix a parameter that within this framework is required for a high-accuracy of proton-proton fusion and weak proton capture on Helium-3. The second prong will focus on understanding the intrinsic error of Hamiltonians and associated electroweak currents generated with the so-called pionfull effective field theory. The PI will use novel numerical optimization/fitting techniques to establish an ordering scheme for the chiral potential and the associated electroweak currents that reflects the intrinsic error of the Hamiltonian order-by-order. Together with his collaborators, the PI will then use these results to calculate observables such as half-life times or total decay rates to new accuracy and with correct error estimates. The resulting interactions and currents will be made available to the nuclear theory community."
0.180318,"String theory, as a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, encompasses both quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of general relativity. A remaining challenge is the identification of the appropriate set of background conditions relevant to the formation of our universe. Compactifying the eleven-dimensional M-theory/supergravity can lead to a very large number of four dimensional vacua. It is therefore necessary to understand the extra, compact dimensions and discover the links between the properties of these spaces and the physics we observe in our universe. <br/><br/>This research addresses two important aspects of string compactifications. A primary focus is the determination of how, in the context of global flux compactifications, string vacua exhibiting Standard Model like spectra exist. This study will also apply constraints from cosmology, such as the cosmic microwave background, to put restrictions on the inflationary type potentials obtained from string theory. In addition, questions regarding the details of the geometry, such as mirror symmetry, will be addressed. A second approach will be made in studying various features of AdS4/CFT3 aimed at improving our understanding of the four dimensional string landscape, as well as three dimensional condensed matter systems. The projects , taken together, are very timely since, during the course of the next few years, data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will be improving our understanding of physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, more accurate observations of the cosmic microwave background using the European Space Agency PLANCK satellite will provide even tighter constraints on the possible inflationary scenarios arising in string theory. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Results from the proposed work will be of interest to several sectors of the mathematics and physics communities. Furthermore the proposed activities will foster collaborations and intellectual exchange within the UNH physics and mathematics community and amongst regional, national and international collaborating scientists. In addition the research program will be coupled with a strong outreach program taking the frontiers of particle physics into local high schools. This will capitalize on the existing infrastructure within the Theorynet, an NSF sponsored program in the greater Boston area, as well as at UNH, for interactions with high school teachers and students. Such interactions will include seminars and informal question-answer sessions with both teachers and students during presentations by the PI at local high schools, as well as visits by high schools to UNH to learn about research in theoretical particle physics."

Though historically pursued primarily<br/>for electricity production from nuclear sources in space applications, it has the potential to be used<br/>terrestrially for waste heat, solar, or nuclear energy conversion. To meet this objective, however,<br/>TEC must be enhanced to operate more efficiently at lower temperatures than historically possible.<br/>Microplasma thermionic energy conversion occurs when a microplasma (ionized gas) is ignited<br/>between a thermionic diode with an electrode spacing ~1-20 micrometers. This mode of operation<br/>could enable operation in inert gases, at near atmospheric pressures, and at lower temperatures - all<br/>necessary features for practical terrestrial application. Understanding of the fundamental interaction<br/>between thermionic emission and microplasmas will be advanced by this research in order to pave<br/>the way for microplasma-TEC devices. First principles theory and simulations will be used to reveal<br/>the inter-dependence between a microplasma and thermionic emission, and experiments will be<br/>conducted to confirm the enhancement of thermionic emission by a microplasma necessary to realize<br/>improved energy conversion efficiency. Carbon-based electrodes, including diamond and carbon<br/>nanotubes, will be synthesized using a microplasma jet processing technique and used as electrodes<br/>in microplasma-TEC experiments. In addition to the efficacy of microplasma-TEC being established<br/>by this research, fundamental studies will also advance the basic understanding of plasma/electrode<br/>coupling, where there are persistent questions that affect a wide variety of technologies from highintensity<br/>discharge lamps to arc-based materials deposition.<br/><br/>Direct thermal-to-electrical energy conversion can be used to convert solar, nuclear, and waste heat<br/>to electricity, and energy conversion technologies will play an important role in creating a more<br/>energy efficient and independent nation.

0.4,"Accelerators are used in many applications, from studies of the fundamental components of matter to medical and industrial applications. The advancement of accelerator technology relies on a deep and detailed understanding of the behavior of the particle beam inside the accelerator. Sophisticated simulation codes have been developed to model the particle beams in the accelerator in order to aid in understanding particle beam behavior in current accelerators, and in the design of future accelerators. To produce accurate results, the simulations require an initial description of the beam that is beyond what has yet been experimentally measured. The deficit of knowledge in this area places a fundamental limitation on progress toward understanding the beam behavior in accelerators, particularly in high power accelerators. The main difficulty in acquiring this information is the extensive time associated with performing the experimental measurement, which renders it impractical or impossible for operational accelerators, and the necessity for developing the novel diagnostics device capable of performing the full multi-parameter measurement. In this project, the University of Tennessee will make use of the Integrated Test Stand Facility (ITSF) at the Spallation Neutron Source accelerator in order to perform the first comprehensive measurement of the initial beam properties. The ITSF is a duplicate of the first piece of the SNS accelerator, and therefore provides a realistic platform for this measurement but without the time limitations associated with operational accelerators. This project will fund one postdoc, one graduate student, and a few undergraduate students from the University of Tennessee to design and implement the necessary equipment on the ITSF to perform the measurement, under guidance from staff at UT and at SNS. The project will enable these young scientists to gain hands-on experience in hardware design and data analysis, while also making an important scientific contribution. Almost all accelerators, from high-energy particle physics machines to future accelerators for transmutation of nuclear waste and energy production, will benefit from the results of this work.<br/><br/>For any linear accelerator, the quality of the beam in the front end limits what can be achieved downstream; a poor quality beam early on results in unwanted emittance growth and beam halo. One of the holy grails of accelerator physics is quantitative modeling of the onset and evolution of beam halo and it?s translation into beam loss during acceleration. Unfortunately, there is a recurring failure of state-of-the art simulation codes to successfully benchmark anything beyond RMS quantities of the beam. Since it is the extended beam tails that cause beam loss in an accelerator, this is a performance-limiting issue. The consensus in the community is that the problem is not a failure of the codes, but rather a deficit in knowledge of the initial beam distribution. To date, there has never been a full 6D measurement of the beam phase space exiting the front-end radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ). The thrust of the work is a modest expansion of the diagnostics to enable the first full 6D measurements of the beam phase space, and small modifications to allow subsequent measurements of the downstream evolution of beam. A final goal is to optimize the diagnostics schemes in operational accelerators to improve the ability to reconstruct initial beam phase space distributions. The extended ITFS will serve as a community-wide resource for understanding halo formation and improving measurement and modeling techniques; interested colleagues will be given the data and invited to perform their own experiments."
0.162,"This project is jointly funded by the LIGO Research Program (Physics Division) and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). This is an exciting time for the maturing field of gravitational-wave physics. Construction of Advanced LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory), an overhaul of the Initial LIGO interferometers, is now complete and the first couple months of data have been collected. The advanced detectors made last year the first direct detection of gravitational waves, a momentous event that will transform our understanding of the universe and marks the beginning of a new field of gravitational wave astronomy. Predicted by Einstein nearly 100 years ago, gravitational waves are distortions of space-time created by the movements of massive astrophysical objects such as exploding stars and coalescing black holes or neutron stars. The effect of gravitational waves on space-time is minuscule, however, and necessitates the design and construction of detectors that push the limits of precision measurement techniques. This award supports research to improve the Advanced LIGO sensitivity at low frequencies and increase the amount of time the detector is collecting science quality data. In addition, this program will serve as an invaluable training ground for undergraduate and graduate students who will develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines and prepare them to fill positions in academia and industry. The group is strongly committed to sharing the excitement of the field with the public through outreach at all levels, reaching out in particular to the communities in Mississippi.<br/><br/>Gravitational waves can be detected by using laser light to measure infinitesimal changes in the distance between mirrors located two-and-a-half miles (4 km) away from one another. The mirrors are suspended as pendulums to isolate them from all vibrations other than the gravitational wave. The Advanced LIGO detectors have achieved a sensitivity to changes in the distance between the mirrors of better than one-ten-thousandth the diameter of a proton. There nonetheless remain many challenges to further improve the interferometers in order to increase the rate of gravitational wave detections and expand the spectrum of astrophysical objects that can be observed. One such challenge arises from the design of the commercial seismometers that are used to provide active vibration isolation of the mirrors. The seismometers cannot distinguish between horizontal acceleration of the ground and tilt of the ground. This award supports the development of a high precision tilt-free seismometer to improve the Advanced LIGO seismic isolation. The project includes deriving updated requirements for a tilt-free seismometer based on data from the observatories, designing and modeling the instrument, constructing and measuring the performance of the tilt-free seismometer and conducting a theoretical and experimental noise analysis of the system."
0.180183,"Ordinary optical materials (like eyeglasses) are manufactured to be highly uniform in their optical properties--irregularities are taken to be a sign of inferior quality. By precisely controlling the irregularites, however, and making them conform to a particular pattern, one can create intriguing and potentially useful effects that go beyond what is normal in uniform systems. This project will explore some such effects which may mimic the behavior of graphene--a material that has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years because of its potential application in future microelectronics manufacturing. This analog of graphene is easier to work with than real graphene, allowing more rapid progress in exploring the true limits of this fascinating material. The experimental techniques that will be used in this research are straightforward enough for active participation of undergraduate and masters-level graduate students, yet the research activities will expose students to a broad range of phenomena in a cutting-edge field of interdisciplinary science. In fact, throughout the project, a major emphasis will be placed on mentoring students, particularly those from the ethnically diverse San Francisco Bay Area population. <br/><br/>Carbon-based graphene has been highly touted and tested as an extraordinary material for many applications, apart from elucidating fundamental physics phenomena. Recently, there is a surge of interest in creating ""artificial"" graphene systems not only for electrons, but also for atoms, photons, and other quasiparticles such as polaritons. This is simply because that artificial graphene can provide a tunable system to explore physical phenomena difficult or impossible to achieve in natural graphene. In this project, a simple optical induction technique will be used to create 2D honey-comb (graphene-like) lattices as well as other nonconventional lattice structures. More importantly, these photonic structures will be employed as a workbench for investigation some fundamental issues including surface states, vortices and equivalent spin effects and magnetic effects of light in graphene-like lattices. Although performed in a simple optical setting of reconfigurable photonic structures, much of the proposed work will have direct impacts on other areas of sciences, ranging from condensed matter physics to atomic physics such as Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in periodic potentials. For instance, the electronic edge states were known for decades, but such fundamental phenomena have recently attracted growing interest in optics that has led to the successful demonstration of photonic topological insulators. Indeed, there is much potential to use optical systems as photonic simulators for studying complex classical and quantum phenomena."
0.269025,"This research program is about quantum field theory, string theory and quantum gravity, greatly strengthening the thoretical understanding of our physical universe. One focus is on finding new general properties of strongly interacting quantum field theories, new exact results in supersymmetric (relating bosonic and fermionic elementary particles)quantum field theories, and new insights into the maximally superconformal (2,0) theory in six dimensions. (Conformal invariance is a generalization of scale invariance that only requires that the angles between corresponding curves do not change.) Another is on discovering new concrete examples and implications for non-perturbative particle interactions of the gauge/gravity correspondence, and researching the emergence of bulk locality in Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) space. Lastly, it will attempt to formulate the exact theory of quantum gravity in other backgrounds, such as an expanding de Sitter universe. Major progress has been made in discovering quantities that can be calculated exactly in supersymmetric theories, and much remains to be explored. The keys are finding new kinds of backgrounds in which supersymmetry is preserved, and then applying the technique of localization to obtain an exact reduction of the path integral to a finite dimensional integral. Such methods have given a window into the structure of the (2,0) theory, which puts its further elucidation within possible reach. The research involves the quantum entanglement entropies that give a monotonic function of scale in quantum field theories and probe the geometric structure of the emergent bulk in AdS/CFT. Nonlocal quantities such as the sphere partition function and entanglement entropy control renormalization group flows in odd dimensions implying that topological and propagating degrees of freedom are combined in a novel way. One direction of this project is to find examples of such behavior as well as new general constraints on renormalization group flows.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit : One of the most important open questions in theoretical quantum field theory is the determination of their dynamics at strong coupling. The new exact results for supersymmetric theories that are expected will lead to new insight into such systems. It also gives new checks of AdS/CFT and other dualities. Further explorations of quantities like the number of degrees of freedom that constrain renormalization group flows in three dimensions will lead to interesting new predictions for long distance behavior that may arise in condensed matter systems. Entanglement entropies have been playing an intriguing role in this context, and further exploring their general properties will lead to new advances. The discovery of a calculable description of the maximally superconformal theory in six dimensions will lead to new advances in understanding of supersymmetric theories in lower dimensions. Finding the general characterization, observables in arbitrary quantum states, of conformal field theory (CFT) operators that correspond to bulk will have significant implications for quantum gravity. It will be a step in understanding quantum gravity in general backgrounds, and would shed light on the black hole information paradox. New examples of AdS/CFT, and further understanding how the dualities involving the simplest conformal field theories fit into string theory will provide a window into the basic structure of the gauge/gravity correspondence. Advances in the problem of understanding the theory of quantum gravity in de Sitter space will shed light on this deep question relevant to our own expanding universe.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts : This research allows participation in the Boston area Theorynet program, delivering biannual talks to high school classrooms. This is a good way to impart the enthusiasm for discovering new fundamental laws of physics and the importance of scientific curiosity in general. The theoretical research in strongly interacting quantum field theories also has interdisciplinary connections to condensed matter physics, as well as quantum gravity and high energy theory. The subject of entanglement entropy makes a great special topics graduate course. It is relevant to information theory, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Lastly, through this research, finding new exact results in supersymmetric quantum field theories makes excellent manageable yet novel research projects for graduate students and postdocs."
0.664305,"CAREER: Ultracold molecular ions prepared via sympathetic cooling : a new frontier for quantum interactions and fundamental physics<br/>Eric R. Hudson, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports the development of techniques to open and explore a new frontier in physics: ultracold polar molecular ions. Recent work has shown that by spatially overlapping a cloud of ultracold calcium atoms with a molecular ion trap, it is now possible to produce samples of cooled polar molecular ions. It is expected that samples such as these will lead to significant technological and fundamental advancements, including the study and possible control of chemistry in the quantum regime, the implementation of a scalable quantum computer, new probes of quantum matter and charge transport, understanding the formation of interstellar clouds, and precision measurement of molecular structure for test of fundamental physics. Thus, the main research objective and intellectual merit of this project is to further optimize the methods of cold polar molecular production and begin developing the techniques necessary to enable the expected technological and fundamental advancements.<br/><br/>In concert with this research effort, this CAREER award also supports an effort to increase the broader impact of the work by partnering with the UCLA Graduate School of Education's Center X Science Project to develop a series of inquiry-based, hands-on experiments to help local K-12 schools meet the Science Content Standards for California Public Schools. Center X partners with well over 100 local schools, helping them to improve their curriculum and teaching strategies, but currently needs help in developing relevant, inquiry-based physics experiments. Since research shows that when coursework is coupled with hands-on experience, students learn more effectively, retain knowledge longer, and develop higher-order skills with the added benefit of reaching a diversity of students, this lack of curriculum must be addressed. To combat this deficiency, work under this CAREER award will develop a hands-on laboratory curriculum for high schools students closely tied to the research performed in our laboratory."
0.182172,"The purpose of this project is to continue the development of a fully relativistic computer code for electron and photon interactions with atoms and ions. The code has already been employed in a number of benchmark calculations to obtain highly accurate atomic data of critical importance for fundamental research and practical applications. In particular, the code is being used to model the physics and chemistry of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres. The computer code will be made available to the general public through an open-source license and a designated website. Undergraduate students will be trained in modern computational methods through developing and testing individual modules of the package. This includes running the code on massively parallel computing platforms provided through the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) resources supported by the National Science Foundation. <br/><br/>The B-spline R-matrix (BSR) approach has significant advantages over the well-known suite of R-matrix (close-coupling) codes that were developed over the past four decades and are currently used worldwide. Specifically, the numerical properties of a B-spline basis yield high computational accuracy and the ability to employ non-orthogonal sets of term-dependent orbitals allows for compact configuration expansions. After having completed the parallelization of the semi-relativistic version, this project will support the development of a parallel implementation of the fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb version. The BSR collision codes will also be interfaced with a new suite of general atomic structure codes, which use B-spline expansions directly."
0.25499,"Massive Stars, like Betelgeuse in the Constellation Orion, end their lives as a core-collapse supernova. These powerful explosions mark the birth of a neutron star and spread a wave of ejecta, including a wealth of newly-made chemical elements, into the galaxy. Many of the elements that make up ourselves and our planet were produced in past supernova explosions. The modern understanding of the supernova explosion highlights highly turbulent ejecta heated by neutrinos that are escaping from the newborn neutron star. This project will study these explosions and their ejecta with a focus on i) how the nuclear physics aspects that determine the structure of the newborn neutron star influences the supernova explosion, and ii) how the developing highly turbulent, neutrino-driven dynamics of the supernova influences the production of chemical elements by the explosion. These tasks will provide excellent training grounds for graduate students in theoretical nuclear physics and computational physics.<br/><br/>The investigators and their students will use the CHIMERA neutrino radiation hydrodynamic code to perform two and three dimensional simulations of the supernova explosions for a number of star masses. In order to investigate the impact of the nuclear physics of the neutron star on the explosion, models using a series of nuclear equations of state will be explored. This study will reveal the physical regimes where the nuclear equation of state has the most influence on the supernova explosions. In order to investigate the nucleosynthesis of core-collapse supernovae, the investigators will utilize post-processing analysis (via tracer particles and a large nuclear reaction network) to explore the full nucleosynthesis impact of a range of models. This will be abetted by additional simulations that include larger, more realistic nuclear reaction networks within the CHIMERA simulations. Together, these models are expected to provide the most realistic simulation to date of the elemental and isotopic production of core-collapse supernovae."
0.32,"A large body of evidence now indicates that about 80% of the matter in the universe is of a new type, known as dark matter. A variety of experimental and observational techniques from high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology have been brought to bear on the study of this new type of matter. But in order to correctly interpret the data from these many different experiments, it is necessary to develop a theoretical framework for understanding dark matter. The PI's work will focus on developing the connection between new theoretical dark matter models and data. The PI will explore how data from many different experiments can together be used to test non-standard models of dark matter, and how new models of dark matter can be used to explain the data. A focus will be on the study of isospin-violating dark matter, WIMPless dark matter, asymmetric dark matter, and on the use of neutrino detectors to search for dark matter. The Broader Impact of this proposal will be the communication of these and other exciting developments at the frontier of fundamental physics to the broader Hawaii community, particularly at the high school level. The PI's efforts will be focused on participation in the QuarkNet program."
0.2298,"This award provides support for seven students per year to participate in a summer research program in Biophysics at the University of Michigan. The site will provide incoming students with an interdisciplinary research experience at the intersection of chemistry, physics, mathematics and the life sciences. Since Biophysics is intellectually extremely diverse, the aim is not only to provide research experience in a subfield of the discipline, but also provide an overview of state-of the-art research in the field, and the experimental methods and techniques that are commonly used. Therefore, the research experience is constructed to have two components: 1) the students will be assigned to the labs that match their interest and that are run by experienced researchers to participate in innovative scientific exploration, 2) the REU students will be allowed (at their own choosing with the advice of their research mentor) to participate in hands-on exploration of biophysical methods and techniques (HEBMAT) that will introduce them to various modern experimental and computational research techniques. Thus, upon completion of the program the students will have gained exciting research experience and will have acquired a biophysical toolkit making them more successful and competitive in the scientific and academic environment. This core experience will be augmented by weekly research seminars and workshops, plus opportunities for social interactions, which will often be coordinated with other summer undergraduate research programs to broaden the students' integration into our scientific and professional communities. This award is funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Chemistry within NSF."
0.442247,"In this project the PI will elucidate two novel biological mechanisms for living systems to contend with particulate environments. Flying insects must avoid or negotiate droplets in rain and mist. Larger organisms use eyelashes to diver particle-laden flows from delicate organs such as the eyes. In parallel with the research efforts, the PI will use these familiar and highly visual topics to naturally guide an educational program to broaden the scope of biophysics past the traditional cellular level and increase its visibility to all audiences. The PI will study experimentally the interactions of mesoscale objects (mosquitoes and eyelashes) with particulates in a surrounding fluid medium. The following hypotheses based on preliminary work will be tested. (1) Insects survive collisions with raindrops by tumbling their bodies to reduce impact impact force. The universality and limits of this ability will be examined across a range of insect sizes. (2) Using high-speed video, the PI observes that mosquitoes are unable to stabilize their flight in fog. The failure of an otherwise robust system is surprising. The PI hypothesizes that gyroscopic signals from their halteres are overcome by signals created by inertial impact of fog drops and subsequent water accumulation. This hypothesis suggests a novel mechanism for the action of pesticides, and is of interest to his collaborators at the Navy Entomological Center. (3) Investigate how mosquitoes shed dew collected on their bodies using high frequency vibrational energy harvested from their wing flaps. The PI will conduct a parallel study on particle deposition on vertebrate surfaces, hypothesizing that mammalian and avian eyelashes divert incoming flows to reduce particle deposition onto the ocular surface. The PI will recruit undergraduates, high-school students and teachers from underrepresented groups. He will establish a photography internship at GT to increase the use of aesthetic and scientific photography in labs to facilitate scientific communication to the public. He will also teach ""Living with particles,"" a new lab course on biophysics of locomotion. With a 10th-grade teacher, he will develop ""Snakes on a Plane,"" one of a series of educational modules to teach Georgia Physical Standards. The PI will test and disseminate these modules by hosting students and teachers during ""Wet Week,"" a weeklong workshop at our institution."

0.042985,"It is known that Einstein's General Relativity (GR) is theory to describe the gravitational physics. The theory of GR has helped us to make many tremendous progresses in understanding the fundamental aspect of space and time. The theory has been successful in describing the physics of universe, as well as making predictions for various astrophysical phenomena. However it is also well-known that the theory of GR is incomplete. It loses its capability of making predictions in the extremely strong gravitational field, e.g. inside a black hole, or at the very early stage of universe near the big bang. One of the most fundamental open questions in physics is how to complete GR in order to predict physics in an extremely strong gravitational field. The complete theory of gravity that we are searching for is called ""Quantum Gravity"". The theory of Quantum Gravity should play a crucial role in describing the physics inside black hole, and helping us to understand the early universe near the big bang. Eventually Quantum Gravity will lead us to a revolutionary understanding of space and time. The PI's group will also train students in STEM areas of research.<br/><br/>This award support the development of a the theory of known as ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" (LQG). LQG is an approach toward Quantum Gravity featured with the background independence and non-perturbative quantization of spacetime structure. In developing the theory of LQG, the PI presented a promising new formulation of LQG with a cosmological constant. The new formulation defines finite spinfoam amplitudes of LQG. It also relates LQG to many other branches of physics and mathematics, in particular, it points out a concrete relation between LQG and String/M-Theory. The new formulation of LQG with a cosmological constant is going to be fully explored in this project, hopefully making progress towards some open issues in cosmology. The proposed work aims at (1) completing both the non-perturbative and perturbative formulation of the new model; (2) obtaining new insights and tools for LQG by exploring the relation to String/M-Theory and AdS/CFT; (3) extracting phenomenological predictions on the physics of cosmological constant. This project is expected to be an important step toward a complete formulation of LQG that could be empirically tested."
0.168103,"This award supports the renewal of the physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of California, Davis. Each year, the REU program will provide ten or eleven students from around the United States an opportunity to participate in a ten-week summer research program. REU students work closely with a faculty mentor on a ten-week research project in a variety of physics subfields. The projects span the subfields of astrophysics, biophysics, complex systems, condensed matter, nuclear and particle physics. Examples include developing new photomultipliers for dark matter searches, analyzing spectroscopic data to learn about the molecules present in distant planet-forming regions, designing new proteins with useful energy storage properties, and exploring strongly correlated materials through nuclear magnetic resonance. <br/><br/>In addition to their specific research project, the students learn from their interactions with faculty, graduate students, and other REU students, and from field trips showing physics-related work in diverse settings -- students will visit facilities such as the McClellan Nuclear Research Center, Lick Observatory, and the Advanced Light Source. Former UC Davis REU students now working in the San Francisco Bay Area will also describe their career paths to current participants. At the end of the program, each participant gives a formal research presentation and presents a written project report that can lead to a peer reviewed publication. Taken as a whole, the REU activities teach skills useful for further scientific endeavors, give students a broad perspective on possible future paths, and help them build a network of professional contacts. The program especially targets students from small colleges with limited research opportunities and those from groups underrepresented in physics, including women and students from certain minority groups."
0.082,"The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of avalanches in a plasma, a cloud of ionized gas, that is permeated by a magnetic field. Avalanches are sudden events that cause major changes over an extended region of a physical system. Although the concept is commonly associated with catastrophic ""snow avalanches"", the general phenomenon occurs widely in both natural and artificial systems. A typical driver and source of energy for an avalanche is a sharp change in one of the parameters that describes the underlying system. This project is a synergistic experimental and theoretical study of avalanches triggered by a steep slope in plasma temperature and density across a magnetic field. This is a situation widely encountered in natural plasmas, such as in magnetic field structures on the Sun and around the Earth, and has to be accounted for in any design of a magnetic fusion device. The project will involve a graduate student who will gain a unique perspective on modern experimental techniques and will also participate in theoretical and numerical modeling work.<br/><br/>To date, the majority of experimental information about avalanche transport in a magnetized plasma has been obtained in devices designed for fusion studies. However, due to the complexity of these devices, it has proven difficult to unravel the underlying physical mechanisms of the process. This project aims to significantly expand the experimental knowledge base by exploring the behavior of a well-defined plasma configuration that exhibits repeatable, controllable avalanche events. The data obtained in the experiments will provide quantitative information about the role of self-organized criticality dynamics, the formation and evolution of streamers, the effect of flows and flow shear, and the manifestation of nonlocal transport of both temperature and density. These topics are at the frontier of plasma science and are the subject of numerous ongoing theoretical and computational studies."
0.27,"Advances in the physics goal of understanding the universe at its most fundamental level have shown that matter is composed of a set of fundamental particles that combine to form other particles that group together to generate the structures that we recognize around us. For example, the nucleus of an atom is formed from a mixture of protons and neutrons. These protons and neutrons are made from constituents, called quarks and gluons, which give substructure to these particles. The goal of this project is to determine aspects of the structure of the proton and neutron, and how this structure is affected when placed in the nucleus. The experiments focus on how the quarks are distributed in space and in momentum. An on-going puzzle is whether the proton size is not the same when measured with atomic hydrogen and its counterpart, muonic-hydrogen, where the electron in the hydrogen atom has been replaced by its heavier cousin, the muon. The project includes measurement of electron and muon scattering from protons to provide an independent measurement of the proton radius. In addition to the direct scientific goals of the project, the experiments provide students and young scientists experience and training in working in the international collaborations of modern scientific experiments, with state of the art technology.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this proposal is study the structure of the nucleon. The ongoing Fermilab SEAQUEST experiment uses Drell-Yan cross sections to determine the ratio of anti-d to anti-u quarks in the nucleon as a function of quark momentum, to study transverse momentum distributions, to investigate the EMC effect, to study quark energy loss in cold nuclear matter, and to investigate the possible existence of dark photons in a parameter region of higher mass but lower coupling constant to ordinary matter. The Fermilab MINERvA experiment provides a complementary view of nucleon and nuclear structure by scattering few GeV neutrinos from protons and from nuclei. At Jefferson Lab, experiments on tritium targets will be run in 2017. The MARATHON experiment, through a comparison of deep inelastic scattering of electrons on 3H to 3He, provides information on the ratio of the proton and neutron F2 structure functions at high x, testing decades old perturbative quantum chromodynamics model calculations. The preliminary phases of creating a new experiment to elastically scatter muons and electrons from the proton, the MUSE experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, are in progress, with the goal of measuring the distribution of charge in the proton."

The award will allow the NSCL to continue its nationally and internationally prominent leadership role in these areas by operating as the nation's premier user facility dedicated to the production and study of rare (short-lived) isotopes.<br/><br/>The development of new instrumentation along with new techniques and new beam capabilities form a potent combination allowing extraordinary discovery potential to be realized. The proposed physics program builds upon these strengths while creating new assets that will sustain and enhance NSCL's scientific standing. MSU was recently selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) for the next generation national Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). These opportunities have strong overlap with the stated scientific goals of the 2007 NSAC Long Range Plan, and form a coherent trajectory towards the implementation of FRIB. <br/><br/>The NSCL is a university-based national user facility serving a user community of more than 700 registered users from the U.S. and abroad. The NSCL plays a prominent role in the education of the next generation of scientists through a close synergy of classroom education and hands-on laboratory research throughout the entire graduate career.

0.49,"This CAREER award will enable tests of fundamental physics through precise measurements of the properties of trapped charged particles. Many atoms, molecules, and sub-atomic particles have attributes that are of interest but impractical to measure using a particle in isolation. Often the isolated particle lacks suitable means for cooling or for preparing or detecting its quantum state. Techniques developed for trapped-ion quantum information processing have recently enabled the transfer of the practical tasks to a co-trapped atomic ion, using the interaction between two charged particles as an information bus and opening for investigation a wide range of charged particles. Experiments enabled by this award will focus on diatomic molecular ions, including the cooling of molecular rotation, the preparation of known internal states, and the precise determination of the energy differences between states. These measurements will be applied to searches for time-variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio. While no known laws of physics allow for a change in this ratio, variation arises naturally in many theories seeking to merge quantum mechanics with gravity.<br/><br/>This work will integrate research and education through the mentoring of undergraduates at the forefront of research while developing an innovative physics curriculum at a liberal arts college. Undergraduate students will be introduced to active questions in the field and the experimental techniques being used to answer them. Many skills in experimental physics are transferable to a wide array of future endeavors. In addition, this award will allow for the development, implementation, and dissemination of a revised physics curriculum at Amherst College."
0.54,"Atoms in highly-excited so-called Rydberg states are true giants of the atomic world with their outer electrons traveling relatively slowly in orbits with diameters that can approach a fraction of a millimeter. As for any traveler in distant lands, Rydberg electrons are both isolated and vulnerable and their motions can be readily controlled using a carefully-tailored sequence of 'kicks' imparted by a series of electric field pulses. Under the influence of such kicks the Rydberg electron can display a wide variety of behaviors including chaos.This will be exploited to explore the potential of emerging new paradigms for information processing based on the complex behavior of chaotic systems including the use of Rydberg atoms as logic gates, in pattern recognition, and in data mining. The behavior of pairs of Rydberg atoms positioned close to each other such that they interact very strongly will be examined to explore energy interchange and to search for novel long-lived molecular Rydberg states containing two excited electrons. Attempts will also be made to create long-lived atoms containing two excited electrons that are each placed in large orbits and whose motions are stabilized by their mutual interactions and mirror that of a classical planetary system. Measurements will be undertaken in which radio-frequency fields will be employed to drive the motion of the Rydberg electron to probe the behavior of atoms in ground or low-lying excited states when acted upon by ultra-short ultra-intense laser pulses -- in essence replacing the extreme lasers by extreme atoms. These studies with Rydberg atoms will provide a valuable bridge between the nanoscale world of quantum physics and the macroscopic world of Newtonian mechanics.<br/><br/>The present research program will contribute to the training of the scientific workforce by providing students a firm foundation in many areas of physics together with a diverse array of experimental skills in many technologically relevant areas such as high-vacuum technology, lasers, high speed electronics, computerized data acquisition and control, and computer modeling. The experiments on strongly-interacting Rydberg systems will provide valuable new insights into the mesoscopic world and mesoscopic systems such as quantum dots and quantum wells that play a prominent role in exploratory concepts and technologies related to quantum information processing and quantum computing. The work will also provide new information on physics in the ultra-fast ultra-intense regime and speak to the engineering of low-lying atomic (and molecular) states by using attosecond laser pulses to control their properties and behavior, including their chemical reactions. Studies of the response of Rydberg atoms to series of electric field pulses promise new insights into classical chaos and the mathematical tools used to describe it, and furnish a novel laboratory in which to test new paradigms for information processing and data manipulation based on the characteristics of chaotic systems. Rydberg atoms lie at the interface between the quantum and classical worlds and provide a critical bridge between both."
1.251,"Neutrino oscillations not only demonstrate that neutrinos have mass but also imply the existence of new symmetries beyond the Standard Model. Natural conjectures suggest that deeper understanding of neutrinos may provide a glimpse onto phenomena at a Planck-scale energy level, could broaden our knowledge of the fundamental forces, could shed light onto the initial creation of leptons and baryons, and can help to improve our understanding of the early evolution of the Universe. These observations motivate further studies of the properties of neutrinos including investigating if they are Majorana- or Dirac-type. Majorana-type neutrinos lead to a neutrinoless double beta decay -- the second-order weak nuclear process for which an initial state nucleus with atomic weight and number (A, Z) is transformed into a nucleus with (A, Z + 2) with the emission of only two electrons. The two electrons in the final state carry a total energy equal to the energy of the nuclear transition. This seemingly simple principle provides the main observable for detecting neutrinoless double beta decay and poses an experimental challenge in searches for such transitions.<br/><br/>This award will provide funding to continue this group's participation in the NEMO-3 data analysis and in the construction of the first SuperNEMO module (the 'Demonstrator'). The NEMO-3 data, collected at the Modane Underground Laboratory under the French-Italian Alps between 2003 and 2011, will be fully analyzed over the next couple of years. For SuperNEMO, the next three years will be a critical period for completing and commissioning the Demonstrator. This group has two new important commitments: to provide the high voltage system for all Demonstrator photomultipliers, and to coordinate the radio-purification of 82-Selenium and production of isotopic foils.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Proving or disproving that neutrinos are Majorana-type may shed light onto the early stages of the evolution of the Universe. This experiment will advance knowledge about some of the rarest phenomena in Nature. On the technical side, the group is developing a unique low background counting technique which may be applied outside of physics and be of general benefit to society. They plan to build on the UT campus an exhibit gallery illustrating the discovery, the underlying physics, and applications of natural radioactivity, cosmic rays, and related subatomic phenomena. It would 'tell a story' that would educate, entertain, fascinate to seek further information, and perhaps steer students or general audience towards the sciences."
0.24,"Allowing for phenomena such as the ability of a particle to be in two places at the same time, quantum mechanics is extremely weird. In the past few decades, physicists have been trying to harness this weirdness to build new technologies such as extremely fast quantum computers, provably secure quantum communication devices, and exotic quantum materials. Most quantum systems feature short-range interactions, that is, interactions between adjacent particles only. On the other hand, many recently engineered AMO (atomic, molecular, and optical) systems, such as ultracold atomic ions, polar molecules, and highly excited neutral atoms, feature long-range interactions, that is direct interactions extending far beyond adjacent particles. These long-range interacting AMO systems are arguably the most controllable, tunable, and strongly interacting quantum systems. Precise control over them has recently opened a new paradigm for quantum computing, quantum communication, and engineering of new materials. The goal of this project is to advance the frontier of this new paradigm by exploring the - still largely unknown - potential of these systems. First, concepts from mathematical physics will be used to tackle the challenge of establishing and saturating new limits on how rapidly one can send information across these long-range interacting quantum systems, with applications to quantum communication and quantum computing. Second, methods from quantum information theory will be used to study how long-range interactions can speed up the generation of some of the most complex and exotic quantum states, states that are as different from classical states as possible. The ability to prepare these exotic quantum states will significantly enhance the precision of quantum-based metrology, including clocks, magnetometry, and gravimetry. In synergy with parallel developments in condensed matter physics, the ability to prepare these exotic states may also lead to the design of materials with unprecedented electromagnetic, thermal, or structural properties. All of the above-mentioned groundbreaking quantum-enabled technologies are bound to improve national security and increase economic competitiveness of the United States.<br/><br/>Postdocs and graduate students will be advised and trained and undergraduates will be involved in this research during the summers. New opportunities to increase public scientific literacy by giving talks to non-science audiences will be explored. Being highly interdisciplinary, this work will also naturally foster synergistic interdisciplinary interactions between AMO physicists, condensed matter physicists, computer scientists, and mathematicians. <br/><br/>AMO (atomic, molecular, and optical) systems with long-range interactions, such as Rydberg atoms and polar molecules, are arguably the most controllable, tunable, and strongly interacting quantum systems. Precise control over them has recently opened a new paradigm for quantum computing and communication, entanglement generation, and engineering of new phases of matter. This work will advance the frontier of this new paradigm by exploring the - still largely unknown - potential of these systems, which are often evolving in time far out of equilibrium. First, concepts from mathematical physics, such as Lieb-Robinson bounds, will be employed to tackle the challenge of establishing and saturating new limits on how fast information can propagate in a long-range interacting quantum system. Second, the quantum-information concept of tensor networks will be used to study how long-range interactions can speed up the generation of complex entanglement patterns in quantum systems. In addition to proving mathematical statements, the generated results will be used to engineer experimentally accessible systems to break the limits imposed by short-range interactions and to saturate the new limits that may hold in the presence of long-range interactions. These newly developed entanglement generation protocols will be used to enable the preparation, in AMO labs, of long-range entangled states, such as the fractional quantum Hall state, with applications to fault-tolerant topological quantum computing.<br/><br/>The proposed new Lieb-Robinson bounds on how fast one can transmit quantum information directly advance and define the frontier in various Lieb-Robinson-based fields ranging from quantum state transfer and quantum communication to the study of correlations in gapped ground states. Through the understanding of the structure and time evolution of entanglement in strongly-correlated long-range interacting quantum systems, this work will play a crucial role in harnessing entanglement for metrology, quantum computing, and quantum communication. The proposed use of quantum information science and long-range interacting AMO systems to advance the frontier in both fields will have a particularly transformative impact in synergy with parallel developments to interpret the new long-range-interacting phenomena in the context of condensed matter theory. In particular, this synergy will advance the frontier in understanding and classifying many-body quantum phases and quantum dynamics, which may in turn lead to the design of materials with unprecedented electromagnetic, thermal, or structural properties.

It is known from insects as diverse as honeybees, beetles and butterflies that animals have evolved diverse strategies to perceive and utilize electromagnetic waves. Organs evolved for perceiving or controlling electromagnetic waves often surpass similar man-made devices in both sophistication and efficiency. To date, most of the focus in this area of research has been on the abilities of insects to perceive shorter wavelengths of light; much less is known about how animals respond to longer wavelengths, in part because the tools to investigate this end of the spectrum have only recently become commonly available. In this research, physicists and biologists will collaborate in studying a few model systems, including the antennae of moths and specialized wing scales of butterflies, to understand how insects can perceive and utilize infrared light. Understanding and harnessing natural design concepts through ""biomimicry"" will deepen our knowledge of complex biological systems and inspire ideas for creating new technologies. The research will provide training opportunities in nanotechnology for graduate students in biology and physics.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project are to understand the physical mechanisms underlying the ability of insects to perceive and respond to infrared light, and to obtain engineering insights that can be used to create novel infrared materials, devices and systems. Infrared signals may play a critical and underappreciated role in a wide variety of insect behaviors. This project will provide a quantitative understanding of insects' abilities to sense and respond to broadband thermal radiation and narrowband fingerprint infrared radiation by analyzing two systems: (1) Scent pads and patches on the wings of butterfly species in the hyperdiverse tribe Eumaeini (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) that show extremely broadband, close-to-unity absorptivity/emissivity, and (2) Specialized sensilla on the antennae of different moth species that are able to capture infrared light with high wavelength-specificity and efficiency. The model insects will be studied using a multidisciplinary research platform. The infrared-sensing organs will be identified using single-sensillum electrophysiological recordings and behavioral bioassays with spectrally and temporally controlled infrared stimulation. The morphology of the infrared-sensing organs will be studied using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray micro-tomography. The optical properties of the sensilla will be studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, infrared microscopy, and finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic wave simulations. High-fidelity replicas of the infrared-sensing microstructures or their scaled models will be fabricated using nano- and micro-fabrication to systematically analyze how material properties, structures and arrangement of the sensilla affect the sensitivity and wavelength-specificity of infrared detection. Detailed studies of the mechanisms by which insects perceive and respond to infrared signals have not been carried out before, and a greater understanding of this phenomenon is likely to catalyze a new area of research for the scientific community. The project will expand our understanding of how natural selection can shape exquisitely adapted behaviors and structures."
0.398092,"The overarching goal of this project is to understand the biomechanical principles of proboscis self-assembly and to apply these principles to engineer fiber-based self- assembling microfluidic devices for manipulation of micro and nano droplets. The model system under investigation is the proboscis feeding tube of butterflies. This tube is assembled and hardened after emergence of the adult from the pupal encasement by joining dorsal and ventral galeae fibers and cuticle hardening. The mature proboscis is coiled but can be fully extended during the feeding process; the extension involves antiparallel sliding of the galeae fibers. The goals of the project are (i) to study the effect of saliva in creating capillary pressure that forces the two galeae together (the elasto-capillary effect) in live butterflies and a model system of fiber rails, (ii) to study saliva behavior during this process of proboscis assembly, using X-ray phase-contrast imaging, (iii) to provide full characterization of mechanical and wetting properties of the proboscis to evaluate the model parameters and assess the applicability of different self-assembling and hardening scenarios, and (iv) to develop a fiber-rail type microfluidic system that that relies on capillary action and would work on the principles of proboscis assembly/disassembly."
0.209997,"This project will concern the investigation of controlled reactions of directed incident electron beams with fundamental gaseous atoms and diatomic molecules. The laboratory at Cal State Fullerton will investigate details of the scattering process involving excitation of strong transitions in these targets specifically to look at how spin and orbital angular momentum is imparted by the incident directed electrons onto the target atoms/molecules. The targets chosen are the rare gases (neon, argon, krypton and xenon) and the molecules are hydrogen and nitrogen which have different electron-nuclear couplings. The research also aims to look at the ionization of the atomic targets. The thrust of this is to investigate the basic collision quantum physics that describes such processes. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this work is its involvement in state of the art research of many US undergraduate students at Cal State Fullerton in the laboratory. They then have a significantly increased chance to go onto PhD programs (mostly nationally, but in one case internationally). The research training also provided skills needed for working in industry or in other laboratories. These students get to do frontline research and benefit from collaborating with each other and faculty. It also provides collaborative research between Cal State Fullerton and several other theoretical and experimental collision physics programs, both nationally and internationally. The success of this group with data that tests collision models such as (most recently) the R-matrix B-spline was especially highlighted in the keynote talk at the last American Physical Society- Gaseous Electronics Conference at Salt Lake City. Such type of data is useful for industrial, plasma and astrophysical applications."
4.700001,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is to measure how quarks are distributed in nucleons and in particular how the magnetic moments of quarks are aligned compared with the nucleon?s overall magnetic moment. Measurements over the past decade have shown that the quarks contribute only about 1/3 of the total spin of the nucleon, which gives rise to prediction that a significant fraction comes from the orbital motion of the quarks and other sources. The goal of these experiments is to compare results on the quark distributions (and their orbital motion) with theoretical predictions from the so-called Standard Model of Particle Physics. Additional measurements to search for an electric dipole moment of the neutron, which would be a signal of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the properties of the elementary particles making up most of the visible matter in the universe, are also part of this project. These research efforts will contribute to the education of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates in a broad array of skills needed in the advanced high tech workforce.<br/><br/>The prevailing theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD, is a generalization of the highly successful QED, yet QCD is hard pressed to provide either quantitative or intuitive descriptions of nucleon structure. This project will focus on investigating key properties of the proton, targeting the poorly measured sea quarks and the unknown orbital motion of the quarks. The research will be performed at four experiments: SeaQuest at Fermilab, PHENIX at Brookhaven, and COMPASS-II and ATLAS at CERN. The strong force also played a role at the beginning of time. In the early stages of the big bang, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) existed for an instant, before the strong force confined the quarks into bound states. This fleeting state of matter has been recreated in the laboratory and found to possess extraordinary properties, such as a viscosity so low that it may be at its theoretical minimum. This grant enables continued study of the QGP?s properties using fully reconstructed jets at ATLAS and correlations in small collision systems at PHENIX. This award also supports a search for a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron, a CP-violating quantity. The nEDM experiment aims at a 100-fold improvement over the present upper limit of the EDM set by previous experiments."
0.204438,"Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of strong interactions between quarks and gluons that make up hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. This project will support theoretical and computational work to study the properties of this fundamental force at low temperatures, where quarks and gluons are bound together into hadrons, and high temperatures, where quarks and gluons interact weekly and form a quark-gluon plasma. A post-doctoral fellow will be mentored by the PI to work on several aspects of the proposal. Numerical computations will use high-performance computing systems, and results obtained as part of this project will be presented at international conferences in nuclear and particle physics.<br/><br/>QCD belongs to a class of (QCD-like) theories that exhibit a transition from confinement (hadronic matter) at low temperature or density to asymptotic freedom (quark matter) at high temperature or density. This project will study the fundamental features of QCD-like theories by studying them at finite physical volume using a new global observable. The project will also study confinement by exploring the properties of certain hadronic matter called hybrid/exotic mesons that are unique to QCD-like theories. In addition, this study will address related topics such as the existence of tetraquarks. The grand canonical ensemble for QCD-like theories at finite density will be rewritten as a sum over canonical ensembles to study two-dimensional QCD. The lessons learned there will be used to explore the feasibility for studying four-dimensional QCD at finite density."
0.411721,"Women now occupy approximately half of all seats in high school physics classrooms, but fewer than one in four undergraduate physics degrees are awarded to women. Worse still, only eight percent of full professors in physics faculty positions are women. Women physicists often do not receive the same level of support and mentoring throughout the various stages of their careers that men do, even if they do not experience overt discrimination. Many small but subtle acts of omission together with the isolation that comes from small numbers frequently add up to create a playing field that is far from level in terms of career advancement for women. The American Physical Society (APS) has run, for nine years, a series of influential workshops designed to improve communication, negotiation and leadership skills of female physicists. This award seeks to evolve these workshops into a sustainable model that will reach many more women.<br/><br/>This award will fund a continuation of the original workshops that also offers two new aspects: (1) training physicists as negotiation skills workshop facilitators who can conduct the Strategic Persuasion Seminars (SPS) at their institutions and at scientific conferences and (2) offering the traditional workshops on communication, negotiation and leadership skills at the larger APS divisional meetings. Information will be learned about what is of particular benefit to women in physics. Additionally the project will compare the impact of the workshops - delivered by the professional facilitators to the impact of the seminars - delivered by the physicists trained by the professional facilitators."
0.5244,"The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the largest neutrino detector in the world, instrumenting one cubic kilometer of ice near the geographic South Pole. IceCube completed construction in 2011 and includes a densely instrumented 'DeepCore' component in the center of the detector. The goal of IceCube is to detect neutrinos at Teraelectronvolt (TeV) - Petaelectronvolt (PeV) energies from astrophysical accelerators which are thought to be the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays. DeepCore extends IceCube's energy reach down to 10 GeV in order to study phenomena such as atmospheric neutrino oscillations and neutrinos from the annihilation of dark matter in the Galactic Center. <br/><br/>This award will fund the University of Alabama (UA) group that has developed algorithms for detecting tau neutrinos in the waveforms of individual IceCube sensors, lowering the energy threshold for tau detection in order to increase sensitivity to astrophysical taus. Initial analysis of the first year of full detector data has already revealed hints of diffuse neutrino flux in excess of the expected atmospheric background in the 100 TeV - 1 PeV energy range, and the algorithms developed at UA for tau neutrino detection are especially well suited to this energy range. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: UA has a strong commitment to secondary and undergraduate education. The PI has worked with undergraduates from various departments both in research and in developing outreach activities for local high schools. She also co-hosts a monthly gathering of female physics and engineering undergraduates and participates in public outreach activities that highlight IceCube's unique location and science goals."
0.07,"Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a successful theory of the strong interaction, the force that binds the nucleus. It can account for the types of quarks and the nuclear charges in the sub-structure of nuclear particles called hadrons. The greatest successes of QCD occur at high energies. At lower energies, the quarks clump together due to a phenomenon known as confinement. The simple picture is that of stationary quarks held by strings of nuclear fields. If a quark is extracted from a hadron, the string stretches and pulls a quark-antiquark pair from the vacuum leading to hadron production. However, nature is more complicated with dynamical quarks bound in hadrons. More experimental information is needed to explain the process of hadron formation. This project is a study of the formation of two hadrons, the omega and f1 mesons. These particles are produced in reactions where a high-energy electron is scattered from nuclei of deuterium, carbon, iron, and lead. The experiments are conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) in Newport News, VA. The Canisius College Medium Energy Nuclear Physics group, led by Dr. Michael Wood, is actively involved at TJNAF. The group will mine the data from an experiment that has already taken place for these mesons. In addition, the group is preparing for a follow-up experiment, which will extend the earlier research to higher beam energy. The undergraduate students involved in the project will gain valuable experience in mining large data sets and develop analysis skills.<br/><br/>The process of hadronization is characterized by two distinct time periods, the propagation time and the formation time. The Canisius College Medium Energy Nuclear Physics (CMENP) group seeks to understand the time frame for a free quark to couple with other quarks (propagation) and to stabilize its color field (formation). Nuclei of different sizes are used to extract these times. The width of the transverse momentum-squared (p2T) varies for nuclei with different sizes, with a greater broadening being associated with a longer propagation time. This project is part of a larger program at Jefferson Lab (JLab) to study long-lived hadrons forming in nuclei. To select the events from the E02-104 experiment at JLab, the data mining software, developed at Old Dominion University, efficiently skims the existing data files and copies the output over the network directly to the CMENP group offsite. The hadrons studied by our collaborators are pions, kaons, protons, and hyperons. The analysis by this group of the omega and f1 mesons and will investigate the mass dependence of hadronization. These results are essential for the interpretation of jet-quenching and proton-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC as well as neutrino interactions with nuclei at energies of a few GeV. This project will be extended to CLAS12. The PCAL software of CLAS12 is needed for the identification of a neutral pion, which exists in the decay of both the omega and f1 mesons. The CMENP group has taken the lead on PCAL software development."
0.155746,"This award supports research in the Humboldt State University Gravitational Physics Laboratory (HSU GPL). Precision experiments will test the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) of General Relativity and the gravitational Inverse-Square Law (ISL) at unprecedented levels. The WEP will be tested at the millimeter scale and the ISL will be probed over sub-millimeter distances with unmatched sensitivity down to approximately 25 microns. In recent years the study of the gravitational interaction at short (sub-millimeter) distance scales has gained much attention due in a large part to unification scenarios arising in string or M-theory that require more than three spatial dimensions, some of which could be macroscopic. Short-range tests of gravity and the WEP also investigate possible proposed mechanisms that endeavor to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, generally attributed to Dark Energy. Finally, such tests present the possibility to search for hypothetical new interactions due to exotic particles or other phenomena. Many scenarios concerning these effects predict a violation of the WEP or ISL at short distances. Since 1999, experimental limits have improved dramatically so that the ISL has proven valid over distances down to approximately 55 microns. A dedicated test of the WEP, however, has not been performed below the millimeter scale. The initial work described in this proposal will probe the WEP at the millimeter scale and below. This measurement will be accomplished with a parallel-plate torsion pendulum design that will provide an essentially null experiment and use multiple composition dipole combinations. Subsequently, a more difficult test of the gravitational ISL will be pursued by decreasing the pendulum/attractor mass separation to 100 microns.<br/><br/> Humboldt State University is in a predominantly rural area of Northern California and the GPL is the only dedicated physics research laboratory in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. This award ensures that our undergraduates gain valuable research skills necessary for continuation of studies or pursuit of a career in industry. Undergraduates will also be sent to perform research at the University of Washington through a collaboration formed with a gravity research group there. Alumni of the laboratory have secured graduate fellowships and industrial positions. This award greatly contributes to the valuable expansion of research at HSU in the STEM fields.<br/>Within the major program, software developed for data acquisition and analysis will be transferable to educational opportunities in the upper division classroom. This award also allows undergraduates to participate in valuable dissemination efforts through presentations at national and regional conferences as well as publication of research results. Finally, tests of gravity are of great interest to research in diverse fields ranging from astrophysics and cosmology to particle physics and precision measurement science."
0.105,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Naculich at Bowdoin College, an undergraduate institution located in Brunswick, Maine. This research is part of an on-going effort by the worldwide community of theoretical elementary particle physicists to develop mathematical models to explain the nature and behavior of the smallest constituents of matter (elementary particles). More specifically, this research aims at developing more efficient mathematical tools for calculating the predictions of existing models of quarks and gluons called ""gauge theories"". A second goal of this research is to explore links between gauge theories on the one hand, and theories (such as supergravity and string theory) that describe the behavior of gravitons, the particles responsible for the force of gravity, on the other. The insights gained through this research will be disseminated through journal publications, seminars, and conference proceedings. This research also integrally involves participation by undergraduates, and will therefore contribute to their education by providing hands-on training in research methods in theoretical physics, as well as exposure to quantum mechanics, group theory, and quantum field theory. Such involvement will encourage and prepare highly-talented students for graduate study and careers in scientific fields.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, this project focuses on both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of supersymmetric gauge theory and supergravity theory, as illuminated by their connection to string theory. In particular, this research will explore constraints among tree-level and loop-level gauge theory scattering amplitudes that are generic to gauge theory, independent of the matter content of the theory. These include both constraints that depend only on the gauge group, as well as Bern-Carrasco-Johansson type relations. The research will further investigate the structure of loop-level SU(N) gauge theory amplitudes that are subleading in the 1/N expansion, their infrared divergences, and potential iterative structures among these amplitudes. Finally, the project will study the structure of the amplitudes of supergravity, their infrared divergences, and potential relations between supergravity and supersymmetric Yang-Mills amplitudes at the loop level."
0.45,"In this project the PI will study the population and information dynamics that drive the infection of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans by the opportunistic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The worm offers advantages as a host model: its geometry is simple and it is easy to cultivate and image, while mechanism of infection and innate immune response are evolutionary conserved. The physical locomotion of bacteria within the host, their sensation of the host environment, and their adaptation and collective response will be imaged and quantified. Data will be analyzed and compiled into a theoretical framework, inspired by the physics of population dynamics and the statistical mechanics of ordering phenomena in disordered systems. This project will provide detailed description of within-host bacterial dynamics, believed to be key determinant in evolution of virulence and resistance to infection. While the project will focus on infection of C. elegans, emerging theoretical concepts are expected to be broadly applicable. Novel tools will be developed to permit long-term high-resolution imaging. The true interdisciplinary nature of the project and the general interest in pathogenesis bear the potential to attract a diverse cohort of students. The PI will develop a new course intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, which will discuss a spectrum of dynamical biological systems and develop the theoretical and practical aspects of modeling a complex biological system. The PI will establish a discussion group to accompany the project, composed of undergraduate students and public school teachers.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Physiological and Structural Systems in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems."

0.552866,"In this project the PI will combine techniques and expertise from physics and the life sciences to advance fundamental knowledge and providing a new technique for gene and drug delivery. The proposed approach is based on plasmon-mediated cell transfection. Cell transfection by femtosecond laser is an attractive alternative; however, this technique is currently limited to single-cell transfection. The PI will address the important goal of high-throughput, low-toxicity, and high-efficiency DNA delivery to cells by using plasmon devices that possess micrometer-sized points of extreme local field enhancements to porate cell membranes when irradiated by an ultrafast laser. By running parallel theoretical modeling of the field enhancement, fabrication of the substrates, and experimental analysis of the light-plasmon-cell interaction and DNA diffusion, the project will provide a powerful tool with broad applicability to transfection of numerous cell lines. The method proposed in this project will address challenging genetics questions and has the potential for transformative impact in the field of genetics and, more broadly, any biomedical research involving transfection. It will enable efficient, safe, and high-throughput introduction of genetic vectors into mammalian cells. This is the first step toward studying and optimizing the modification of genetic expression. Simultaneously, it will provide further insight in the light mediated transfection mechanisms. This work will also contribute to the education and the training of future multidisciplinary scientists through research-based education of undergraduate and graduate students. The work will be broadly disseminated to the general public."
0.119668,"Waves, such as water, sound and electromagnetic waves, are a prominent feature of physical systems. A revolutionary prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity is that accelerated bodies produce gravitational waves, analogous to the way electric charges produce electromagnetic waves. At present, gravitational waves have only been detected indirectly by the way they deplete energy from co-orbiting pulsars. A Laser Interferometric Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO) has been constructed that is expected to open up a new form of astronomy by direct detection of these waves. The most powerful source of gravitational waves is the inspiral and merger of two co-orbiting black holes. Computer simulations provide the theoretical details necessary for LIGO to tune in the gravitational signal and monitor the dynamics of the merger. Einstein's equations describe the production of gravitational waves but their complexity makes a purely analytic approach inadequate. This has necessitated the introduction of computational methods into general relativity. The project's goal is to develop advanced methods to simulate the production of gravitational waves from black holes.<br/><br/>The approach uses techniques for solving Einstein's equations which have been developed in collaboration with computational mathematicians, thoroughly calibrated on test problems and implemented as a community resource in the Einstein toolkit. The techniques will be further developed to measure the loss of energy and angular momentum carried off by gravitational waves, and other physical properties of binary black hole inspirals, such as the electromagnetic radiation counterpart. The approach utilizes characteristic evolution based upon the light cones on which the radiation propagates. Most computational work is based upon time evolution using the Cauchy initial value problem. The reformulation of the initial value problem for general relativity in terms of light cones by Bondi and by Penrose resulted in the first clear understanding of gravitational radiation. The global strategy proposed here combines Cauchy evolution in the interior region containing the black holes with characteristic evolution in the exterior region extending along the light cones to infinity. Characteristic evolution led to the first 3-dimensional code which could successfully locate, track, evolve and compute the waveform for a single distorted, spinning and moving black hole. However, in a binary problem, the focusing of the light cones leads to interior caustics which prevent a purely characteristic approach. On the other hand, present Cauchy codes require a finite artificial outer boundary which introduces inefficiency and errors in extracting the waveform. The proposed work integrates the complementary strengths of Cauchy and characteristic evolution to provide an accurate global treatment."
0.09148,"Our understanding of Nature at the smallest scales is encoded in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, which explains the properties of the elementary particles making up most of known matter in the Universe. Experiments such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland are now searching for subtle deviations from SM predictions that would indicate a new theory beyond the SM. This effort requires increasingly intricate and precise calculations in order to determine whether the predictions of the SM are indeed obeyed at the percent-level. The goal of this project is to produce precision simulation programs that can take full advantage of modern parallel computing systems in order to enable the successful pursuit of the program of discovery at the LHC. The graduate student working with the investigator on this project will be well-positioned for a future career at the cutting edge of scientific research and high-performance computing.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to produce parallel versions of several heavily-used numerical programs that incorporate higher-order corrections in the perturbative expansion of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interactions. Several representative codes written by the PI will be restructured to utilize a hybrid MPI+openMP parallelization scheme. The resulting programs will be scalable to take advantage of the ever-increasing number of nodes available on modern computing platforms. In addition to allowing otherwise intractable phenomenology to be performed, through these codes we will also gain insight into how future QCD calculations can be successfully structured to take full advantage of high-performance computing."
0.2,"This project will use theoretical methods to explore some of the fundamental questions at the interface of nuclear science with astrophysics and high-energy physics. These questions include where and how elements from deuterium to uranium are made in the Universe and the effect of the elementary particles called neutrinos on the production of elements and the origin of the asymmetry in the cosmic abundance of matter over antimatter in the observed Universe. This project will also examine nuclear reaction mechanisms at very low energies. This research contributes to the support of national scientific priorities in Nuclear Science, in particular to the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams under construction at the Michigan State University campus, a world-leading laboratory for the study of nuclear structure, reactions and astrophysics. The research efforts to be carried out here will also contribute to the training of next generation of scientists, enabling them to take part in a competitive workforce capable of performing in diverse settings. <br/><br/>The sheer number of neutrinos emitted from a cooling proto-neutron star following the collapse of a supernova core necessitates inclusion of neutrino-neutrino interactions in the description of the neutrino transport in supernovae. Symmetries of the collective modes of this many-neutrino system and their impact on the rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis in supernovae will be investigated. An unidentified emission line was recently seen in the X-ray spectrum of galaxy clusters that could be interpreted as a signal emerging from a decaying seven keV sterile neutrino, which mixes with the active ones. The investigator and his students will explore the effects of such states in reactor experiments and assess the likelihood of existence of such a state. They will explore also effects of neutrino magnetic interactions on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, together with various ways to exploit symmetries in understanding double beta decay nuclear matrix elements. Finally, the PI will re-examine the interaction potential between two nuclei in the light of the recent experience with the effective field theory, hitherto applied only to the nucleon-nucleon interactions."
0.09,"General relativity and quantum mechanics are the two major theories that govern fundamental physics, of space-time and of elementary particles. However, it is not known how they could be combined to a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Fascinating phenomena such as the very first stages of the big bang or the cores of black holes therefore remain out of the reach of our current understanding. This project investigates a wide range of systems in which both general relativity and quantum mechanics are relevant. The main interest is given by methods that allow one to derive physical implications by approximations, and to use the results to guide the developments of quantum gravity. Applications to the big bang and black holes often lead to conclusions that capture the interest of the general public. Related methods can also be used in systems not involving general relativity, where they may help to solve technical questions or to communicate results in a new way, supporting for instance the teaching of quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to introduce and evaluate new methods for a systematic analysis of physical implications of one set of candidate theories of quantum gravity, based on canonical quantization. Throughout physics, a powerful tool to derive potentially observable phenomena is given by effective theories which provide quantum corrections to the classical equations. Such systems can more easily be evaluated, analytically or numerically, than equations for quantum states and thus are more direct sources for the discovery of new phenomena. While standard techniques to derive effective equations do not apply to canonical quantum gravity, a general scheme applicable to canonical quantum theories exists (introduced by the PI) and is used in this project to address the main problems of quantum gravity. It provides the basis for a long-term program evaluating physical phenomena in the broad context of quantum gravity. Such a systematic derivation will make it possible to put effects found previously in simplified models on a firm footing, uncover new phenomena and provide reliable predictions. Results will be used to compare the theory with other candidates of quantum gravity, with the potential of a fruitful transfer of ideas and techniques between the approaches."
0.15,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Eric Sharpe at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The goal of this project is to further develop technical tools and methods used to help extract real-world physics from string theory, the leading contender to unify general relativity with quantum field theory, two of the most significant developments of twentieth-century physics. The price one pays for that unification is a prediction that the world has more than four spacetime dimensions. One standard proposal to resolve that discrepancy is via a `compactification' of string theory, in which the extra dimensions are rolled up on some small compact space. It can be shown that the geometry and topology of that small compact space determine low-energy four-dimensional physics. This project will further develop tools and techniques for understanding compactifications of string theory and the predictions of various compactifications for low-energy four-dimensional physics.<br/><br/>Technically, Professor Sharpe will study `gauged linear sigma models' (GLSM's), one of the most powerful tools used to study string compactifications. These tools have undergone a striking series of advances within the last few years. One part of that effort will revolve around extending the technology of supersymmetric localization in two-dimensional theories. As another part, Professor Sharpe will study dualities in nonabelian (2,2) and (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories in two dimensions. Professor Sharpe will also continue developing quantum sheaf cohomology, a mathematical generalization of ordinary quantum cohomology that determines stringy nonperturbative corrections to charged matter couplings in heterotic string compactifications, with a special focus on understanding quantum sheaf cohomology in Grassmannians and other objects built via nonabelian GLSM's, as a stepping-stone to computing quantum sheaf cohomology in compact Calabi-Yau manifolds."
0.3,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Carleton DeTar of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Utah. These activities are carried out in collaboration with scientists at several US universities and government laboratories. The research addresses fundamental questions in high energy and nuclear physics, and is directly related to major experimental programs in these fields. The principal goal of this research is to discover evidence for new fundamental physical processes and particles. This is done by comparing precise predictions of the presently agreed upon models with results of precise experiments. Secondary projects include a study of exotic states consisting of heavy quarks and a study of the properties of matter at extreme temperatures, such as may have occurred in the very early universe. The methods the PI will develop and the calculational products and software are used widely around the world for related studies. Algorithmic ideas developed in this project will almost certainly have applications in other computational fields. The supported activity promotes the development of young scientists.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, Professor DeTar is carrying out a broad research program in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of interacting quarks and gluons, in which he has been engaged for a number of years. He does this using numerical calculations on high performance computers. These numerical calculations are done on a grid of space-time points (lattice). During the last several years he has generated a library of gluon configuration ensembles with up, down, strange and charm quarks, using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action. They can be thought of as ""snapshots"" of the QCD vacuum. They are the basis for a wide variety of calculations of physical interest. These ensembles have significantly smaller lattice artifacts than those previously generated with the improved staggered (asqtad) action. Moreover, the PI has reached an important milestone by, for the first time, generating configurations in which the four lightest quarks are all included with masses at or very close to their physical values. For these reasons the HISQ ensembles are enabling major improvements in the calculation of a variety of physical quantities of importance in high energy physics. Under this project the PI will use them to extend studies of the leptonic decay constants of the pi, K, D, Ds, B and Bs mesons, the semileptonic form factors of D and B mesons, and the mixing of neutral B and Bs mesons with their antiparticles. These calculations will enable him to significantly improve the precision of the determinations of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements V_us, V_ub, V_cd, V_cs, and V_cb, as well as the masses of the up, down, strange, charm and bottom quarks. The calculations of the CKM matrix elements will enable more stringent tests of current theories of the fundamental interactions of physics, while the determination of related hadronic weak interaction matrix elements can shed light on theories that have been proposed to study physics that goes beyond our current theories. In addition, the PI will extend the study of QCD at high temperatures with the HISQ action that for the first time includes the effects of charm sea quarks. Finally, he will continue the effort to improve the precision of the determination of lattice spacings through use of the gradient flow."

Strikingly diverse topics in physics, ranging from the study of magnets to the dynamics of the strong force to the mysteries of quantum gravity, have been unified within a single framework: Conformal Field Theory (CFT). Roughly speaking, CFTs are quantum theories that combine special relativity with scale invariance, or invariance under the uniform stretching of space and time. The research funded by this award will use foundational principles to study CFTs and apply these discoveries to phenomenology, quantum gravity, and black hole physics.<br/><br/>By applying the bottom-up methodology of effective field theory (EFT)and the CFT Bootstrap to the study of holography, the PI will uncover the robust features of quantum gravity. He will expand on nascent programs characterizing general holographic dualities in terms of bulk EFT, and universal long-distance Anti de-Sitter (AdS) physics in terms of the large spin CFT bootstrap. He will adapt his expertise from the study of scattering amplitudes and the bootstrap to make previously intractable computations simple. The relationship between CFT and canonical gravity in AdS will be investigated to develop a deeper understanding of the emergence of bulk dynamics. New discoveries will also have significant payoffs for phenomenological models and for the broader understanding of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). The study of EFT in AdS has motivated new techniques for the solution of approximately conformal QFTs, and these methods will be deployed in order to study theories of relevance to phenomenology and condensed matter.<br/><br/>Specific goals are to understand the space of well-defined local quantum theories of gravity in AdS, to perform new non-perturbative studies of physically interesting CFTs, to study the robustness of black hole thermality and the CFT data that encode non-thermal corrections, and to build concrete connections between the holographic CFT and older descriptions of canonical quantum gravity, such as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, in order to understand the interior of black holes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: With help and input from students, the PI will develop his materials on the ""AdS/CFT from the Bottom-Up"" into<br/>extensive published course notes. The PI will also develop footage leftover from the documentary ""Particle Fever"" into short films for the education of high school students and the general public. This will provide the public and STEM teachers with<br/>pedagogical videos that convey the excitement and complexity of the scientific enterprise."
1.5,"SAVI: Student Research Network in the Physics of Living Systems (PoLS)<br/><br/>The goal of this project is for the PIs to join the Physics of Living Systems Student Research Network (PoLS SRN) to foster national and international interactions among scientists interested in research at the interpface of physics and biology. Harvard has a long tradition of supporting research and education at the interface of biology and physics with successful efforts originating from both physics and biology departments. One of the strengths of graduate student training at Harvard is the sheer breadth of Harvard's scientific community. Joining the PoLS network will leverage these diverse and often experimental experiences at Harvard at a national and international level to the benefit of other PoLS institutions. In return, Harvard efforts in the physics of living systems will benefit from complementary intellectual, educational and research activities at other PoLS institutions. The PIs also expect that the PoLS network will have synergistic effects at a purely local Harvard level, especially between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Physics Department, and the FAS Center for Systems Biology, which host the participating faculty. The future of life sciences lies is in the hand of young researchers, and increasingly in the hands of scientists whose training spans multiple disciplines including physics, engineering, and computer sciences. The PoLS network brings together universities in the US and abroad who share the vision that research and training partnerships across institutions and countries will harness previously unexploited complementary intellectual and educational strengths. The PIs share this view and propose that Harvard join the PoLS network. Harvard's participation will create new student-led collaborations and will strengthen existing ones, leading to new insights into general principles that help to explain the structure, behavior, and evolution of cells and organisms. The next generation of researchers working in the life sciences needs to be versed in both the methodologies of the physical sciences and the experimental practices of molecular biology. Bridging the cultures of physics and biology resembles (and benefits from) bridging other cultural differences, for example between institutions and countries. Traveling to another laboratory for a research internship or to a workshop exposes students to a different intellectual environment and to new problems and techniques. These encounters catalyze a profound change in students' appreciation for approaches outside their original expertise and motivate them to be more fluent in the language of a different field. The proposed trans-institutional and trans-national network will create a new community that fosters students creativity and encourages their curiosity and fearlessness in developing new approaches. For the same reasons students from underrepresented minority and disadvantaged backgrounds will particularly benefit from the proposed activities in the PoLS network. <br/><br/>This award is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering as well as by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division, the Molecular Biophysics Program in Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS."
2.454,"COUPP (The Chicagoland Observatory for Underground Particle Physics) employs room temperature bubble chambers to search for dark matter particle candidates. Following continuous 2011 operation of a chamber containing 4 kg of trifluoromethyl iodide (CF_3I) at the underground depth of SNOLAB at Sudbury, Canada, COUPP presently offers the best sensitivity to spin-dependent WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)-nucleus couplings from any dark matter search. Dramatic progress in acoustic discrimination against alpha particles and the abatement of backgrounds has recently been made. With these new developments, COUPP should also lead the field in sensitivity to spin-independent couplings, following the installation of an already-commissioned 60 kg chamber at SNOLAB.<br/><br/>The level of maturity reached by this technique has prompted this collaboration to initiate the conceptual design of a 500 kg module. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations indicate that this chamber will have the ability to perform an exhaustive exploration of the vast supersymmetric WIMP parameter space. The design is to be based on a modest extrapolation of the systems already developed and tested for the 60 kg chamber. This award provides support to complete the design and development of COUPP-500. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The effort described will generate substantial broader impacts in the areas of education and mentoring. COUPP has a long history of commitment to providing undergraduates with laboratory research opportunities, through UC, IUSB and FNAL programs, and to the mentoring and promotion of graduate students and postdocs."
0.27,"Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays. VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. This award supports scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology to carry out research with VERITAS. The group will study pulsars that emit very high energy gamma-rays to test models of particle acceleration and to look for evidence of the quantum-mechanical structure of spacetime. The group will work with undergraduates in research projects. They will also participate in the GIFT program, integrating a teacher in the group's research activities and developing classroom activities.<br/><br/>This award with support the Georgia Institute of Technology group as they begin the first comprehensive survey of pulsars in very high energy gamma-rays with a goal of finding more pulsars like the Crab that emit pulsed gamma-rays at energies above 100 GeV. They will perform a deep exposure of the Crab pulsar with VERITAS. This will extend spectral measurements into the TeV range in order to discriminate between model predictions of particle acceleration and to test Lorentz invariance. Photon detectors for future gamma-ray observatories will be characterized and simulation software will be developed."
0.18,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Daniel Boyanovsky at the Department of Physics, University of Pittsburgh. <br/><br/>Our understanding of the early and present Universe has been revolutionized by observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background and galaxies, supporting the main paradigm of inflationary cosmology: quantum-mechanical fluctuations of primordial origin seed the formation of galaxies. These observations, along with the discovery of the Higgs Boson and the experimental confirmation of the theory of strong and electroweak interactions, confirm the Standard Models of Cosmology and Particle Physics. Along with these discoveries new challenging aspects emerge: 95% of the energy density in the Universe is in the form of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Furthermore, neutrinos, the most elusive particles in nature, are found to be massive and undergo mixing and oscillations among the different types --- a phenomenon beyond the Standard Model. These discoveries bring an unprecedented convergence of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology in which observations of galaxies along with accelerator and reactor experiments will yield insights beyond the Standard Models, with the tantalizing possibility that a new species of neutrinos may explain Dark Matter. Professor Boyanovsky's research program seeks a fundamental understanding on two fronts: (i) the production and properties of a new species of neutrinos as possible Dark-Matter candidates, and (ii) a firmer assessment of the quantum fluctuations generated in the primordial Universe that ultimately seed the formation of galaxies. The program is at the forefront of particle astrophysics and cosmology, complements robust experimental and observational efforts, and is truly interdisciplinary as it implements methods from other fields in physics. Research in these areas thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of the most fundamental and stimulating endeavors of deep intellectual merit: the discovery of novel phenomena and the understanding of the evolution of our Universe and the origin of galaxies beginning from the smallest constituents. Through this cross-fertilization of concepts and methods, this research program also provides students with a broader perspective and unique opportunity to acquire a truly interdisciplinary educational experience. <br/><br/>Specifically, Professor Boyanovsky will study mechanisms for production, evolution, and gravitational clustering of new species of neutrinos during the early stages of the Early Universe by implementing methods from out-of-equilibrium quantum field theory and from quantum kinetics. These powerful methods will allow a systematic assessment of the new species of neutrinos as a Dark-Matter candidate. In cosmology, the program will focus on a deeper understanding of quantum processes and correlations during the inflationary stage in the early Universe. In particular, Professor Boyanovsky will study modifications of the spectrum of fluctuations from interactions and pre- and post-inflationary dynamics and their potential for detection with forthcoming observations. The study of processes during the period of rapid inflationary expansion requires novel tools. New methods based on concepts borrowed from quantum optics, such as quantum master equations, and out-of-equilibrium effective field theory, will provide a deeper and more fundamental assessment of possible observational consequences."
0.055,"The Physics REU Site at AAMU is a 10-week summer program that provides research opportunities to 24 talented undergraduate students from institutions with limited or no access to basic research in science and engineering. The project broadens the participation of members of groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, especially women. The program attracts physics undergraduates from minority serving institutions with limited opportunities to be involved in active research. The participants will gain experience in technical writing and presenting their research work to a variety of audiences, including dissemination of their results in local, regional, and national scientific conferences focused on undergraduate research and publishing in refereed journals. By training undergraduates in research, the goal is to produce skillful professionals who will contribute to the technological advancement and economic development of the nation. Through this program participants will be able to enhance their professional and personal portfolio by making unique advancements in experimental design, instrumentation, data acquisition and analysis, as well as engaging in a hands-on research experience with state-of-the-art equipment. Participating students will be actively engaged in cutting-edge research under the direct supervision of dedicated faculty mentors throughout the completion of self-contained ten-week projects in a collaborative research environment. Each participant will have an individual research project funded by an external funding agency with one-on-one mentoring from a faculty member through individual guidance as well as ample interactions with graduate students. The projects will include frontier research in Materials Science, Optics, Bio-photonics, Space Science, and Nanotechnology. The primary goal of the program is to increase the students' knowledge, skills, and communication capabilities in different areas of physics; inspiring them to pursue graduate work in STEM fields, where the underrepresentation of women and minorities is particularly acute. Exposure to a dynamic and diverse research in physics enhances the REU participants' understanding of scientific research and broadens their perspective on related professional careers in STEM."
0.27,"An important quest in modern nuclear physics concerns the theoretical understanding of the structure of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in terms of quarks, antiquarks and gluons, the degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of strong interactions. In this project, the investigator and his students will advance the development of theory necessary to understand experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and other facilities world-wide. In addition to providing theoretical support for existing and future experimental programs, the benefits of this project include training for graduate students. The project will also offer research opportunities for undergraduate students at the frontiers of theoretical nucleon structure research.<br/><br/>This project will explore nucleon structure in terms of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). Based on a QCD factorization formalism, TMDs are a useful tool in the study of high-energy reactions. As compared to the familiar and better known collinear parton distribution functions which describe processes when no final-state transverse momenta are resolved, TMDs offer detailed information about dynamics. They provide access to parton orbital motion and aspects of spin-orbit correlations when polarized beams and targets are explored. The goal of this project is to advance the current understanding of the properties of TMDs in a non-perturbative framework. The specific objectives of the project are: (1) determine the non-perturbative properties of TMDs at a low initial scale, (2)identify model-independent signatures of chiral symmetry breaking with focus on sea quark effects, (3) explore phenomenological applications and present predictions for experiments. The tools employed in this project include the use of perturbative evolution equations, dynamical models, and effective chiral theories."
0.302397,"Ground-based gamma-ray observations have revolutionized the field of high energy particle astrophysics over the past decade. Supernova remnants, pulsars, active galactic nuclei, starburst galaxies and stellar-mass binary systems have all been shown to emit very high energy gamma-radiation, along with sources whose identification is still unclear. The detection of gamma-rays indicates that these objects are accelerating particles to almost the speed of light, but the acceleration mechanisms, and the connection between the accelerators and the origin of cosmic rays remains unclear. Using the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory the Delaware group has led studies in many areas of gamma-ray astrophysics, including supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, active galaxies and searches for dark matter annihilation. The PI is currently the spokesperson for the VERITAS collaboration. With this award the University of Delaware group will continue their broad scientific program as well as technical work associated with the VERITAS observatory. The Delaware group will also continue its education and public outreach activities. Members of the group mentor students at the high school and undergraduate level, give public astrophysics presentations, and support the VERITAS outreach program. The group will continue to organize an annual ""Fermi Summer School"" that caters to graduate students and post-docs from around the world. Finally, as Spokesperson, the PI will communicate VERITAS science to the general public, and to the wider scientific community, through interactions with the press and with various scientific organizations.<br/><br/>The astrophysics activities funded through this award are both scientific and technical. Firstly, the group will use gamma-ray observations with VERITAS to study sites of particle acceleration, and specifically supernova remnants, gamma-ray binary systems, and blazars, through deep observations of known sources, and discovery observations of new candidates. They will also search for high gamma-ray emission from regions of excess astrophysical neutrinos as identified by IceCube. Secondly, the group will contribute to the maintenance and improvements to the capabilities of VERITAS. This consists of hardware maintenance of the upgraded telescope camera pixels, and the development of new analysis methods to improve sensitivity. Finally, the group will work on the commissioning of a prototype telescope at the VERITAS site for the next generation Cherenkov Telescope Array project."
0.165858,"Nuclei are among the most complex systems that emerge from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, and it is of great importance to understand their emergence quantitatively. This goal is only now beginning to be realized in practice using Lattice QCD and effective field theory methods. The focus of the proposed project is on obtaining physical predictions for basic nuclear interactions and properties with controlled uncertainties - arising primarily from extrapolation to the physical quark masses and to the continuum limit - accounted for systematically. Among the nuclear physics questions that this research project is focused on answering are: Which two- and three-baryon systems are bound and what are their binding energies? Are there three-body bound systems involving hyperons? What are the low-energy hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon phase shifts, and how will knowledge of these quantities help unravel the role of hyperons and hypernuclei in dense matter such as might occur in the core of neutron stars? <br/><br/>This research will help provide a link between long-observed properties of atomic nuclei and the theoretical framework that is believed to provide a basis for these observations, by taking advantages of advances in computing technology and developments in theoretical physics that have only recently made this effort possible. Graduate student training forms an integral part of this project, and will provide education in theoretical physics as well as forefront computing methods."
0.325854,"Astrophysical objects can accelerate particles to energies beyond the reach of any ground-based accelerator yet built. What drives this acceleration is an important question in astrophysics. High energy gamma-ray emission is a key diagnostic and can be used to probe the acceleration mechanisms. With this award the University of Iowa particle astrophysics group will use the VERITAS imaging air Cherenkov telescope for a systematic study of pulsar wind nebulae, the most common galactic high energy gamma-ray sources. Studies of Pulsar Wind Nebulae address central questions in high-energy astrophysics including the acceleration mechanism and the propagation of relativistic particles in the interstellar medium. To extend the broader impacts of this work, each year the Iowa group will host an undergraduate summer intern from an underrepresented minority who will be directly involved in the research. This program will draw on the success of the minority recruitment program of the Math Department at Iowa, including their extensive network of colleges with large minority enrollments, and the connections of the Adler Planetarium with minority-serving institutions in the Chicago area. In addition, the group will work to increase public interest in astronomy and broadly disseminate the results of their research through the public astronomical observing program run by the local chapter of the Society of Physics Students.<br/><br/>Pulsar wind nebulae are powered by relativistic particles accelerated in the termination shocks of the winds emanating from rotation-powered pulsars. The Iowa group will study the whole population of pulsar wind nebulae in the northern hemisphere using VERITAS follow-up observations of sources discovered by Milagro and in the near future by HAWC forming an unbiased survey. The goal is to produce a complete inventory of powerful, nearby leptonic particle accelerators in the northern sky. The group will also conduct detailed observations of selected pulsar wind nebulae at multiple wavebands to constrain their physical properties. The Iowa group will also continue to operate and maintain the VERITAS pointing monitors and contribute to VERITAS operations."
0.56,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Stojkovic, Kinney, and Wackeroth at the State University of New York, University at Buffalo. The goal of this research project is to make important progress in providing answers to key open questions at the frontier of of particle physics, cosmology and gravity research, and in doing so to go significantly beyond the current state of the art in the field. The PIs propose individual research programs with elements which will be executed jointly. New particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and envisioned successors are probing new physics at the energy frontier and are capable of providing answers to important questions about the structure and history of the universe. On the other hand, cosmology provides a unique laboratory to study questions in physics inaccessible to traditional particle physics methods, and forms a valuable complement to accelerators. Our current understanding of the fundamental problems about the origin, evolution and future of our universe is still in its infancy, and a synthesis of many independent lines of evidence will be necessary to point the way to explanations. This project reflects that synergy, and promises to make significant progress in connecting high-precision cosmological and accelerator data to fundamental questions such as the origin and evolution of the universe, the unification of gravitation with quantum mechanics, the role of the vacuum in the structure of space and time. In addition the PIs will continue with their very active and successful presentation of the latest scientific results to a wide public in the form of public talks and various outreach activities. These will include The Science Exploration Day, Physics Open House, and Family Day. Kinney (with active participation of Stojkovic and Wackeroth) will continue organizing Science and Art Cabaret} - a unique mix of cutting-edge science and technology with art, music, poetry, and performance, and the At UB Symposium, a new interdisciplinary lecture series with a prototype event being held in 2013.<br/><br/><br/>Stojkovic's research will span topics within his expertise from particle physics to cosmology. Part of his research will be focused to the LHC physics, in particular on further development of a comprehensive LHC event generator BlackMax which is extensively used by ATLAS and CMS in search for exotic physics, and understanding implications of the recent Higgs discovery on gravity and cosmology (in collaboration with Wackeroth). Part of his research will be dedicated to cosmology, in particular to studying predictions of a recently proposed class of inflationary models (in collaboration with Kinney), as well as studying new puzzling patterns in quasar light curves which seem to be closely related to the quasars' redshifts. The main goal of Kinney's research is to make quantitative connections between new observational data and detailed properties of the early universe to address fundamental questions such as: What is the energy scale of cosmological inflation? What is the form of the leading-order operator in the inflationary potential? Is the inflationary Lagrangian consistent with a simple canonical field theory? Is there evidence for quantum gravity effects, for example a Planck-scale cutoff in quantum modes? Can we explain CMB anomalies, such as the hemispherical asymmetry observed by Planck? Are there viable alternatives to inflation? What properties do they have? Wackeroth will concentrate on the precision electroweak (EW) physics, in particular on corrections to W and Z boson production in hadronic collisions, improving predictions for H,W, Z production in association with heavy quarks, and NLO EW corrections to triple EW gauge boson production with non-standard couplings. This work will be directly relevant to analysis of upcoming LHC data."
2.37,"This award is one component of a collaborative effort to fund the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) Science Education Center Partnership between Southern University in Baton Rouge (SUBR), LA, and the LIGO Livingston site in Livingston, La, through the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF). The managing institution for LIGO itself is California Institute of technology. The entire partnership includes the LIGO Laboratory, SUBR's College of Education and Physics, Mathematics, and Science/Mathematics Education Departments, the Louisiana Systemic Initiatives Program (LaSIP) and Louisiana Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (LA GEAR UP), under the LA Board of Regents, and the San Francisco Exploratorium. The LIGO Science Education Partnership is a project that combines the efforts of a cutting-edge research laboratory, a university, a State educational reform agency, and a leading museum that specializes in informal science education. The focus of the project is the creation of an effective center for teacher training and teacher education centered on LIGO activities in Louisiana. A previous award helped create the SEC building, with a classroom and a large exhibit hall, with exhibits developed by the Exploratorium and staffed by SUBR student docents and a (separately funded) professional staff. This new award will extend and strengthen this success, and begin several new activities, including studies of the way children learn in both informal and formal settings supported by this award, and the effectiveness of the teacher professional development supported by this award. These new activities will both provide scholarly work on informal and formal science education but will also provide feedback to the project which can be used to increase the effectiveness of the activities."
0.239079,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator. It is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson. One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work proposed here will analyze data from the CMS experiment, looking for signals of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. <br/><br/>This award will fund two aspects of the CMS experiment: 1) further searches for BSM physics and 2) help build the CMS Phase I forward pixel detector (FPix) upgrade, which will enhance the ability of CMS to discover BSM physics. The CMS physics analysis supported by this award will focus on Supersymmetry(SUSY) and Dark Matter, both proposed BSM. A means of identifying b-quarks in the CMS data ( b-tagging) will be further developed and refined by this award. One SUSY candidate is the stop quark, the supersymmetric partner of the SM top quark. Decay products of stop quarks involve top quarks and b-tagging is the tool to find events with top quarks. In addition, events with directly produced top quarks serve as backgrounds to signal events that contain top squarks. The CMS Pixel Detector is the tool to efficiently provide precise tracking and b-tagging needed for SUSY searches. The award also provides important parts of the FPix upgrade which are being tested at FermiLab. The CMS Forward pixel upgrade will allow the precise vertex location, needed for all physics studies, even in the harsh environment (very high luminosity) expected in near future LHC running. The CMS Forward Pixel Detector uses state-of-the art silicon technology for particle detection combined with equally sophisticated readout electronics. Innovative techniques of radiation hard technology and bump bonding have been used in the current detector to meet the real estate challenges in a high radiation environment. These techniques would greatly enhance the life span of detectors used in outer space research and improve bio-sensing miniature devices for medical applications."
0.11,"Astronomical observations have shown that virtually all massive galaxies can be expected to have a supermassive black hole residing at their center. Surrounded by dense star clusters, these black holes will frequently capture stars into highly eccentric orbits. A fraction of these stars will be compact objects: stellar mass black holes or neutron stars. As these compact stars orbit, they radiate gravitational waves, causing the orbit to decay and the star to eventually be swallowed by the supermassive black hole. The emitted radiation is potentially observable in future space-based gravitational wave detectors. The theoretical work funded by this award will provide better understanding of the expected signals from highly-eccentric compact merging binaries. Detection of gravitational waves from such extreme-mass-ratio binaries will provide a unique strong-field test of gravity and a probe of the nature of black holes. This award contributes to scientific workforce development through the involvement of graduate students and the training they receive in physical modeling, mathematical analysis, and numerical and computational methods.<br/><br/>In greater detail, the primary research efforts associated with this award are: (1) refined development of two accurate mathematical and numerical gravitational self-force methods, and the associated computer codes, that are useful for computing gravitational waves from merging compact binaries with small mass ratios and highly eccentric orbits; (2) using one such method to make highly accurate comparisons of calculated gravitational waves with the distinct and complementary post-Newtonian approach; and (3) using the second numerical self-force method to calculate the orbital decay, gravitational wave emission, and merger of eccentric binaries in the late stages of their orbital decay."
0.044959,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of nature and is described by Einstein's theory of general relativity. One of the most extreme predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes, compact objects whose gravity is so intense that not even light can escape from them. Investigating gravity in such an extreme regime provides one of the most promising opportunities to learn more about this fundamental force. Another prediction of general relativity, that binary black holes emit gravitational waves that stretch and squeeze spacetime, was recently confirmed by the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Black holes are fully described by their masses and spins, but the spins of binary black holes are generally misaligned with their orbital plane, much like the 23 degree misalignment between the Earth's rotation axis and its orbit about the Sun responsible for the seasons. General relativity causes black-hole spins to change direction or precess; this precession leaves detectable signatures in the gravitational waves observed by LIGO. This award supports studies on black-hole spin precession and the extent to which it can be constrained by gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO. This work helps scientists to interpret LIGO observations and thus better understand gravity and the astrophysical origin of black holes responsible for their spin misalignments. The PI and collaborators will also develop an interactive virtual-reality simulation of precessing black holes and the gravitational waves they emit which will be available free online and presented at local public libraries and museums through existing outreach networks of the University of Texas at Dallas. These simulations help the public virtually experience the effects of gravitational waves and enhance public interest and support for science research and education.<br/><br/>This goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive picture of the origin and implications of misalignments between binary black-hole spins and their orbital angular momentum. Population-synthesis codes will be used to explore how initial spin misalignments depend on various aspects of astrophysical black-hole formation like mass transfer, tidal alignment, and supernova recoils. The spin distributions generated by these codes will be evolved from black-hole formation until they begin to emit detectable gravitational waves using the PI's newly developed technique for efficiently calculating spin precession on the inspiral timescale. Once the binaries enter the sensitivity band of ground-based detectors like LIGO, publicly available codes in the LIGO Algorithm Library Suite will be used to generate waveforms and analyze how well the binary black-hole parameters that determine spin precession can be estimated for realistic signal-to-noise ratios. The PI and collaborators will also perform and analyze numerical-relativity simulations to assess the reliability of post-Newtonian predictions for spin precession in the final orbits before black-hole merger. This research provides the basis for astrophysical model selection, combining constraints on spin misalignments from many events to distinguish astrophysical models of black-hole formation, such as dynamical formation in a globular cluster (for which spins should be isotropic) versus formation from stellar binaries (which should exhibit a tendency towards aligned spins). The final project will consider how spin precession between black hole formation and merger affects predictions for final black-hole masses, spins, and gravitational recoils. This project has implications both for the stellar-mass black holes observed by LIGO and recoiling quasars spatially or kinematically offset from their host galaxies sought in galaxy surveys."
0.032765,"This award supports research that will have a broad impact upon our understanding of the applications of General Relativity to extreme astrophysical systems, upon science education, and upon understanding and appreciation of science by the public. The detection of gravitational waves, either on Earth or in space, is opening a new window on the universe. Such detections will allow new tests of our current theory of gravity when applied to the most extreme systems imaginable. Likely sources of these waves include binary systems of black holes and neutron stars and solar mass objects orbiting and eventually spiraling into very large black holes - one thousand to ten billion times the mass of the Sun. These sources include some of the most surprising objects in the universe. New analysis is being developed to more efficiently describe the spacetime dynamics of systems of compact objects, such as rotating black hole binaries, which evolve through the emission of gravitational waves. The experimental effort leading toward the detection of gravitational waves and, ultimately, the analysis of the source characteristics will directly benefit from accurate theoretical prediction of the orbital trajectories.<br/><br/>To pursue this work, the exploration of gravitational self force effects will continue. A new comparison between numerical and analytical (post-Newtonian) results will be made once second order numerical data becomes available from the self force community. This work is carried out in collaboration with colleagues at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris and with a postdoc at UF. Confidence in the regularization required for both self force and post-Newtonian calculations will be increased, as will understanding of the post-Newtonian expansion itself. New gauge invariant quantities, with second and higher order derivatives acting on the metric, will be systematically investigated for perturbations of the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, and equations which they satisfy will be sought. This latter effort will be carried out in collaboration with a colleague in Southampton University, and with several mathematical colleagues with ties to the Albert Einstein Institute in Golm, Germany. The similarities and differences between problems in the Schwarzschild and Kerr geometries will be carefully analyzed with a view to making self force calculations in the Kerr spacetime background more efficient."
0.015,"The workshop on ""Quantitative Laws:"" in Statistical Physics and Biology will be held in Lake Como, Italy in June 2016. The purpose of this workshop is to communicate the foundations and advances in research in key cutting-edge areas at the interface of statistical physics and biology, by means of lecture, discussion and dialogue amongst junior and advanced researchers. The unifying theme of this workshop is quantitative laws emerging in ecosystems, but a more general aim is to provide a wide perspective on the connections of this discipline with cellular physiology on one side and to complex systems on the other. The workshop will provide the necessary methodological tools and perspectives to enable a junior researcher to understand and perform cutting-edge research in these areas. It will primarily target PhD students and postdocs with a physics or mathematics background, but it is open to anyone with background in (evolutionary) genomics, (evolutionary) biology, bioinformatics, ecology, who is interested in quantitative work. The workshop is divided in two themes, centered on results, discoveries and methods at the interface of statistical physics and biology in the areas of (1) physiology to ecology and (2) interaction structures to collective behavior. <br/><br/>The discovery of recurring, quantitative patterns in biological systems across living systems from scales of molecules to ecosystems has led to the increasing development of an interface field between statistical physics and biology. This interface is enabled by the meaningful involvement of both physicists and bioscientists, focusing on relevant problems and leveraging theoretic methods from non-equilibrium statistical physics, probability theory, network theory, and large-scale simulation. Over 15 international speakers with expertise in the physics of living systems will develop foundational lectures as well as advanced research topics to engage students and postdocs entering this emerging field in a workshop/school format. The workshop will be unique in its integration of detailed quantitative and physics-based methods into the core analysis of data and problems in applications areas including genomics, cell biology, microbiology, ecology evolution, immunology and virology. Funds will support approximately 10 US-based PhD candidates and postdoctoral scientists to participate in an international workshop at the interface between multiple disciplines, including statistical physics and the biosciences, with applications to genomics, cell biology, microbiology, ecology evolution, immunology and virology. Recruitment will be targeted broadly in the United States, including student-based associations specifically supporting the inclusion of under-represented groups in cutting-edge scientific programs."
0.006,"The workshop titled, ""Molecular coevolution: lessons from pathogen-immune system interactions"", will be held on 11th-12th April 2016, at the Princeton Center for Theoretical Sciences (PCTS). It will bring together theoreticians and experimentalists who study adaptive immunity in vertebrates or in bacteria. Adaptive mechanisms for immunity have evolved to mount a flexible and diverse response and to counteract the rapid evolution of pathogens to enhance organismal survival. The participants of this program work at the cutting edge of research into such immune dynamics. The goal is to foster new collaborations that build and test predictive approaches to coevolution of pathogens and the immune system. Predictive modeling is an essential component for understanding the fundamental science of the immune system. Such basic science advances will eventually enable advances in medicine. Close to half of the participants in this workshop are females, helping to increase diversity and participation of women in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The immune systems in vertebrates and in bacteria have evolved remarkable mechanisms for adapting to a diverse and constantly changing pathogenic environments. In vertebrates, new receptors are constantly generated by genomic recombination, and those that successfully detect threats are selectively amplified to protect the host. Some of the stimulated receptors are retained to form a memory of past infections, and thus to mount a rapid response against future infections of a similar type. This process of affinity maturation in an adaptive immune system constitutes a Darwinian evolution of the immune cells that occurs during the lifetime of an organism. By contrast, in some bacteria and archaea, immunity is directly acquired from interactions with the environment, and is heritable to future generations. These bacteria use the CRISPR-Cas mechanism to acquire specific genomic sequences from attacking phages (viruses that attack bacteria), and use these sequences to target future invaders. In both cases, the rapid turnover of pathogens to escape the adaptive immune response creates an evolutionary arms race at the molecular level. Understanding the complex dynamics of these adaptive immune systems in response to coevolving pathogens is only possible through a joint theoretical and experimental effort. This workshop will focus on a number of questions at this interface, including: (i) what does it mean for an immune repertoire to be ""well-adapted"", (ii) how can the actual dynamics of the adaptive system reach such a well-adapted state?, (iii) how should, and how does, the adaptive system react to an evolving pathogenic environment, and (iv) what are the molecular signatures of coevolution between viruses and the immune system, and how can we detect those from the biological data? This workshop will bring together many of the leading experts on these topics."
0.16,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Jonathan Heckman at the University of North Carolina (UNC)at Chapel Hill. This research will focus on using string theory to understand the workings of Nature at the shortest distance scales. Strings continue to have significant impact on theoretical physics, with interdisciplinary connections ranging from the physics of subatomic particles to pure mathematics. One of the most important open issues is how to connect this framework to experimentally verified theories of subatomic particles. This project aims to use the geometry of extra dimensions predicted by string theory to construct and study theoretical models of relevance both for theories of subatomic particles, and for more formal mathematical applications.<br/><br/>The education and outreach efforts of this program will introduce students to the power of geometric methods in theoretical physics. 1) At the postdoc and graduate level, the PI will maintain a collaborative research environment. 2) The PI will develop a course on geometric methods in high energy theory. 3) At the undergraduate level, the PI will advise students on geometric and computational aspects of string theory through the UNC REU program on computational methods in physics held in his department. 4) The PI will work closely with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center to develop a set of outreach modules aimed at conveying the broad range of energy scales which are actively being investigated by high energy theorists and experimentalists.<br/><br/>The technical components of this program will focus on the development of new tools in the study of string compactification at strong coupling, and the resulting low energy effective field theories. Particular emphasis will be placed on compactifications of F-theory. This will entail developing the correspondence between the open string degrees of freedom in the worldvolume theory of intersecting seven-branes, and closed string degrees of freedom captured by elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds. Additional components will entail the development of specific string-motivated scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Models of particle physics and cosmology. Particle physics applications will include the study of kinetic mixing with a strongly coupled extra sector. Cosmology applications will include the development of inflationary reheating scenarios coupled to concrete stringy particle physics models. This project will also focus on using the geometry of F-theory compactifications as a tool to classify and study superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in diverse dimensions. This will include a classification of 6D SCFTs, the construction of new 4D N = 1 SCFTs from D3-brane probes of singular Calabi-Yau fourfold geometries, and the development of 2D SCFTs with N = (0,2) supersymmetry from compactification on singular elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fivefolds."

These contributions have come most recently through participation in the BaBar Experiment, whose active operations have ended, but whose data legacy is extensive and is being currently mined for important physics results. The Cincinnati group is now transitioning to the LHCb experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, which is currently in an intense data-taking phase for 2012, and which will segue into an analysis and upgrade phase during the period 2013-2014.<br/><br/>In the physics of BaBar, Cincinnati is focusing on a mixing analysis of neutral D decays, on a precision measurement of the mass difference between charged and neutral D mesons, and absolute mass measurements of charged and neutral D mesons. At LHCb the group will work on charm mixing and CP Violation, studies that can assess indirectly high mass scales and provide powerful constraints on models for new physics beyond the standard model. Among the processes of interest are three-body decays of neutral D mesons with Kshort mesons in the final state and amplitude analyses of four-body neutral D decays. Technically, the group intends to make contributions to the LHCb High Level Trigger with emphasis on increasing the efficiency of charm decays, and notably increasing the sensitivity to triggering on Kshort mesons. For the LHCb upgrades, the group will be working on tracking simulation, and in the domain of core computing, the group will contribute to the maintenance of the Conditions Database.<br/><br/>The Cincinnati group has a strong record in education and outreach, and has had a very active QuarkNet Center since 2004, which offers local and regional high school teachers and students several opportunities. Among these are opportunities for teachers and students to participate directly in the research program; participation in QuarkNet International Masterclasses; and through their annual Teachers' Institute, the group has helped local high school teachers introduce particle physics and related topics in modern physics into their courses."
0.07,"In this project the PI, using a combination of theory, simulations and experiments, will investigate the complexities of lipid membranes. The project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter to study the organization of biological membranes. The modeling efforts will develop new and novel mathematics and new numerical schemes to solve the resulting differential equations. The current understanding of how multi-component giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) respond to osmotic pressure differentials is incomplete, and experimental observations indicate that a non-linear model coupling membrane dynamics with 3D fluid flow is needed to fully explain the non-linearities of the system. Developing this theoretical framework and providing insight into the underlying physics is crucial for the understanding of how membranes undergo morphological transitions. These models will explain existing experiments and also predict membrane response to different osmotic loads and membrane compositions. Understanding this process is important for better experimental design of in vitro reconstituted systems such as vesicles and also cellular systems. The work is inherently interdisciplinary, using mathematics and physics in biological systems. Both fields will benefit from this approach to studying biological phenomena; the theory will be grounded in experiments and also make predictions to design future experiments. This research will be integrated into the teaching efforts of the PIs in developing new courses at the interface of engineering and biology. The PIs will continue their efforts in enhancing diversity in the UC system while pursuing the research program. <br/><br/>Biological membranes are inherently heterogeneous mixtures of lipids and proteins. A key characteristic of this heterogeneity is the coexistence of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. This coexistence is thought to be the key organizing principle for the formation of lipid rafts. Studying the formation and organization of the different phases in cellular system is experimentally challenging, given the complex nature of the cells. Giant unilamellar vesicles with controlled compositions, allow us to study lipid behavior in bilayer membranes and gain insight into phase behavior which is important for understanding cellular membranes. Although GUVs are used widely experimentally, our theoretical understanding of lipid phase separation remains rudimentary, since existing models focus on the line tension between preexisting domains and not on domain growth and swell-burst cycles, which are the features observed experimentally. The objectives of this project are to formulate quantitative models of isothermal phase separation and swell-burst cycle in multi-component GUVs and test model predictions experimentally. STUDY 1-DYNAMICS OF SOLUTE EFFLUX. We will use theory, simulations, and experiments to understand the factors that control pore radius, vesicle radius, and the lifetime of the pore. STUDY 2-PHASE SEPARATION IN OSMOTICALLY STRESSED VESICLES. Using a viscoelastic model of multi-component lipid membranes, we will investigate the role of governing energetics in domain growth versus true phase transitions. We will experimentally test the model predictions by tuning the osmotic pressure difference, lipid composition, and sample temperature. STUDY 3-COUPLING BETWEEN DOMAIN FORMATION AND SWELL-BURST CYCLES. In this study, we will develop the mathematical framework to model the complete dynamics of the oscillatory phase separation coupled with the swell-burst cycle observed in the preliminary experiments. This model will combine the dynamics of pore formation outlined in Study 1, with the domain growth model including membrane viscosity in Study 2. The significance of the proposed activities lies in its promise to not only elucidate the fundamental properties of mixtures of lipids reduced dimensional, bilayer configuration but also furnish design principles for designing synthetic protocellular compartments for applications spanning in vitro production of proteins, chemistry in confinement, and delivery of biomedically relevant cargo (e.g., enzymes, drugs, and imaging agents). Using a combination of theory, simulations and experiments, this work will be able to provide insight into the complexities of lipid membranes. The long-term impact of the proposed activities stems from the fact that the project combines concepts from the fields of polymer physics, membrane mechanics and bioengineering, surface and interface science, and soft condensed matter.

0.05,"This grant supports investigation on large quantum fluctuations of energy density and pressure and their physical effects. Recent work by the PI and his collaborators has shown that these fluctuations are much less rare than previously thought. Large pressure fluctuations may be able to push quantum particles, such as electrons, over potential barriers at a rate which might be observable and have technological consequences. Large energy density fluctuations can cause the nucleation of bubbles of a new phase in the early universe, which could play a role in the evolution of the universe. These fluctuations can also alter the gravitational field and influence the propagation of light rays. This is an effect of quantum gravity, and its study will help to elucidate the relation between quantum theory and relativity theory, which is one of the unsolved problems of theoretical physics. The project will also study analog models for quantum gravity involving nonlinear optics, and the results may lead to a deeper understanding of optics, as well as quantum gravity. Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research. Some of the results of the project should help to illustrate subtle concepts of quantum theory and relativity to students.<br/><br/>This research will focus on the probability distributions for spacetime averages of quantum stress tensor operators. Past work on this topic has focused only on time averages. Here the effects of spatial averaging will also be included. The applications of the probability distributions to several systems will also be investigated. These include the effects of stress tensor fluctuations in enhancing the rates for quantum barrier penetration and in increasing the rates of false vacuum decay, both of which could have significant applications. The role of stress tensor fluctuations in driving spacetime geometry fluctuations will also be studied. One effect of geometry fluctuations will be light cone fluctuations. One approach to be used is an analog model in which squared electric field vacuum fluctuations in a nonlinear dielectric cause light speed fluctuations. This effect can give useful insights into quantum gravity effects, and is of interest in its own right and might be experimentally observable. The role of stress tensor fluctuation in cosmological models will also be studied."

This work will also contribute to the study of known blazars and the discoveries of new blazars, a class of Active Galactic Nuclei. The scientific goals are to study the astrophysical processes that generate gamma-ray emission in blazars and the links to the origin of observed ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The University of Minnesota group will mentor undergraduate students through the university's Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. Members of the group will continue to present VERITAS science at local astronomy clubs, high schools and other public outreach events such as the weekly public observing nights at the campus observatory. <br/><br/>The major objectives and methods to be employed by the University of Minnesota group include: (1) development of improved analysis techniques including implementation of a multivariate analysis toolkit and a new effort in better spectral reconstruction; (2) scientific analysis on Active Galactic Nuclei utilizing new spectral analysis techniques with a focus on locating the source of gamma-ray emission in blazars and understanding the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays; (3) coordination of multi-wavelength data campaigns in conjunction with VERITAS including efforts with Fermi, IceCube and HAWC; and (4) calibration and data quality monitoring tasks that include improvements on understanding of the instrument energy scale through a detailed study on the impact of atmospheric conditions on the reconstructed energy."

However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces and the development of concepts that now constitute what we call physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).

This is increasingly important as the limits for new physics by CMS and ATLAS increase, the only window may turn out to be in the studies of rare decays. This work will concentrate mostly on charm quark physics, the expertise of the group. These charm channels can show BSM physics in CP violation and other parity violating asymmetries.

0.045929,"A century after Einstein predicted their existence, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has made the first observation of gravitational waves--ripples of warped space and time. The waves came from a pair of merging black holes over a billion light years away. This award will help scientists to observe as many gravitational waves as possible while learning as much as possible about the waves' astronomical sources. Specifically, this award supports a research program that uses supercomputers to predict the gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars and to study the most important source of noise limiting LIGO's reach. Through their participation in this program, students at California State University Fullerton, a primarily undergraduate-serving and Hispanic-serving institution, will learn transferable skills in research and computing while playing important roles in the inauguration of a new era in astronomy. The imminent gravitational-wave discoveries could dramatically change our understanding of the universe.<br/><br/>This award renews support for California State University Fullerton's computational gravitational-wave research program. The PI and undergraduate and master's-level researchers will address two crucial challenges in computational gravitational-wave physics using high performance computing. First, they will use the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) to model merging black holes and neutron stars--the most promising sources for Advanced LIGO--focusing on the challenging but astrophysically important case of rapid black-hole spins. The resulting simulated gravitational waveforms will help maximize LIGO's reach, in part by leading to better approximate waveform models for future LIGO searches; the simulations will also reveal how warped spacetime behaves under extreme conditions never before modeled. Second, the PI and student researchers will use high-performance computing to model thermal noise--one of the most significant fundamental limits to detectors' astrophysical sensitivities--focusing on a highly promising avenue for improvement, crystalline mirror materials. Leveraging these highly sophisticated techniques will allow for breakthroughs in the understanding of the fluctuations in complex elastic structures, including mirrors with crystalline coatings. These new insights will allow for substantial improvements in the thermal noise of high precision measurements, currently a limiting noise source for gravitational-wave detection, atomic clocks, and inertial sensing."

The UT, which replaces the current tracker, will consists of four planes of single-sided 250 micron thick silicon strip detectors, read out by a custom-made front-end electronic integrated circuit. With its reduced material budget and optimized segmentation as a function of the distance from the beam line, it plays a crucial role in reducing the rate of fake tracks and in providing fast momentum measurements in the residual field of the dipole magnet. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The broader impacts of this work span several areas.

As with all measurement techniques, the goals of a magnetometry measurement are to reach a sensitivity that will allow the detection of smaller and smaller quantities and a resolution that will allow pinpointing location to smaller and smaller sizes. The research supported under this CAREER award will incorporate ultracold BECs into proven optical measurement methods for atom magnetometry, which relies on atomic signals for detection, that were previously based on techniques using hot atomic vapors. The new cold atom approach will make it possible to develop magnetometers with enhanced magnetic field sensitivity and spatial resolution. Beyond the important research goals, this CAREER award will provide excellent opportunities to introduce students to modern developments in quantum physics, to involve them in research projects, and to prepare them for a career in science and technology. Two new laboratory courses in physics will be developed to better prepare the students for advanced research. Active efforts will be undertaken to broaden the participation of under-represented groups in this project by involving Native American students, women in physics, and potential ?first-generation? college students in research and educational activities.

While the nature of intense laser interactions with atoms, molecules, and solids has been studied for many years, exactly how intense laser pulses interact with objects that are of a spatial scale comparable to the light's wavelength (less than a millionth of a meter) is largely unexplored. We will focus a 20 TW laser - a laser with nearly ten times the power of that on the entire US electrical grid - onto wavelength-scale targets and study the resulting electron and ions energies to study the mechanisms by which laser energy is absorbed by the target. The scientific merit of this work rests in filling this gap in our knowledge of physics, and in developing improved x-ray and neutron sources. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The broader scientific impacts of this research rest in advancing the understanding of high-intensity laser interactions with a class of targets not previously well explored. Application of these studies may aid in the development of improved x-ray sources for radiography and time-resolved diffraction, or compact neutron sources for imaging other systems. The broader educational impact of this work is found in the training that both graduate and undergraduate students will receive. Our work represents a unique collaboration in which an undergraduate group is directly and critically involved in strong-field-physics research, a field which is prohibitively resource intensive for an undergraduate research program to pursue alone. The undergraduates funded by this grant will have the opportunity to do research at HMC, travel to UT in the summers to participate in research using equipment they have developed, and travel to conferences to present their work to the scientific community.

0.309063,"The Universe as we know it evolved from a very hot, dense primordial soup of fundamental particles that were created in the cataclysm known as the Big Bang. As the Universe expanded and cooled, these fundamental particles, called quarks and gluons, condensed into protons and neutrons, which eventually combined into nuclei that captured electrons to form atoms. Nearly everything we can observe is made from this fundamental material. Using large particle accelerators, scientists are recreating the conditions at the birth of the Universe in the laboratory by colliding gold or lead atoms at very high energies to study the properties and interactions among these particles. These investigations will provide us with clues to the deeper nature of the fundamental forces in the Universe.<br/><br/>One of the most important discoveries to come from such experiments is that the dense matter created in these collisions is opaque to very high energy quarks and gluons produced in them. These ""partons"" suffer tremendous energy loss as they make their way out of the collision zone, depositing a large fraction of their initial energy in the medium. The strength of the energy loss is directly related to the density of the medium and varies according to the type of parton. It appears that the heavier the parton, the more energy loss it suffers. Energetic partons fragment into a spray of particles called a ""jet"". If a jet contains a high energy electron, there is a very high probability that it originated from a heavy quark. The energy loss of these electron-jets can be used to investigate the properties of the quark gluon plasma medium through which it passed. The goal of this research is to disentangle the energy loss of quarks and gluons by isolating jets containing electrons and comparing their energy loss patterns to those without electrons.<br/><br/>The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland collides nuclei at the highest energies ever created in a laboratory. This RUI project will utilize the ALICE experiment to explore the properties of the quark-gluon plasma using the energy loss of heavy quark jets as a probe. Undergraduate students working on this experiment will be trained in the most advanced data collection, reduction and analysis techniques at the cutting edge of high energy nuclear physics. They will be able to apply these skills in a wide variety of careers, whether they choose to pursue an advanced degree in basic science or not. Their contributions will also help us develop new understanding of the fundamental interactions among the basic building blocks of matter, leading to a deeper understanding of the Universe we inhabit."
0.555,"Fundamental properties of certain electromagneticwaves in plasmas are investigated. These waves, specifically known as whistler modes, are very important in space plasmas and in plasma processing and propulsion. They have not yet been studied in plasmas immersed in highly nonuniform magnetic fields that change within one wavelength or less. The waves are excited and measured in a large laboratory plasma with local magnetic fields produced by strong permanent magnets and current-carrying coils. Wave propagation, wave refraction and reflection, standing waves and nonlinear effects are obtained from detailed measurements of three vector components of the wave magnetic field in three dimensional space and time. The findings are expected to produce a new understanding of wave effects in space plasmas and to improve industrial plasma sources for plasma processing.<br/><br/>Specifically, whistler wave propagation will be studied near magnetic X- and O-type null points, magnetic neutral sheets and dipole fields with high mirror ratios. Such geometries are often found in space and laboratory plasmas, but there is little knowledge about the wave properties in a regime where the spatial changes of the magnetic field are comparable to the wavelength. Under those circumstances, different group and phase velocities are possible and complicate the wave propagation. The experiments produce complete data sets that provide valuable insight for the understanding of whistler-mediated reconnection, whistler eigenmodes on closed field lines, and whistler wave reflection at the lower hybrid frequency layer as well as whistler modes near lunar crustal magnetic fields, whistlers in small toroidal plasmas, and in helicon and magnetron discharges. Thus, the research will open up unexplored areas in plasma physics with broad relevance."

They will concentrate their studies at their home institution, a large public and primarily Hispanic-serving institution in south Florida. The proponents propose to examine both academic and social integration as they pertain to classrooms to address one of the most pressing problems in the physics community currently - improving diversity in physics while increasing overall numbers of students in physics. Such issues that affect the physics community are potentially relevant for most of engineering and computer science as well. <br/><br/>The program will address several questions in the Formal Learning Environment:<br/>1. How does the Modeling Instruction program promote student retention and persistence within the physics major?<br/>2. How do differing learning environments shape the formation of student networks, and how do they contribute to student retention and persistence?<br/><br/>And the program will address several questions in the Informal Learning Environment:<br/>1. What networks are created as a result of participating in a variety of semiformal learning environments? How does participating in these networks correlate with achievement outcomes and persistence?<br/>2. Can we utilize cross-sectional analyses to develop a predictive model of student engagement that ultimately can be used to correlate with persistence? What features are most prominent in a predictive model of student engagement?<br/><br/>Such questions have broad impact by developing understanding of mechanisms for supporting all students to persist in physics and with the unique student population at FIU, which is historically underrepresented in physics. Further, the development of network methods that are supported by qualitative education research can provide unique opportunities to uncover emergent network structures that support student participation in physics."
1.40077,"A broad range of astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates that 80% of the matter in the universe is in a new form which does not emit or absorb light, and has not yet been encountered in the laboratory. Many physics models suggest that the dark matter may be composed of one or more previously unobserved Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs. The astrophysical detection of such a particle through its interactions in a terrestrial particle detector would have a profound impact on cosmology and fundamental interactions, while also giving rise to a new type of observational astrophysics. This work supports key research and development and design efforts toward construction of a 7-ton liquid Xenon dark matter detector, known as 'LZ', to be installed at the 4850 level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. This detector will use established liquid Xenon Time Projection Chamber technology with read out of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification, together with 3-d position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the liquid Xenon, removal of surface artifacts and calibration of position-dependent response functions. The experiment will take advantage of existing infrastructure and detector components from the LUX experiment, which is currently being deployed into the mine, allowing a rapid turn-around at the conclusion of that experiment's life. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>By exploiting the natural curiosity of the public in dark matter as well as the connection and familiarity with gravity, this project will provide a rich environment in which to develop a range of activities from tours and displays to partnerships with local schools and individuals, aimed at fostering an interest in science and science careers. Through both LUX and LZ programs, the collaboration will continue to play a key role in the efforts at Sanford in education and public outreach programs. Dark matter science also demands the development of new technologies that are ultra-sensitive to radiation and new methods for achieving ultra-low radioactive backgrounds. There is direct overlap with the methods used in a wide range of nuclear security and medical imaging contexts. The instrument that will be developed will also provide direct educational and training benefits at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, and will promote basic science research by providing access to non-Ph.D. granting institutions, particularly those in geographical proximity to Lead, SD."

0.425,"According to the fundamental theory of how protons and neutrons form atomic nuclei, these particles are expected to melt into a soup of quarks and gluons known as the quark gluon plasma (QGP) at the high densities and temperatures that are created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a new phase of matter has been discovered. With its unprecedented reach in energy, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) explores new regions of this phase transition and will reveal its signatures. The PI's research investigates the properties of this new state of matter at high density and temperature in a quantitative manner through a study of internal probes.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>Jets are collimated sprays of decay products of hard-scattered quarks and gluons. Because their expected yields are calculable using the well understood theory of strong interactions, they provide calibrated probes of QGP. Since their propagation through the QGP is affected by strong interactions, an energy loss measurement of jets is an ideal probe to study the key features of this new state of matter. The PI's research group at Rutgers will determine the fundamental properties of this dense and hot matter via various complimentary jet measurements by utilizing the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at LHC. <br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/>The PI proposes a three-tiered approach to cultivate a diverse and competitive work force via integration of active research and education. She will encourage female middle and high school students to pursue university education in STEM fields by bringing them to Rutgers for full-day sessions of demos and experiments, recruit undergraduate physics majors by incorporating cutting-edge LHC research into her introductory physics courses and by organizing Women in Physics Conferences at Rutgers, and mentor women and minority students and include them in all phases of research."

This project will also offer great opportunities to engage undergraduate students in cutting edge research.

Measurements of various rare and forbidden decays of the eta mesons will provide sensitive probes for possible existence of new forces, which will extend our knowledge to the dark matter and explore new sources of CP violation needed to explain the matter and anti-matter asymmetry in the universe. The discovery of such new forces beyond Standard Model would have far-ranging implications to advance our understanding of nature."

1.26,"This award is primarily to carry out experiments with relativistic heavy ion collisions. The principal investigators are T. J. Humanic and M. A. Lisa, of the Department of Physics at The Ohio State University. Our goals for the high-energy program are threefold. Firstly, we will study the space-time properties of the extremely dense matter created at in collisions between heavy nuclei at the highest achievable energies. It is believed that this matter is a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), characterized by colored degrees of freedom at the microscopic scale. The second activity is to study the bulk phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), believed to be the correct theory of the Strong interaction between partons. This will be achieved by varying the conditions of the collision to lower energies, to probe the transition(s) between confined and deconfined matter. In particular, we plan to perform a novel analysis as a function of the collision energy, measuring coordinate-space anisotropies and dynamics. Thirdly, we will take the tools developed to study bulk physics in heavy ion collisions, and apply them to hadronic(p+p) collisions at similar energies. We will look particularly for collective behaviour(flow) in hadronic collisions. If our initial reports of such flow in ultrarelativistic p+p collisions are confirmed at higher energies, this raises important issues about the nature of flow, and the nature of the initial self-interacting state, itself. In the present grant ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions will be studied with Au-Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and with Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. RHIC started delivering Au-Au collisions in Summer 2000, and the LHC, which is the highest energy heavy ion accelerator now in operation, began delivering Pb-Pb collisions at the end of 2010. In order to look for signatures that a phase transition to Quark Matter has taken place, one must study the properties of the particles produced in the collisions, such as particle momenta and multiplicities of each type that can be detected (e.g. pions, kaons, protons, and more exotic particles). This will be done at both RHIC and the LHC using the large acceptance detectors available in the STAR and ALICE experiments, respectively, which can sample most of the interesting particles per collision. The information obtained in this way can be used to determine, for example, the physical size of the interaction region (using two-particle interferometry), the temperatures reached in the collisions (from particle momentum distributions) and exotic particle production such as strange baryons.<br/><br/>Besides the intellectual merit described above, there are broader impacts to society of this proposal in the areas of education, technology and computing. Since undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will play key roles in this project, training will be provided to these groups in how to carry out research in large collaborations and in general problem solving skills. Since this research requires large-scale computing in order to acquire and analyze data on the teraflop and terabyte scale, new methods in information science, such as computing grid systems, will be developed, which can enhance the computing power of society as a whole."

0.3,"Atomic nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons and exhibit a variety of shapes. Some nuclei are spherical, while others have non-spherical shapes (similar to an onion, a zucchini, or a pear); the shape of the nucleus is unique for each isotope of each element. Because we cannot take an ordinary photograph of the nucleus to investigate its shape and structure, other methods must be employed. Through reactions at the University of Kentucky particle accelerator, neutrons are produced and then scattered from the nucleus. In the process, the nucleus gains and subsequently releases energy that can be detected. This information is used to deduce the shape of the nucleus and to gain an understanding of how the neutrons and protons in the nucleus contribute to its properties. Graduates of this research program receive hands-on experience with particle accelerator operation, nuclear science instrumentation, radiation detection, and data acquisition systems, and emerge as well-trained nuclear scientists who are capable of important contributions to our national needs. <br/><br/><br/>The broad-based research program at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory includes studies in several forefront areas: nuclear structure relevant to neutrinoless double-beta decay; nuclei undergoing shape transitions; deformed structures and shape coexistence; nuclear structure contributions in support of searches for fundamental symmetries. In this research, the inelastic scattering of fast neutrons is used to examine low-energy collective nuclear excitations and to obtain information, e.g., level lifetimes and transition multipole mixing ratios for non-yrast states, which is inaccessible with other reactions. Detailed investigations of stable nuclei complement advances in nuclear structure achieved by studying nuclei at extreme conditions of temperature and angular momentum or in regions far from stability. Experimental innovations in the laboratory, e.g., the development of capabilities for measuring lifetimes in heavy nuclei, have played a key role in this research. These advances, coupled with the unique capabilities of this laboratory for the production of high-quality, time-bunched monoenergetic neutrons, probe important questions and make meaningful contributions to our knowledge of nuclear structure."
3.2,"Describing complex living systems in a quantitative, physically-based manner is extremely difficult. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers award the Center for the Physics of Living Cells (CPLC) brings experimentalists and theorists together to address the technical challenges at the interface of physics and biology specifically on the cellular level. By the development and deployment of novel techniques from experimental, theoretical, and computational physics, the CPLC will create a dynamic narrative of living cells, expanding the physical description from molecular scales to whole cells and multicellular collections. Exploring such topics as real-time molecular mechanics and the statistical physics of intermediate size systems will inform and advance areas in both biology and physics. CPLC activities will foster the training and development of multidisciplinary scientists at the junction of physics and biology, including ''bootcamps'' and summer school workshops for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. The CPLC will also operate diverse outreach programs targeting high school teachers and students, bilingual communities, and the general public.<br/><br/>The CPLC seeks to transform the understanding of how cells function from molecular to macroscopic scales, communicate, respond to external stimuli, and even evolve. These goals will be approached through a variety of research activities including the development of new biophysical techniques that can measure individual molecules and cells and observe how cells interact to create new phenomena. Another activity concerns the quantification of intracellular complexity, including the measurement of RNA and protein dynamics. Further investigations involve probing how the properties of multicellular systems arise from the interactions of single cells. Experimentalists and theorists at the CPLC will collaborate closely to develop novel multi-scale computational tools to simulate systems on a wide range of times, scales, and complexity.<br/><br/>This Physics Frontiers Centers award is co-funded by the Physics Frontiers Centers program in the Division of Physics and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry within the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences within the Directorate for Biological Sciences."

The goal of this project is to develop a set of general skeleton codes that can be used for experimentation, education, and for developing adaptable PIC software for next-generation many-core architectures. The activities supported here will focus on incorporating the best software practices into production codes for use on present and future high-performance computers, on experimenting with novel ideas for load balancing and tradeoffs in performance and accuracy, for analyzing and storing large data sets, and on developing ""desktop"" versions of PIC codes for use by a wide audience and broaden their impact. <br/><br/>This project will provide scientists with powerful simulation tools by tapping into the vast computing power of graphic cards commonly used for video games.

0.056087,"It is a well-known fact that light, stable nuclei, those with which we are most familiar, are made up of roughly equal numbers of protons and neutrons. This project will explore the structure of neutron-rich nuclei that are far from stability and consequently much less familiar. This will provide a vital understanding of the subtleties of the nuclear force in nuclei that can be found in explosive astrophysical environments, such as a supernova. These experiments will help us to understand the different abundances of the observed elements in the universe, in addition to engaging students in the study of these fundamental questions. In addition, the applied nuclear physics efforts at Hope College will use traditional accelerator techniques for the rapid testing of consumer goods and environmental samples containing chemicals of concern. Work on non-destructive characterization of automotive paint samples for forensic applications will continue. <br/><br/>Experiments producing unstable nuclei at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab (NSCL) (excited states of helium-9 and oxygen-26) will measure decay neutrons with the Modular Neutron Array, while emitted charged fragments are deflected with a high-field dipole magnet into timing and energy detectors. The properties of the decaying nucleus will be determined with invariant mass spectroscopy. Astrophysics measurements will also be done at the NSCL with the Summing NaI Detector supplemented with an internal beta detector or an internal gas cell constructed at Hope College. The interdisciplinary applied physics portion of the proposed research, done with the Hope accelerator, is principally based on particle induced gamma-ray emission, particle induced x-ray emission, and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy."
0.3,"This grant partially supports neutrino research at the University of South Carolina (USC). The group studies the properties of the neutrino, the most prolific particle in the universe, about which much is still unknown. The primary effort is the search for the hypothesized, but not yet discovered, nuclear-radioactive decay called zero-neutrino double-beta decay. The existence of such a radioactive decay mode has important consequences. Its existence requires that neutrinos have mass, and that they are their own anti-particles. Most importantly, this process would require the violation of an important fundamental conservation law of elementary particle physics. The USC group has leadership roles in two of the leading experiments in this field: the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, and the Cryogenic Underground Observatory (CUORE) in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy. The spin-off technology from the required radiopurity of materials for the ultra-low background detectors has transitioned directly into Homeland Security. Four past USC PhD students from the program hold important positions in Homeland Security, at the Pacific Northwest and Savannah River National Laboratories. <br/><br/><br/>CUORE, nearing completion in the LNGS, is an array of 988 tellurium oxide single-crystal bolometers that operate at ~8-10 mK to search for the zero-neutrino decay of tellurium-130 (Te-130); the detector will contain 200-kg of Te-130. The predicted half-life sensitivity is ~10^(26) years, to reach into the inverted hierarchy neutrino-mass region. USC leads part of the R&D to determine the feasibility and cost of enriching CUORE to 93% in Te-130 from 33.4%, and equipping the bolometers with Cherenkov-light detectors to discriminate against alpha-particle background. These upgrades are designed to reach the sensitivity required to cover the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. USC leads the CUORE data analysis to search for zero-neutrino double-beta decay of Te-130 to the first excited 0+ state in xenon-130, by detecting the coincidence events from the two electrons and cascade gamma rays. This technique achieved zero-background in the prototype experiment, CUORICINO. Finally, the USC group was responsible for the production of the CUORE front-end electronics, and will participate in its installation, commissioning and maintenance."

0.332036,"All astrophysical and cosmological data now point convincingly to a large component of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in the Universe, but a dark matter particle has yet to be directly detected. A well-motivated possible candidate is a light axion. Should axions constitute the dark matter of our Milky Way halo, they may be detected through their conversion into a narrow microwave signal by an apparatus consisting of a microwave cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. Using this concept the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) has performed a search for such axions within the mass range of a few micro-eV. Recently a smaller microwave cavity experiment was constructed called ADMX-HF (High Frequency), specifically to explore higher ranges of axion masses. ADMX-HF also serves as a test-bed for innovations in microwave cavity and amplifier technologies that could be migrated to the larger ADMX platform. ADMX-HF and ADMX operate as ""one experiment, two sites"", sharing expertise, technology, and data. This award will expand the collaboration to accelerate the construction of ADMX-HF as well as dramatically expand its initial capability.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: ADMX has proven to be a technology driver as components such as the SQUID amplifiers developed for ADMX are already being used for other purposes. Innovations to be developed by ADMX-HF have similarly broad potential.

0.486128,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this award is directed at the study of the quark structure of nucleons and the nuclei that are made up of these nucleons. Research will be carried out at the Fermilab Laboratory near Chicago as part of a collaboration called SeaQuest. This collaboration is focused on the production of pairs of particles called muons, which are like electrons but more massive, used as a probe of the anti-quark distributions in the nucleon (and whether these distributions are modified in nuclei). This information will provide direct input to theoretical models of the proton, and shed light on the origin of the proton's spin. A related study, using a polarized proton beam, will provide new information on symmetries of the quark distributions based on predictions from the fundamental theory of Quantum Chromodynamics. In addition, the Michigan group will lead the operation of the low-temperature hydrogen targets at the SeaQuest experiment, and participate in the development of a polarized hydrogen target for a next-generation experiment. Education and training of both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as outreach aimed at the general public, is an important aspect of this research program.<br/><br/>The SeaQuest experiment at the Fermilab Laboratory near Chicago will provide a better understanding how light anti-quarks are distributed in nucleons and nuclei, on the physical mechanism that generates the sea of the nucleon, and how orbital angular momentum might contribute to the nucleon spin. A smaller, but very important effort will be spent on developing a polarized Drell-Yan program at Fermilab that is complementary to the spin physics programs at Brookhaven National Lab and Jefferson Lab. This program builds on the expertise the group has gained, and is a natural extension of the group's work over the past years. It allows them to play a major role in the Drell-Yan experiment at Fermilab now, and to lead the way towards a polarized Drell-Yan program at Fermilab in the future."

0.204681,"Understanding the nature of gravity at microscopic distances is one of the most important open problems in fundamental physics. Although General Relativity provides an extremely well-tested framework for describing gravitational effects at large distances, it cannot provide consistently a description of gravity at small scales where quantum effects are prevalent. The development of a quantum theory of gravity is a central goal of fundamental physics, with broad implications for our understanding of particle physics and the mysterious nature of the ""dark energy"" that appears to permeate the universe. Many theories attempting to provide a consistent microscopic framework for gravity (e.g., those involving extra dimensions) predict that gravity could deviate from the familiar inverse square law at sub-millimeter distances. Such deviations are extremely difficult to measure experimentally due to the small strength of gravitational interactions at microscopic distances. This project represents an attempt to do this. At the same time, while the direct scientific goals of this program are clearly central to the development of modern physics, the general investigation of the technique should enrich many other fields of science and technology. The ability to trap and control small objects in vacuum using laser beams is being explored for applications in quantum control, quantum computing and in the general area of detection of small forces. In addition the work will require the detailed understanding of residual electromagnetic interactions between the microspheres and the materials composing the attractors, and it is conceivable that progress in this area may enable new techniques for measuring properties of surfaces that are not yet accessible by probes such as Atomic Force Microscopes. Finally, the students (graduate and undergraduate) exposed to the project will receive a very complete training in many areas of science and technology.<br/><br/>Previous measurements at these distance scales have employed techniques derived from human-size devices in which mechanical springs are used as force sensors. We propose in this project to develop a drastically new technique, using the light field of a laser to confine and measure the motion of micron (or, eventually, submicron) size quartz nanosphere. This technique takes advantage of the modern development of optical tweezers, which has produced significant advances in biology and polymer science. By confining the nanospheres in vacuum and cooling them to low temperatures through active feedback of the trapping laser, the nanospheres can be decoupled from the room temperature environment, significantly reducing thermal and vibrational noise sources. The nanosphere oscillates in the harmonic potential of the optical trap, and its interaction with attractor masses positioned several microns away can be measured by studying the motion of the microsphere. The use of a light field in lieu of a mechanical spring affords much greater flexibility. Backgrounds can be mitigated through careful selection of the materials used for the attractors and the coating of the attractors with appropriate shielding layers. We have already cooled 5 micro-meter diameter microspheres to mK temperatures and demonstrated force sensitivities of 10^-17 N/sqrt(Hz). We have recently published a paper in Phys Rev Lett showing that the nanospheres can be easily discharged and setting a new limit on the existence of particles with very small fractional charges. In the course of this project we expect to be able to study the Casimir effect and, in general, residual electromagnetic interactions between the nanospheres and the attractors and perform a first competitive gravity measurement."
205.12,"ABSTRACT<br/>Advanced LIGO MREFC Construction <br/><br/>Gravitational waves offer an unprecedented opportunity to see the universe from a new perspective, providing access to astrophysical insights that are available in no other way. Advanced LIGO?s (AdvLIGO) goal is to pioneer a new field of gravitational-wave astronomy. AdvLIGO is an upgrade to the initial Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors and will take place over FY 2008 ? FY 2015. LIGO was conceived as an infrastructure to support a series of improving instruments, and AdvLIGO will re-use the civil construction, vacuum equipment, and environmental monitoring system while replacing the detector components at the Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA observatory sites. The AdvLIGO design is the product of the LIGO Laboratory research and development program and the focused effort of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, informed by the experience from initial LIGO. The complete AdvLIGO detector consists of three interferometers: one 4-km instrument at the Livingston site, and two 4-km instruments at the Hanford site. The instruments are taken through integration and test, with the prime project objective met when each interferometer is capable of being brought reliably to an operational state (?locking?) for multi-hour periods. The Caltech-MIT LIGO Laboratory, with Caltech as the responsible fiduciary institution, will carry out the project. Other members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), on subcontract from Caltech/MIT, will participate in all phases of the effort. The UK (Science and Technology Facilities Council funding) and Germany (Max Planck Institute funding) are contributing significant capital equipment and manpower, complementing the NSF funding.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: AdvLIGO will increase the sensitivity over initial LIGO by more than a factor of 10, and thus the volume searched and potential rate of signals by a factor of more than 1000. The available bandwidth is larger, and the frequency response tunable, to address a range of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves. It is anticipated from current astrophysical knowledge that there will be frequent observations of gravitational waves, allowing a broad exploration of heretofore inaccessible astrophysics, cosmology, and relativity. Tests of general relativity in the strong field region near black holes will provide data that will help advance numerical relativity and gravitational theory. AdvLIGO will observe in coordination with other gravitational-wave detectors. The resulting observations will complement those from existing photon and neutrino observatories, increasing their reach, and giving new qualitative and quantitative understanding of the cosmos.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: AdvLIGO is the long-term focus of the entire LSC, including 46 institutions and roughly 600 members globally. In this light, implementing AdvLIGO will directly support a scientific community which came into being due to LIGO. In addition, LSC education and outreach activities of member institutions (including the LIGO Laboratory?s very active program) will be greatly enhanced by the onset of gravitational-wave astronomy -- and the new eye on the universe, achieved by pushing instrument science to fundamental limits, will inspire a generation of young people to consider the excitement of science and engineering as a career."
0.198241,"From the level of chemical reaction networks within cells to the social structures of higher organisms, biological systems seem to take advantage of distributed computation to perform a myriad of complex functions. However, rigorous quantification of how life stores, processes and propagates information at the various levels of organization observed in biological systems has remained elusive. In this project the PIs will utilize recently developed information-theoretic tools from complex systems research, typically applied to artificial life systems, to assess how a real biological system manages distributed information to perform a collective computational task. This research will provide new applications of mathematical and computational tools for use by scientists and will provide important insights in issues of broader concern such as colony collapse disorder observed in honeybees. The results will be disseminated to the general public through a variety of media as part of the outreach efforts of the PI and Co-Is. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs focus on characterizing information storage, processing, and propagation in colonial decision making as a rigorous case-study for understanding the physics of collective computation in living systems. The aim is to address several outstanding questions in insect behavior, by applying a novel theoretical framework treating collective decision making as a computation to the problem of collective nest site choice by the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. To this end, the investigators will implement a novel synthesis of two levels of theoretical investigation, agent-based modeling and information-theoretic analysis of experimental and simulated data sets, with experimental manipulation to determine the mechanisms of information processing among individuals that lead to global, emergent computation in Temnothorax rugatulus colonies. With this novel framework, the PIs will address several important outstanding questions about the physics governing collective choice, including the role of negative feedback and under what conditions collective wins over individual rationality. The research will provide one of the first detailed studies expanding the wealth of knowledge on emergent computation in complex systems to the biological realm. This study will inform our understanding of fundamental aspects of biological computation that will provide new perspectives on the physics of living systems by illuminating how life stores, processes, and propagates information. Due to the ease of manipulation of individuals within eusocial-insect societies, the PIs will be able to probe the minimal set of individual-level features necessary for spontaneous distributed computation."

This award supports two faculty in both of these efforts, each of whom will include undergraduate researchers in all aspects of the research.<br/><br/>Undergraduate students and faculty are investigating unstable neutron-rich nuclei to refine the theoretical understanding of light, neutron-rich nuclei. The group is measuring the excited states of 9He and the ground state of 13Be with the MoNA/LISA/Sweeper system at the NSCL.

0.49,"A very powerful laser can be used to accelerate electrons to high energies by interacting with a state of matter known as a plasma, an ionized gas of charged particles. The laser achieves this by creating waves in the plasma, like a boat pushing through water, on which the electrons can surf and be accelerated to high energies. In this specific project the pulse of laser light will be controlled and the structure of these waves mapped out in time and space, both with unprecedented precision. These techniques should help the development of compact particle accelerators. Accelerators represent a $3B per year market, but their overall impact is even greater since they find use in everything from cancer therapy to imaging stresses in aircraft wings. Thus, the development of compact and cheap accelerators is likely to have a significant impact both economically and technologically.<br/><br/>The research project will use the high repetition rate of the relativistic intensity (~10^19 W per square cm, 35 fs) laser, ""Lambda-cubed"", located on campus at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor to enable unique measurements of laser propagation and wakefield formation, to exert unprecedented control of laser wakefield acceleration, and to generate up to 10 MeV, few fs duration electron beams at 0.5 kHz. Stable, high quality relativistic electron beams at up to 10 MeV at 0.5 kHz repetition rate using the Lambda-cubed laser will be generated by making use of advances in pulse compression and feedback control made at the University of Michigan. A 5 fs pulse will be used as an ultrafast 4D probe of the plasma wakefield structure, allowing unique tomographic characterization of the accelerator structure."
0.144678,"The goal of this project is to study the ""Rydberg excitation blockade."" Atoms will be cooled to extremely low temperatures and put into high energy states called Rydberg states. In Rydberg states the outermost electron (or the negatively charged component of an atom) travels in extremely large orbits around the nucleus (or the core of an atom). Because of these large orbits, atoms in Rydberg states have properties which are exaggerated relative to the properties of atoms in their natural, or ground state. One such property is that Rydberg atoms interact strongly with each other when separated by large distances, even though they have no net charge. Normally, when a laser is shined on a group of atoms, the outermost electron in each atom is readily promoted to Rydberg states. However, the interactions among multiple Rydberg atoms causes this excitation to be suppressed, or ""blocked,"" and leads to the creation of fewer Rydberg atoms than would otherwise be created. This suppression of excitation may help enable the use of single atoms as the ""bits"" in computer (""neutral atom quantum computing""). Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize data security and encryption. The present project will focus on processes which make the Rydberg excitation blockade function less effectively (state-mixing interactions). Essentially, if one tries to put atoms into a given Rydberg state using a laser, the atoms will mix into other states. This mixing ""breaks the blockade"" and leads to an undesirably large number of Rydberg atoms. The goals of the present research are to quantify the extent to which state mixing interactions reduce the blockade efficiency, to understand the physical mechanism which gives rise to the mixing, and to study the experimental parameters which lead to the best excitation blockade. Understanding these issues will allow other researchers to use the blockade in a way that minimizes unwanted effects when developing a quantum computer. The project also involves a significant educational component. The PI will develop educational modules for a diverse group, ranging from general education students to advanced physics students. The PI will also study the impact of metacognitive exercises on problem solving performance in the introductory physics classroom. All work will be done at a primarily undergraduate university with a significant fraction of first-generation college students.<br/><br/>The Rydberg excitation blockade, a process whereby strong interactions among highly-excited atoms suppress laser excitation, has been at the heart of an array of recent experimental achievements. It has been suggested that state-mixing interactions, which result from couplings among multi-particle Rydberg states near a Förster resonance, may compromise the effectiveness of the excitation suppression under otherwise favorable conditions. Experimentally, however, the extent to which the blockade is compromised has been unknown, as large amounts of state mixing have always accompanied an improved blockade near resonance. In this project, the extent to which state-mixing reduces the blockade efficiency will be quantified using state-selective field ionization spectroscopy of rubidium Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap. This work will lead to a better understanding of the physical mechanism responsible for enhanced state-mixing. Additionally, the project will include a systematic study of the experimental conditions for the best blockade near a Förster resonance. The PI will design an eduational module on laser cooling and trapping for a general education course as well as an advanced laboratory experiment on characterizing an ultracold atom cloud in a magneto optical trap."

2.2382,"At the high energy frontier in particle physics there are several key, unanswered questions. As yet undiscovered, more massive particles could explain a number of these mysteries. For example, in the universe today, there is much more ordinary matter than antimatter. However, no mechanism of known particle interactions can explain how the universe evolved from the matter-antimatter balance at the time of the Big Bang to the present, highly unbalanced, situation. By making precision measurements, it is possible to detect the echoes of such massive particles, common at the time of the Big Bang, in quantities like the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which just reflects the separation of the neutron's composite positive and negative charges. In addition to advancing our knowledge in particle physics and cosmology, and generating technological progress, this experiment will involve post-doctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students as an essential part, affording the young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their education and training in a forefront area of nuclear physics.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) is an explicitly time-reversal-violating observable that has played an important role in descriptions of elementary particle physics; measured upper limits continue to limit extensions of prevailing models. For example, at present, supersymmetry (SUSY) predicts a value of roughly 10^-25 e-cm for a SUSY mass scale of 1 Teraelectronvolt and maximal mixing. It is clear that measurements at the scale of 10^-28 e-cm as proposed here will provide important input at combinations of very high mass scales and small mixing angles. The neutron EDM is also important for understanding the general pattern of T-(CP-) violation and the cause of the observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the universe.<br/><br/>This experiment, to be performed at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline of the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL, is based on a technique that is qualitatively different from the strategies adopted in previous measurements. The basic technique in the present experiment involves formation of a three-component fluid of polarized neutrons and Helium-3 atoms dissolved in a bath of superfluid Helium-4 at a temperature T ~ 0.5 K. The ultracold neutrons in this volume, trapped in a plastic measurement cell, are produced by the collision of 8.9 Ångstrom neutrons with the phonons of the superfluid. The neutron and Helium-3 magnetic dipoles precess in the plane perpendicular to an applied external magnetic field, B0 in a traditional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance arrangement. The nEDM, dn, is determined by measuring the neutron precession frequency in the presence of a strong electric field, E0. Application of the electric field parallel (antiparallel) to B0 changes the Larmor precession frequency, nu, in proportion to dn. With B0 = 30 milliGauss and E0 = 50 kiloVolt/cm, nu = 88 Hertz and the frequency shift is 4.8 nanoHertz for an EDM of 10^-28 e-cm. Operationally, the neutron precession frequency is measured relative to that of the Helium-3 by taking advantage of the strongly spin dependent nuclear capture reaction and detecting the recoiling proton and triton via scintillation produced in the liquid Helium-4. The polarized Helium-3 atoms (in the same volume as the neutrons) also comprise a co-magnetometer (since any EDM of the Helium-3 atoms is suppressed by its atomic electrons); their precession is observed directly using SQUIDS.<br/><br/>This project provides important training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs as they participate in forefront physics research that stretches across areas including low temperature, atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The results of the experiment potentially impact particle physics as well as astrophysics and cosmology. Some technological developments are expected as several SBIR and STTR grants related to the experimental apparatus have been awarded to date."

0.102723,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the mass of the Higgs boson has the value it has. To answer these questions it is necessary to go beyond the present picture of the Universe described by the Standard Model to the next phase of development, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Investigations in BSM physics probe such questions as why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. This project will focus on the study of the properties of special types of particles, mesons, whose nature can reveal information about fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The work in this award will use data collected at the Belle experiment at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) laboratory in Japan. Belle is built around the interaction region of an asymmetric electron-positron collider. The main goal of Belle is to detect particles made of a quark-anti-quark pair, so called mesons. In particular those mesons made of charm quarks (charmonium) and bottom quarks (bottomonium). These mesons are described in the SM by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). By studying these mesons, one can probe for BSM fundamental physics processes such as Charge Parity (CP) violation, rare meson decays and possible exotic particles which could indicate the presence of Dark Matter.<br/><br/>The Belle Experiment at KEK in Japan has the world's largest data samples recorded at the bottomonium resonances in the mass range of 10 GeV, the so-called Upsilon resonances. At these resonant energies the electron positron beam particles have a much higher probability of producing B mesons, allowing experimenters to acquire large statistics and observe rare phenomena . The central aim of this RUI program of research by the Luther College group is to study the spectroscopy of bottomonium and related states, with a focus on resonant states that probe the limits of our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and improving the theoretical understanding in lattice QCD (the techniques used to make computer predictions of QCD calculations). The Luther College program provides an unusual opportunity for undergraduate students to become meaningfully involved in a world-leading experiment, taking part in every aspect of Belle data analysis, and in the development of software tools for the upgraded experiment, Belle II."

However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. <br/><br/>But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Such measurements lie at the heart of this project.<br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which refines LArTPC technology, using a test beam and at the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL.<br/><br/>LArTPC detector technology is scalable to the very large masses (perhaps 10 kiloTons) needed by next generation neutrino experiments and is capable of recording three-dimensional digital images of particle trajectories. The MicroBooNE will have an active volume of 80 tons of liquid argon and 8256 wires spread over three instrumented wireplanes making up the Time Projection Chamber. MicroBooNE will make a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with the superior LArTPC, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this work will involve graduate students and undergraduates supported by this proposal receiving first-hand experience with High Energy Physics detector development, while also having access to MicroBooNE data that the graduate students will use for their dissertation analyses. The Syracuse group will continue with several outreach efforts as part of this proposal.

0.269,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Savdeep Sethi at the University of Chicago. <br/><br/>The origins of space and time are one of the enduring mysteries of nature. Did space and time emerge in some kind of Big Bang? Will the universe end in a Big Crunch? Can we sensibly describe these singular highly quantum states of nature? In order to answer such basic questions about the nature of space and time, we need a quantum theory of gravity. String theory remains the best candidate for such a theory. In his research, Professor Sethi aims to explore static and dynamical aspects of string theory and quantum field theory. The static aspects include new ways of curling up the extra dimensions of string theory to arrive at a four-dimensional universe. These new types of compactification are closely tied to the dynamics of chiral gauge theory in two dimensions. The dynamical aspects include the study of stringy domain walls. These walls are bubbles of inflating space-time, quite similar to the conventional branes of string theory, which offer the possibility of a holographic definition of quantum gravity in an accelerating universe. <br/><br/>This project is also expected to have significant broader impacts. Professor Sethi will involve graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in his research, thereby providing mentoring to junior physicists studying string theory and quantum field theory. He also intends to interact with high-school students and undergraduates through continued participation in the Chicago REU program and the Space Explorers inner-city K-12 enrichment program. The final aspect of the broader impacts comes from improved interdisciplinary ties with both cosmologists and mathematicians through lectures at schools and workshops, through direct collaboration, and by organizing workshops at the interface between these disciplines."
0.12,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Xingang Chen at the University of Texas at Dallas. In recent years, experiments and theoretical studies have established a six-parameter Standard Model for the Big Bang cosmology, and provided strong support for the existence of an inflationary epoch as the origin of Big Bang. The details of this epoch are now being explored. In addition, various tantalizing anomalies have been observed that can potentially provide us the knowledge beyond the Standard Model. This project will systematically study different beyond-Standard-Model signals in terms of both the theoretical model-building and the interpretation of data. The primary data comes from detailed studies of the cosmic microwave background(CMB) and of the large scale structure (LSS) of the universe. This research motivates new connections between theory and data, and facilitates discoveries of new physics.

Methods of model building, first-principle derivation and data analyses are combined to effectively carry out this program."
1.035,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
0.15,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Stephen P. Martin at Northern Illinois University. These research activities will advance our knowledge of how the basic building blocks of the universe interact. This includes study of the known fundamental subatomic particles, including the recently discovered Higgs boson. Martin will also investigate new theories that go beyond the known sub-atomic particles, including a possibility known as supersymmetry. The key prediction of supersymmetry is that for each of the known fundamental particle types, there must be a another type with very similar properties but much heavier particles than the presently known ones. Martin will work on strategies for discovering these new particles in experiments. Martin will mentor students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels on research methods, participate in education and training of high school teachers, and directly interact with pre-college students through local and regional science fair judging.<br/><br/>The proposed research will study the relations between observable quantities measured at colliders and the underlying parameters of the Standard Model, by performing relevant calculations in a more accurate and detailed approximation than ever before. These calculations, together with more accurate data on the Higgs boson that will be obtained by the Large Hadron Collider, will allow us to understand the dynamics of the Higgs field, and test the consistency of the minimal Standard Model of particle physics. Martin will study and improve formulas relating the Higgs boson mass to its self-interaction strength and its interactions with other particles. Martin will also continue to study supersymmetry, which now is significantly constrained, but certainly not ruled out, by Large Hadron Collider data. Martin will work on strategies for maximizing the experimental reach of the Large Hadron Collider for supersymmetric particles, by investigating novel signatures and areas of parameter space where discovery or exclusion will be particularly difficult or subtle. He also plans to investigate variations of the minimal supersymmetric theory that make distinctive predictions that can be experimentally tested if supersymmetric particles are discovered. Martin will develop more accurate calculations and tools that will aid in the interpretation and understanding of a future discovery of supersymmetry, by relating the masses and interactions of the new particles to the parameters of the underlying theory. This research will affect the interpretation of experiments at the CERN LHC proton-proton collider, and various dark matter detection experiments. These experiments are major science infrastructures, and employ many researchers and students at all levels in a variety of science and engineering fields."
0.21,"This award funds part of the research activity of Professor Savvas Koushiappas at Brown University. The main goal of this award is to unite theoretical studies of the physics of dark matter with current and future experimental efforts. The experimentally motivated theoretical projects use observations of high energy photons and other energetic particles such as positrons and neutrinos (into which dark matter might decay or annihilate) in order to tackle fundamental questions about the nature of dark matter, the origin of astrophysical backgrounds, the astrophysical effects of cosmology and most importantly the interplay and connections among these different topics. The primary goal is the interpretation of dark matter indirect detection search data in the context of dark matter properties and the implications for accelerator studies. A secondary goal is the understanding and improvement of systematic uncertainties that arise from astrophysical processes and the cosmological context. The outcome of this work will help understand the confidence at which theoretical dark matter interpretations can be ruled out from null searches, and to establish the confidence to which dark matter's physical properties can be measured in future experimental efforts.<br/><br/>Any dark matter experimental technique is ultimately linked to the details of the interplay between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. For example direct detection experiments depend on the local density and velocity distribution of dark matter, indirect detection experiments depend on the square of the dark matter density along a line of sight, and each of these techniques depends on the cross section of interactions and the mass of the dark matter particle, both of which are probed in accelerator searches. It is therefore imperative that theoretical interpretations of experimental results in the context of particle physics must take into account this amalgamation of information. This research will bridge the gap between these disciplines, making the connection between astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics possible by understanding the uncertainties and connections between different disciplines. These goals will be achieved by sophisticated theoretical modeling, and new and existing statistical and analysis tools. In addition, the broader impact pertains to the synergy between indirect detection, direct detection and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) searches, thus connecting the laboratory to the sky, a necessary link that must be in place for any convincing dark matter interpretation of any signal. Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate education at the PI's institution will benefit from the exposure to cosmology, particle physics and computing, as well as the development and implementation of new computational and analysis tools. And finally, the proposed outreach activities of the PI will allow the public and students within Providence to engage in science-related activities."
0.21,"This award supports the research of Professor Herbert Neuberger, from Rutgers University. The recent experimental discovery of a new particle (""Higgs"") at the Large Hadron Collider has firmly established a level of validity for the 50 years old theoretically constructed ""Standard Model"". Several theoretical concerns about the Higgs sector led many to develop theoretical alternatives involving new strong forces. While many of these new alternatives have been ruled out by the new discovery, several somewhat formal theoretical concerns remain. The award will support research on a reevaluation of the fundamental assumptions underlying the field theory that is the basis of the Standard Model, with the hope of tying together the observed Higgs sector to possible strong dynamics at higher energies, and will also study some other aspects of the Standard Model which never were under good theoretical control. <br/><br/>The main viewpoint of this work is to see how much flexibility there is in the restriction of imposing strict locality on the theory. Specifically, the question is whether it is mathematically possible to relax locality in such a manner that some of the above theoretical concerns would be eliminated. The Standard Model is classically conformal at high energies, and one wonders whether relaxing locality in a conformal theory can lead to a low energy theory that is non-conformal and local. This will be done by looking at simpler toy models in the hope that even simple mathematically well-defined systems could teach us something of ultimate value to the understanding Nature. The tools to be used will be computer simulation and expanding in a large number of colors."
0.4,"This CAREER grant supports the research of Professor Justin Khoury at the University of Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>As is now increasingly well understood, the energy density of the universe is dominated by contributions from a so-called ""dark sector"". As part of his research, Professor Khoury will explore the tantalizing prospect that the dark sector includes new light degrees of freedom that mediate long-range forces on cosmological scales, affecting both dark and baryonic matter. To ensure consistency with laboratory and solar system tests of gravity, some screening mechanism is necessary to ""hide"" these degrees of freedom locally. Professor Khoury therefore aims to probe the theoretical underpinnings of this idea, and fully develop the observational implications of existing screening theories. He also aims to devise novel screening mechanisms within the framework of consistent effective field theories. Professor Khoury will also study a new cosmological framework which he recently developed which might eliminate the need for an early inflationary period of cosmological evolution. This framework, which he calls the ""pseudo-conformal universe"", provides alternate solutions for many of the classic problems that are also solved by inflation.<br/><br/>Professor Khoury's activities are also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Khoury will design a freshman seminar for non-science majors, with invited guest lecturers from a new public lecture series hosted jointly by the Center for Particle Cosmology, Penn's Women Studies, and Penn Women's Center. The lecture series will contribute to broader representation of women in science by featuring leading women physicists. Professor Khoury will also build on the series of regular joint workshops he has helped established with Columbia, NYU, and Princeton in order to develop multi-institutional collaborations."
0.059844,"This award will enable collaborative work by Duke University and the University of Minnesota Duluth's neutrino research groups on the Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO). This is a new experiment designed to detect neutrinos originating in a core-collapse supernova within our own galaxy. The deaths of massive stars which cause these cataclysmic events occur every few decades somewhere in the MilkyWay and emit 99% of their energy in the form of a short burst of neutrinos. Existing detectors are primarily sensitive to electron antineutrinos. Use of lead for its target nuclei allows HALO to be sensitive to electron neutrinos, as well as to all flavor components of the burst flux via neutral current interactions. The effort for this funding cycle will center on upgrading HALO with redundant, fast-failover data acquisition systems. This award will provide modest hardware and personnel contributions to this effort.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this award include the excellent experimental training for students and postdoctoral researchers. They have been very successful in involving students and postdocs in the past. This project offers a range of experiences, from simulation through detector construction, with operations and data analysis to commence soon. HALO will also be a contributor to SNEWS (SuperNova Early Warning System), which has an intrinsic outreach component."
0.368939,"The Holometer experiment at Fermilab is designed to study a conjectured effect called ""holographic noise"" that may arise from new Planck scale physics: the measured positions of bodies may wander randomly from the geodesics of classical relativity, in measurement-dependent directions by about a Planck length per Planck time. The experiment will search for this holographic jitter in the relation of mass energy and space time by looking for correlated phase noise between two neighboring interferometers to provide convincing evidence for or against the hypothesized effect. A positive result would be a major step forward in understanding the emergence of space-time and mass-energy from a unified theory of gravity, space-time and quantum mechanics. A negative result will impact the macroscopic interpretation of unified theories.<br/><br/>This award will enable the PI to collaborate in the search for Holographic Planck Scale Noise. The experiment, under construction and testing at Fermilab, will search for the correlation of the two noise signals from two nearby simple Michelson Interferometers. This correlated noise should depend on the relative displacement and orientation of the two interferometers, thus making incisive tests possible. This experiment will be the first targeted specifically to measure this fundamental minimum interval of space-time. It could make the first direct measurement of a universal noise in space-time caused by that fundamental Planck scale graininess.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Apart from the possibly very significant impact on physics and the way space-time is viewed, even a negative result would provide strong graduate physics training and an excellent career launching experience. This experiment is a good hands-on physics project, with multiple opportunities for real mentor contact, and with the experimental reality of debugging, diagnosing and making measurements; the PI has a strong personal outreach program to undergraduates and has mentored undergraduates in summer research projects for more than 10 years."
0.277284,"This award will provide support for a group with one PI, a postdoc and two graduate students to work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC is a large, complex machine that accelerates protons to unprecedented energies, allowing for discovery of elementary particles more massive than any yet observed. One of the LHC's primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for much of the interactions of particles forming the visible matter in the universe. Though doubts linger, many physicists believe the new particle is the Higgs Boson long predicted by the SM. Nevertheless, more careful measurements of its rarer decay modes need to be made. Surprises are possible, and could result from effects beyond the SM that are yet to be discovered. This project will focus on efforts to do this by looking at events that pair a Higgs boson with another particle. Searches for extremely rare processes as will be sought in this effort require the use of sophisticated software and computing tools, modern machine learning techniques, data mining and the use of complex statistical tool kits. These skills are useful not only in particle physics and other STEM fields, but also outside of academia and the research world as companies, non-profits and governmental organizations across the country look to the large data sets newly available from social media and computing databases to provide better products and more useful services to customers and<br/>citizens.<br/><br/>The proposal supports work to be done in Run2. This is about to begin at the full energy potential of the LHC of 13 TeV, almost twice that in Run1 and twice the energy ever studied with precision before. This group will focus on events with a Higgs Boson accompanied by either a t quark, a t-tbar pair or another Higgs. The PI has expertise in such analyses in Run1 that may allow him some advantage in dealing with different conditions likely to occur in Run2. The group will be working on the ATLAS fast tracker (FTK) that will allow new triggers that might allow the events of interest to be found more efficiently."
0.188989,"In recent years, various inventions and innovations have made it possible to produce dilute gases of atoms at extremely low temperature, essentially the coldest matter in the known Universe. By reducing the temperature of these gases, one reduces their disorder, allowing for two exciting scientific prospects. First, the low disorder implies that measurements made on conditions that effect the atomic gas--such as electric and magnetic field, or acceleration and rotation--will have very little noise, allowing for more precise measurements. Second, the atomic gas can be manipulated in a way that the interactions between atoms in the gas is similar to the interactions between electrons in a solid material. Through such mimicry, one can investigate properties that materials have been predicted to exhibit, but that have been obscured due to the excess disorder and temperature of real materials. This project promotes the progress of science and technology by advancing toward both these prospects. The principal and co-investigator, along with graduate students and postdocs, will develop techniques that allow for precise measurements with and of atomic gases. The researchers will also investigate properties of atomic gases that mimic the magnetic properties of complex materials, contributing in general to the understanding of magnetism in materials and devices that underlie so much of today's (and tomorrow's) information technology. The central involvement of young scientists in this work, including several from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in the physical sciences, directly contributions toward the training of a diverse scientific workforce in the United States.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project focuses on the behavior of cold gases of rubidium and potassium atoms that move within the spatially periodic intensity pattern generated at the intersection of several coherent beams of light. The optical pattern generates a spatially periodic potential that resembles the crystal potential in which electrons move in solid-state materials. The optical configuration can be rapidly tuned, resulting in various dynamics within the atomic gas. Such dynamics, which are the subject of the present investigation, allow for coherent control of atomic motion within the optical potential (relevant to precision measurements through matter-wave interferometry) and also reveal properties of materials in which the crystal structure tends to inhibit order and transport (geometric frustration, relevant to materials science). To improve one's ability to measure such dynamics, this project also investigates how methods of computational imaging (the improvement of imaging through computational methods) may be imported to the study of atomic gases. Finally, spin dynamics are used as a tool to measure how atoms diffuse within complex optical potentials, through an adaptation of methods used in magnetic resonance imaging, and also to isolate the effects of geometric frustration on atomic motion."
0.13,"The research funded by this award is designed to promote a better understanding of atomic nuclei, the basic building blocks of all normal matter in the Universe. How did they form following the Big Bang, and how do they now interact to change their basic elemental nature? Are there new forms of matter made up from very exotic types of atomic nuclei and how might we make and study these? To this end the group will develop special new techniques in nuclear science, as well as train future scientists that can help answer some of these questions. One important training component will be a continuation of the well-established and highly successful outreach to faculty and students at New Buffalo High School in Michigan that has introduced these students to interesting, important, and exciting careers in the sciences. The technology developed and used in this research will have applications in other important areas, such as homeland security (nuclear terrorism), the safe storage and monitoring of nuclear wastes, and applications in nuclear medicine, including radiation therapy. The latter includes a new modality directly related to this research: the production and imaging of ion beams to treat particular forms of cancer tumors. Nearly 50% of graduate students and other personnel trained in the group's past research projects are currently pursuing careers in nuclear security or nuclear medicine, and it is anticipated that this will continue as a result of the present grant.<br/><br/>The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing stable as well as short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies. This includes use of the TwinSol low-energy radioactive ion-beam facility in operation at the University of Notre Dame (ND), developed jointly by the University of Michigan (UM) and ND. Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability to elucidate the effect that the exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier. Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity to the continuum is the characteristic defining feature of weakly-bound systems. These studies will be carried out at TwinSol in collaboration with a group from the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), utilizing a prototype active-target time-projection chamber (AT-TPC). A related program will use the full AT-TPC recently commissioned at the reaccelerated beam facility (ReA3) at NSCL. <br/><br/>In addition, the UM-UND collaboration, under the primary direction of the UM research group and their colleagues, will continue advanced development and application of deuterated scintillators for nuclear measurements involving neutrons. This will include selected measurements of (d,n) and (3He,n) reactions involving both stable and unstable beams, and in particular 7Be(d,n) which is of interest in astrophysics. Since these detectors permit neutron spectroscopy and cross section measurements without neutron time-of-flight, they have a particular advantage when used with the high-intensity, low-energy, non-pulsed accelerators suitable for nuclear astrophysics measurements. The latter includes the new 5 MV accelerator recently installed at ND and we will pursue such experiments, and in particular several key (A,n) measurements, together with the nuclear astrophysics group at ND. <br/><br/>The unique neutron detector array the group has recently developed has potential for wide-spread applications both in nuclear science as well as in homeland-security and nuclear non-proliferation. As in the past, the proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from ND and UM, together with faculty members and students from several primarily undergraduate schools located in close proximity to these universities. The highly-technical nature of the proposed research will thus contribute significantly to the training of a technically-literate work force."
0.36,"This grant supports research to complete the determination of the weak charge of the proton and investigate new aspects of the Standard Model of fundamental matter and interactions. The Standard Model describes three of the four forces of nature in an elegant manner; those three forces are the electromagnetic interaction, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction. The weak charge of the proton is a basic property, like its electric charge and mass, which determines the proton's response to the weak interaction. It is also related to how the weak and electromagnetic interactions mix with each other. Because the Standard Model predicts how that mixing varies with the amount of momentum that is exchanged in an interaction, a precise measurement of the proton's weak charge at a low value of momentum transfer is a rigorous test of the Standard Model. Additionally, it is sensitive to physics not yet included in the Standard Model. The research program of this award also includes measurements of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering that is sensitive to charge symmetry breaking at the quark level and further extends our understanding of<br/>fundamental interactions.<br/><br/>The research group supported by this grant will re-commission the Mott polarimeter at Jefferson Lab. That polarimeter will measure the alignment of electron spins in the electron beam of Jefferson Lab; knowing that alignment is crucial to providing polarized electron beams to the four experimental halls of the Lab. Both hardware and software issues will be addressed in this project so the student and postdoctoral researchers will gain a wide range of valuable skills. These broader impacts on the polarized program of Jefferson Lab and the training of young scientists are interwoven into the research program."
0.01,"A fundamental goal of subatomic physics is the precise determination of the physical properties of subatomic particles such as the proton and neutron. The radius of the proton is one of these properties. The radius can be measured by scattering electrons, or heavier particles called muons, off protons. Another technique is to measure the energy levels of hydrogen, an atom consisting of a proton plus an electron, or muonic hydrogen, an atom consisting of a proton with the electron replaced by a muon. To date, the radius has been measured by scattering of electrons off protons, and by the energy levels of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. The proton radius derived from the measurement of the energy levels in muonic hydrogen disagrees with the radius derived from the measurements of the energy levels in hydrogen, and with the measurements of the proton radius by scattering of electrons, an issue known as ""the proton radius puzzle."" The discrepancy has attracted wide attention, because it may indicate the existence of previously unobserved and unexpected differences between the interactions of muons and electrons. <br/><br/>A dedicated MUon proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE), which will run at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland and directly compare the scattering of muons and electrons from protons, is highly anticipated by experts in the field for its potential to resolve the puzzle. This project will cover the prototyping and development of several crucial components of the MUSE experiment detectors. The project will involve the training of students and young scientists, at the undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and junior faculty levels. The institutions involved in the project have trained large numbers of students of each type, including from minority populations. The training they have received in the process of doing basic research has led to careers in a variety of areas, from medical physics to national security, in addition to continued work in fundamental physics research. The MUSE experiment will broaden the perspective of American students by having them work in an international collaboration at an international laboratory, which will prepare them effectively to become prominent global scientists of the next generation. With the broad interest in the proton radius puzzle, MUSE has the potential to be broadly inspirational beyond the current scientific community."

The outreach component of this award will establish a pathway for students at nearby community colleges to learn about and become part of the PI's research group. This project will also increase science literacy through the development and dissemination of educational materials for learning gravitational-wave science in the undergraduate curriculum.<br/><br/>Albert Einstein predicted gravitational waves in his 1916 theory of general relativity.

This award supports research to thoroughly characterize the LIGO detectors - work essential for the detection of gravitational waves. In addition, it supports research on optical scatter aimed at assessing and improving the quality of commercial optics that will be required to extend the astrophysical reach of future gravitational-wave detectors. These projects provide increased opportunities for students to participate in cutting-edge research at CSUF, a primarily undergraduate and Hispanic-serving institution.

0.420497,"In this project, the PI will model the entire healthy red blood cell (RBC) by introducing a coarse-grain molecular dynamics (CGMD) using a two-component membrane model for normal RBCs. The model will fully count for both the membrane skeleton and the phospholipid bilayer. The model will be expanded to simulate the entire healthy RBC. The characteristics of a quiescent healthy RBC, including its biconcave shape and material properties, will be obtained. In addition the PI will model sickle RBCs by creating a CGMD model for polymerized deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) fibers and show how the interaction between HbS fibers and the membrane results to the biomechanical properties and to the variety of shapes of sickle RBCs via deformation, membrane loss and dehydration. The PI will also experimentally validate the model by employong AFM to measure local and average force displacement responses for normal and sickle RBCs from which the stiffness will be obtained. The average and local loss and storage moduli of normal and sickle RBCs will also be measured via active microrheology experiments. Simultaneously, the amount and the domains of polymerized HbS will be determined via an optical microscopy technique in the same cells where the mechanical properties are measured. The results of the CGMD simulations will be compared with the proposed single cell experiments to validate the model parameters. The outreach activities will promote engineering and science in high school teachers and students and in particular they will advance the participation of high school girls in science and technology. The educational program will promote the involvement of minority students in engineering and it will increase the interest of students in the multidisciplinary field of cell mechanics. The computational tools, the experimental setup, and the protocols will be available via a freely accessible website."
16,"The basic idea of Grid Computing is to utilize available CPU cycles and storage of many computer systems across a worldwide network so that they can function as a flexible, pervasive, and inexpensive accessible pool that could be harnessed by an individual, accredited user, similar to the way power companies and their users share the electrical grid. Grid computing can be viewed as a service for sharing computer power and data storage capacity over the Internet, simply and transparently, without having to consider where the computational facilities are located.<br/><br/>Experiments at major centralized experimental facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) require large amounts of computation and storage and involve hundreds of experimenters using computational facilities all over the world. These features are well suited to the capabilities of grid computing. Grid computing developments occurred in parallel to the development of the LHC experiments. The Open Science Grid (OSG) is the major facilitator of Grid Computing in the U.S. Researchers subsequently developed these ideas in many other exciting ways, producing for example, in addition to OSG, large-scale federated systems (TeraGrid, EGEE, Earth System Grid) that provide not just computing power, but also data and software on demand. Standards organizations then developed relevant standards that led to possible interoperability of Grids. Grids define and provide a set of standard protocols, middleware, toolkits, and services built on top of these protocols. Interoperability and security are the primary concerns for the Grid infrastructure as resources may come from different administrative domains, which have both global and local usage policies, different hardware and software configurations and platforms, and vary in availability and capacity.<br/><br/>The Open Science Grid is a distributed computing infrastructure for large-scale scientific research. The OSG contributes to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid as the shared distributed computing facility used by the US ATLAS and US CMS experiments. The OSG is built and operated by a consortium of 90 U.S. universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations and software developers. It is supported by the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy Office of Science. The OSG supports not only physics experiments but also researchers from other fields, including astrophysics, bioinformatics and computer science. Currently the OSG has more than 60 sites in the US and five sites in Brazil, Taiwan and Mexico, supported by the host countries.<br/><br/>All LHC computing and storage sites in the US are members of the OSG and allow other scientific collaborations using the OSG to opportunistically use available resources. The OSG collaborates with the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE project in Europe to provide interoperating federated infrastructures which can be used transparently by the LHC experiments' software. The Large Hadron Collider, located 330 feet below the border of Switzer¬land and France, is the world's most powerful particle accelerator. Its very-high-energy particle collisions may yield extraordinary discoveries about the nature of the physical universe. Beyond revealing a new world of unknown particles, the LHC experiments could explain why those particles exist and behave as they do. The LHC experiments could uncover the origins of mass, shed light on dark matter, expose hidden symmetries of the universe, and possibly find extra dimensions of space. <br/><br/>The LHC accelerates hair-thin beams of particles to a whisker below the speed of light. Thousands of powerful superconducting magnets steer the beams around the LHC's 16.5-mile-long ring. At four points the particles collide in the hearts of the main experiments, known by their acronyms: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. In the data from these high-energy collisions scientists search for the tracks of particles whose existence could transform our understanding of the universe. More than 10,000 scientists, engineers and students from almost 60 nations on six continents contribute to the LHC, which is headquartered at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. About 1,700 come from universities and laboratories in the United States. Federal funding for US contributions to the LHC is provided by the US Department of Energy's Office of Science and the National Science Foundation."

0.4,"Understanding systems of interacting particles is one of the key challenges of physics, and has both fundamental and technological relevance. Such systems generally cannot be fully described in closed analytical form (mathematical expressions that can be written down) for more than two particles, even if their individual properties and the forces between them are precisely known. This dilemma is well-known as the ""few-body problem"" and it limits the extent to which one can predict the states of the particles (e.g. their positions and velocities) for any time in the future. Therefore, advancing the knowledge of phenomena that emerge due to the complex interplay of several particles requires the joined theoretical and experimental exploration for a wide range of situations. In this project, few-body phenomena of quantum systems consisting of atoms, their electrically charged components (electrons and ions), and photons (the particles of light) will be studied. Such quantum systems represent an ideal testing ground of few-body physics for multiple reasons: First, few-body effects in these systems are ubiquitous and relevant to many research fields and numerous technical applications, particularly in areas such as materials science, quantum chemistry, biological science, and information processing. Second, advanced experimental techniques are available which allow manipulation of the parameters of the few-particle quantum state with a high degree of control and accuracy. Moreover, modern spectrometers enable snapshots to be taken of the state's change over time, allowing details of the state's dynamics to be analyzed. Techniques for the control of atomic few-body systems and for the analysis of their dynamics which have been developed in the past twenty years (largely independently of each other) will be combined in the present project for the first time. This will enable the observation of few-body quantum phenomena while being able to tune the system parameters, and it will allow benchmarking theoretical models.<br/><br/>On a more technical level, this project involves the control and analysis of atomic few-body systems using laser cooling and manipulation techniques to prepare a large variety of initial states, ranging from single excited or polarized lithium atoms to large ensembles of atoms that are cooled to quantum-degeneracy. Systems of only very few atoms can be confined in a micrometer-sized optical dipole trap and their interaction can be tuned close to Feshbach resonances. For the analysis, a ""reaction microscope"" will be employed allowing the coincident measurements of the momentum vectors of atomic fragments after ionization of the lithium atoms by femtosecond or attosecond laser pulses. In essence, there are three fundamental questions to be addressed in the proposed experiments: First, how do the ionization dynamics depend on the relative orientation (or helicity) of an ionizing laser field and a polarized target atom? Such experiments will help to understand fundamental symmetries and ultimately control the interaction of laser fields with chiral (atomic or molecular) targets, which play a crucial role e.g. in biochemistry. Second, how is the disintegration of an atom due to the interaction with an ionizing field influenced by its environment? This is experimentally only studied for clusters or solid targets, but largely unexplored for more dilute systems. Apart from the fundamental importance of this question, the dependence of the ionization dynamics on the environment is relevant to the understanding of the damage of biological tissue due to radiation. Finally, how does the correlated wave function of a few-particle system change as a function of the particle number and interaction type and strength? The possibility to ""engineer"" simple few-body systems and observe such systems comprehensively would allow one to ""simulate"" and understand fundamental quantum phenomena that occur in natural or artificial materials."

Laser plasmas, therefore, are of interest for a number of applications including ignition. We will develop the basic plasma science to provide tailored laser pulse schemes for ignition and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) applications. In terms of combustion, laser ignition has many potential benefits. For reciprocating natural gas engines one can ignite leaner mixtures (reducing NOx emissions and pollutant formation) and higher pressure mixtures (leading to higher engine efficiencies and fuel-savings). In aerospace applications one can achieve better relight in aero-turbines. The multi-pulse approaches may lower the burden on required laser sources and fiber delivery implementations. We will present our activities to local minority-serving public schools (K-12) and include research advances in courses at our universities. We will specifically target underrepresented or minority groups to work on the project as their Ph.D. thesis research.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The proposed research focuses on innovative approaches employing pre-ionizing pulses (ns-ps-fs) to enhance and control laser plasma formation in gases. In particular, we will examine cases in which an initial pulse is used to achieve pre-ionization, and is followed by a second pulse that provides controllable energy addition. The energy addition of the second pulse is enabled by pre-ionization due to the first pulse. The result will be a laser plasma that is not at full breakdown conditions (i.e. no spark), but that has elevated temperature (>~2000 K). Such laser plasmas can provide novel and improved ignition sources by avoiding the unnecessarily high temperatures, strong shock waves, and elevated laser pulse energies that accompany full laser breakdown (sparks). We will consider a range of pulse durations (ns-ps-fs) as well as both non-resonant and resonant schemes for pre-ionization. We will also study both non-resonant pre-ionizing pulses as well as Resonant Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) schemes. The REMPI schemes will be developed for future applications in air with initial studies in synthetic gas mixtures, e.g. we will study REMPI of argon and oxygen which are abundant in air. The plasmas will be experimentally studied and characterized as well as modeled numerically. We will determine optimal laser pulse parameters (wavelength, duration, temporal separation etc.) to provide sufficient pre-ionization and to allow subsequent energy addition. Owing to the lack of visible emission, the study of such plasmas is challenging and a key feature of our proposal is the use of a newly developed microwave scattering technique to measure electron parameters. The proposed research will be transformative in terms of laser plasma formation; despite a large body of research in laser breakdown using single laser pulses there has been minimal research on multi-pulse approaches and pre-ionization. The three-year program will be conducted by Colorado State University (CSU), University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK), and Princeton University (PU) and combines experimental studies, advanced diagnostics, and computational plasma and combustion modeling."
0.14004,"This project explores the possibility of using laser light to reduce the temperature of a gas composed of electrons and charged atoms (a so-called ""neutral plasma""). The charged atoms (ions) and electrons exert electrical forces on each other. In ordinary plasmas, the ions and electrons move quickly and only push on each other briefly as they rapidly pass one another. When the plasma temperature falls, the amount of time charged particles spend near each other increases and the influence of the electrical force becomes more pronounced. At low enough temperatures, the gaseous plasma assumes characteristics of dense liquids. Interestingly, fusion-class plasmas (extremely hot plasmas that are being studied for their potential as an advanced source of electrical power production) also behave as dense liquids. This happens not because of low temperature, but because of high density. The degree to which a plasma behaves as a dense liquid is given by a mathematical quotient of the plasma density divided by the temperature. In fusion plasmas, this quotient is large because of high density. In the proposed experiments, this quotient is large because of low temperature. This makes it possible for the proposed experiments to study the physics of fusion-class plasmas using a model system at low temperatures with exquisite control over experimental conditions. Activities funded by this proposal will explore the limits of low temperatures in ultracold plasmas. Brigham Young University, where this research will be carried out, sponsors one of the largest undergraduate physics programs in the nation. Because several undergraduate students will be involved in this work, NSF funding will directly influence their scientific education and preparation.<br/><br/>The strong coupling parameter, gamma, is limited in ultracold neutral plasmas by the process of disorder-induced heating (DIH). The cold ions are created by photo-ionizing laser-cooled Ca atoms in a magneto-optical trap. Although cold, these ions have an overwhelmingly large electrical potential energy. The ions are accelerated as they move to minimize their potential energy. The Ca ion temperature increases from a few mK to a few kelvin, a factor of 1000 in less than 100 ns. Kinetic and thermodynamic plasma properties scale with gamma. Unfortunately, DIH limits gamma to be less than 2 in neutral plasmas. The goal of this research, therefore, is to reduce the ion temperature in ultracold neutral plasmas using laser cooling, increasing the value of gamma. This proposal builds on extensive previous work by Dr. Bergeson in this field. Successful realization of this goal will generate a platform from which high-gamma experiments can be performed in the future. The ions will be cooled using a powerful frequency-broadened laser at 397 nm. The optical leak in the cooling transition to the 3d doublet D (J=3/2) level will be plugged using lasers at 850 and 854 nm. Repumping coherences will be avoided by alternately switching these near-infrared laser intensities. After a specified cooling time, the cooling light will be switched off and the ion temperature will be probed by scanning a low-intensity laser across the 397 nm absorption line profile, collecting the laser-induced fluorescence, and fitting the measured lineshape to a Voigt profile. One challenge in this project is using optical forces to overcome the electron-driven radial plasma expansion. Simulations suggest that this is possible. Another challenge will be to scatter photons from the plasma ions fast enough that the ions can be slowed and confined before velocity-changing collisions redistribute the ion kinetic energy to untrapped portions of the ensemble. Numerical estimates suggest that this should be possible at low plasma densities."
0.359958,"This award provides support for an experimental research program to study quantum matter in a table-top setting using the precise tools of atomic physics. Collections of atoms will be cooled to about one-billionth of room temperature and confined in electromagnetic traps in order to isolate its quantum properties. Studies of interactions between atoms at the few-particle and many-particle level will be carried out using mixtures of lithium and ytterbium atoms. These studies will probe the fundamental yet complex three-body problem, which abounds at all length scales from atomic binding to celestial mechanics. Additionally, experiments with atoms trapped in optical lattice geometries will be carried out, shedding light on condensed matter phenomena such as phase transitions and pattern formation.<br/><br/>Concurrent with the research component, related education and outreach will be actively performed. Graduate and undergraduate students will gain valuable research experience in the course of the project, preparing them to join the work force in academics and industry as the next generation of scientists and engineers.

0.383353,"Gravitational wave astrophysics is entering a new era of discovery and exploration, with first detections expected within the next few years with Advanced LIGO, the ground-based interferometer in the United States. One of the key missions of LIGO is to test Einstein's theory of General Relativity where it has never been tested before: where the gravitational force is enormous relative to Earth's or the Sun's pull. Such a task is achievable because gravitational waves encode information about this force when black holes and neutron stars collide in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. This project has 2 main goals: (i) to calculate accurate waveforms that aid in the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals and (ii) to develop the best, generic and model-independent framework to test Einstein's theory and search for anomalous deviations in gravitational wave data. <br/><br/>The research described above is creative and potentially transformative, constituting one of the first dedicated efforts to test Einstein's theory with gravitational waves, an essential step to exploit the full potential of gravitational wave detection. This type of research is also timely and relevant, in view of upcoming, advanced detectors and the dawn of gravitational wave astrophysics. The impact of gravitational waves signaling a systematic departure from Einstein's predictions is clearly breathtaking. But the lack of a departure from Einstein's theory would also constitute a huge step for Science, proving for once and for all that Einstein's theory is also valid in the most extreme gravitational scenarios. We also have an ambitious outreach plan that includes the organization of ""Celebrating Einstein"": an immersive art exhibit that incorporates gravitational waves sounds and simulations, orchestra and dance performances, and a scientific workshop. There will be accompanying talks for the public and lectures for local middle school students. Another outreach initiative is the creation of a ""Cosmic Café"" in Bozeman, Montana, that will reagularly organize activities such as Jeopardy-type contests about Physics."
0.308991,"Numerical studies of non-abelian gauge theories coupled to fermions in different representations of the gauge group will form the central focus of all projects in this proposal. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) belongs to the class of theories we will investigate. The aim is to understand confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, the two features that help understand mass generation and much of the low energy non-perturbative aspects of these theories. We will consider the SU(N) gauge group and consider the limit of a large number of colors (N). We will couple the gauge theory to quarks in the adjoint representation. Using a phenomenon called reduction, we will be able to numerically study the theory on a single site lattice with the number of quark flavors extended to take on any real value. This will enable us to study conformal and near-conformal theories and help us understand mass generation. The de-confinement transition in QCD is currently under intense experimental investigation and we will study the role of baryonic chemical potential in the large-N limit of QCD. Two-dimensional fermion will be used as a probe to study the strong to weak coupling transition in the large N limit of QCD-like theories. We will study the effect of quark masses in multi-favor QCD and, in particular, consider the case of negative quark masses with the aim of identifying a curve in the space of mass parameters where one has massless pions. <br/><br/><br/>Quarks carry a color charge and nuclear matter is formed from the binding of colored quarks mediated by gluons. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory that describes the interaction of these color charges. Experiments have shown that quarks come in three colors but all nuclear matter is color neutral. Massless quarks and gluons give rise to nuclear matter that has mass. An understanding of this mass generation is of fundamental importance and this project will address various approaches to this problem by focusing on QCD-like theories in the limit of large number of colors. Such theories are closely related to recent developments in string theory and we will be able to make connections between field theory and string theory. The scientific methods involve analytical calculations and numerical computations. A post-doctoral fellow with prior experience in this area during his/her recent graduate work will be mentored by the PI to work on several aspects of the proposal. Computer clusters will be used for numerical computations and the results obtained as part of this proposal will be presented at international conferences in nuclear and particle physics."
0.301286,"This project addresses current issues of interest concerning the structure of the Universe. The investigator and his students will focus on the study of matter in compact stars, as natural laboratories that provide extreme densities and strong magnetic fields. One of the important components of the project concerns the training of graduate and undergraduate students by involving them into a modern research program in theoretical nuclear physics. The students are expected to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills that will be applied in their future careers in industry or academia. The integration of the principle investigator's research with education at the Arizona State University with a substantial enrollment of underrepresented groups of students will contribute to a high-quality education in science and engineering, as well as to the development of human resources in the region.<br/><br/>This project will apply quantum field theoretical methods to study fundamental properties of relativistic matter in magnetic fields. The corresponding relativistic types of matter with strong magnetic fields are relevant for the phenomenology of compact stars, the evolution of the Early Universe, and the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions. Therefore, the project will add to a deeper understanding of numerous phenomena in the natural world and will expand the knowledge about the phases of strongly interacting matter and their role in the cosmos. The theoretical methods and research outcomes of this project will also extend beyond the realm of theoretical nuclear physics. In particular, the results of these studies will be useful in the context of quasi-relativistic condensed matter materials, which hold a great promise for future applications."
0.31279,"The National Nuclear Physics Summer School, held annually since 1988, is an effort by the nuclear physics community to acquaint students with the forefront issues of the field and with the experimental and theoretical tools that are available to nuclear physics researchers.

Typically most of the field's major directions are represented in the lectures: hot and cold nuclear matter, electromagnetic physics, weak interactions, astrophysics, and nuclear structure. Advanced graduate students and beginning postdoctoral researchers are the target audience. School organizers are charged with identifying outstanding lecturers from theory and experiment, conducting the school in a manner that encourages discussion and interaction, and developing supporting materials, including an online archive of lectures that can serve as a long-term reference for participating students and for others who are interested in the current status of nuclear physics. School organizers are assisted by the Principal Investigators and by a Steering Committee appointed by the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society.<br/><br/>The school is often the first opportunity for students to recognize the breadth of nuclear physics and to interact across subfields. Thus, it plays an important role in building a nuclear physics community. Student morale is enhanced by this opportunity and by the chance to meet with some of the field's leading researchers. The school allows students from under-represented groups to network with their peers. Students leave the school with stronger backgrounds in nuclear physics, and with new knowledge of their chosen specialties. As the lectures are preserved in an on-line archive, the students can return to this material when a need arises during their subsequent training and research. Students are given a chance to present talks and thus to gain experience in making presentations to a diverse audience."

0.025,"This award funds the research of Professor Joel W. Walker at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.<br/><br/>Research activities are to include the phenomenological investigation of topics broadly related to the subject of ""supersymmetry"", as well as the engineering and distribution of original software tools enhancing the productivity and efficiency of this and related studies. Supersymmetry is an idea that may protect the relatively light mass of the Higgs Boson observed by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 from drifting to a much heavier value. It works by hypothesizing the existence of a new class of particles whose interactions would naturally cancel the destabilizing effects of the known particles. These supersymmetric particles simultaneously provide a suitable candidate for the cosmological ""dark matter"" and are themselves a primary target for discovery in collisions at the LHC. Efforts to clarify the role of supersymmetry in low energy physics, and the search for new fundamental particles and interactions, benefit the national interest in advancing basic scientific knowledge. Sam Houston State University is a primarily undergraduate institution that takes pride in its proportional over-representation of female, minority, and low-income students. Specific activities will be designated for undergraduate participation that are sufficiently narrow and systematic in scope for students to productively engage at an early juncture, even as they are becoming more widely educated. This real-world research exposure offers broader impacts on self-confidence, team integration, algorithmic problem solving, and systematic handling of data, while enhancing the likelihood of transitioning a successful high-energy physics graduate student. <br/><br/>More technically, specific topics itemized for investigation include experimental signatures of novel supersymmetric mass hierarchies, isolation of distinctive decay modes such as long-chain cascades, contemporary applications of collider discriminants such as a boosted event topology, methods for probing the spin composition of dark matter, and the phenomenology of well motivated alternatives to the minimal supersymmetric picture such as string-derived large volume scenarios and decays of the higgsino to the singlino dark matter candidate in the NMSSM. A key methodology employed in the prior will be the numerical generation and analysis of Monte Carlo collider data simulations. Support for these objectives will also be rendered by the authoring, documentation, and dissemination of programs useful to similarly interested researchers, e.g. for safe, fast computation of the asymmetric 2-step MT2 event statistic, and for the expeditious selection, optimization, analysis, and visualization of simulated collider event data."

0.05,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Ali Chamseddine at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon.<br/><br/>The quest for unification of fundamental physical interactions has been the subject of intensive research for nearly forty years. The stumbling block in this program is the inclusion of the gravitational force among the other three forces mediating the strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions. These latter forces are very well understood in the framework of quantum field theory. In contrast, the gravitational force, because of its extreme weakness, is sizable only for macroscopic objects and is therefore mainly understood only at the classical level. Professor Chamseddine's research focuses on the development of a quantum theory of gravity. As such, research in this area promotes the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this work will also contribute to the advancement of knowledge in high-energy physics, gravitational physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Moreover, this project is envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The American University of Beirut (AUB) plays a very important role in promoting the American educational system in the Middle East. The recent launching of the Ph.D. program in theoretical physics is a step towards the promotion of high-level research in the Middle East, and is attracting students of high caliber.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Chamseddine will conduct research investigations in supergravity, grand unified models, quantum gravity, string theory and noncommutative geometry.

In addition, he will study physical applications and dynamical realizations of this quantization scheme."
0.15,"The most challenging problem in theoretical physics is the unification of the laws of quantum physics with Einstein's general theory of relativity. The ideas in this direction that have been pursued most forcefully are superstring theory and noncommutative geometry. These two approaches are intimately related. Noncommutative geometry has provided a new framework to study spaces which could not be handled by the standard methods of Riemannian geometry. It offered a new perspective in the study of gauge theories and the role of the Higgs field and is a promising candidate to describe geometries at Planckian energies. In the past years it has been established that space-time is approximated by a well defined product of a continuous four-dimensional manifold by a finite dimensional space. The main focus of this program is to construct a genuinely noncommutative finite dimensional space valid at sub-planckian scales and whose limit at lower energies is the noncommutative space of the standard model. The geometry will be reduced to those of almost commuting matrices, and it will be possible to get a handle on quantizing the geometry. It will also study new asymptotic limits of the spectral action as well as cosmological implications. Other parts of this project will study various aspects of gravity such as stability of BPS monopoles, and formulation of consistent massive theories of gravity, implications of the presence of right-handed neutrinos on the geometry of spacetime, the behavior of spectral actions in the presence of singularities and non-perturbative evolution of the dynamical fields at scales of the order of the Planck length. <br/>Broader impact of Project: Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this work which involves research on the frontiers of noncommutative geometry, will be of benefit to both physicists and mathematicians. The new ideas and methods in this proposal will contribute to the knowledge of the high energy theory and phenomenology, quantum gravity and mathematics communities, and to a lesser extent to the astro-physics community. The American University of Beirut (AUB) plays a very important role in promoting the American educational system in the Middle East. Historically, the emphasis was on liberal education.

2.2,"Gravitational waves were predicted almost 100 years ago in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, but they have not yet been detected due to the extreme sensitivity required. Examples of potential sources include interacting black holes, coalescing compact binary stellar systems, stellar collapses, and pulsars. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) was built to measure strains in the fabric of space-time that are produced by gravitational waves. However, the initial version was sensitive enough to see only a short way into the Cosmos. With completion of a recent upgrade, Advanced LIGO will soon become operational with ten times the sensitivity of LIGO. When it reaches design sensitivity, it should be able to detect gravity wave sources as far away as the Virgo cluster of galaxies and launch gravitational wave astronomy as a new window on the Universe. Stanford has a strong, multidisciplinary program in developing the technology for detectors such as LIGO. Participants include mechanical, electrical and control engineers, physicists and materials researchers. The program provides training for future scientists and engineers at both the undergraduate and graduate levels; it integrates basic scientific research with scientific education; and it develops and funds outreach programs that inform and educate the broader community.<br/><br/>Stanford is engaged in research and development on gravitational wave detection for the LIGO program. Improved seismic isolation and alignment system platforms will be developed to enable higher sensitivity at low frequencies where ground vibrations currently limit sensitivity. Studies of the optics will remain an active area of research to reduce noise from thermally-driven mechanical fluctuations in their amorphous optical coatings, which is now predicted to limit the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO in its most sensitive frequency band around 1000 Hz. Investigations of the atomic structure of the amorphous coatings will focus on a better understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that cause mechanical loss, which results in excess thermal noise. The thrust of the proposed research is to reduce risk and facilitate the success of Advanced LIGO, and to enable an opening of gravitational wave astronomy."

Expanding plasmas are common in nature, such as the atmosphere of the Sun, and in 21st century technology, such as in some rocket engines and industrial systems. This project explores the stability and the detailed structure of the ion acceleration process in hopes of developing a better understanding of the most important processes responsible for the ion acceleration.<br/><br/>The group will measure the stability thresholds for spontaneously forming double layers (sheaths) in expanding single and multiple ion species plasmas; the effects of neutral density in the double layer region on double layer structure and stability; and the spatial structure and plasma parameter dependence of the electric fields in the expansion region that result in the formation of multiple ion beams. Integrated with these investigations is the application of new diagnostic tools for the measurement of densities and flows of ions and neutrals in low temperature plasmas. The formation and stability of double layers in single-ion and multi-ion plasmas is a fundamental plasma physics question with important ramifications for systems ranging from space plasmas to plasma thrusters. Beyond the scientific contributions that this research will make to our understanding of double layer formation and stability, the broader impact of the work involves the training of graduate students in a research environment that emphasizes the synergy between basic and applied plasma physics; improvement of the percentage of women and minorities obtaining advanced degrees in physics; attracting high quality undergraduates into physics through involvement in cutting-edge research activities; and support of a STEM education initiative that extends to over half the counties in West Virginia and that is continuing to expand."

This new and transparent sharing of data promises significant scientific advances: Data from individual facilities that in isolation cannot be interpreted as the detection of an astrophysical source, may achieve a higher level of significance in a joint coincident analysis of data from multiple participating observatories. Each candidate astrophysical signal will be packaged as an electronic AMON Alert and distributed to a network of follow-up facilities for counterpart searches and characterization. Identification of an x-ray, optical, or radio counterpart will serve to confirm the astrophysical nature of an event and enable a broad range of detailed studies, including distance or redshift measurement, using traditional astronomical techniques."

0.527073,"Ultra-High Energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos (above 10^18 electron-Volts) would be the most distant and energetic particles that can be observed on earth, and well motivated models put them within reach of currently funded experiments. The Intellectual Merit portion of this award is organized around two concepts: <br/>1. Achieving the Best Sensitivity for UHE Neutrino Observatories; and <br/>2. Cornering UHE Neutrinos and Exploiting their Astrophysics and Particle Physics Potential. <br/><br/>The key elements of this award are based on two experiments representing the discovery and exploitation phases of the field: ANITA, an Antarctic, balloon-borne experiment with its third flight approved, and ARA, an in-ice array being deployed near the South Pole. ARA aims to exploit radio Cherenkov emissions (Askaryan effect). Connolly will expand the potential of searches for UHE neutrinos through a broad program that is carried out through simulations, instrumentation, data analysis, and optimization of event selection at every stage, including both hardware and software activities:<br/> 1. Simulation development focused on making simulations part of the data framework and using data to calibrate the simulations. <br/>2. Improved sensitivity of experiments due to novel new trigger designs optimized with her simulations. <br/>3. Developing instrumentation to improve sensitivities and characterizing system components for simulations and analysis. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The award will also fund an outreach program that bridges the established middle school GRASP (Girls Reaching to Achieve in Sports and Physics) summer science camp with the undergraduate program in the department. The new program is called BRIDGES (Bringing together Research, Ideas and Data for Girls to Excel in Science). Many programs aim to keep middle school aged girls (grades 6-8) interested in math and science, and a few universities, including OSU, run summer science camps for girls targeting that precise age range. Few if any such programs follow up with a program aimed at maintaining their interest in science throughout their high school years and into college. The new BRIDGES program will pique the interest of female high school students in physics by introducing them to current research and giving them hands-on experiences and mentoring them during this important phase."
0.438254,"In this project the PI will (1) to extend the concept of electrical restitution to the case of real physiological stimulation by mimicking HRV, and (2) to determine the effect of feedback modulation on the transition from normal to abnormal cardiac rhythms in the heart. The main hypothesis is that modulation and elimination of feedback leads to the stabilization of normal sinus rhythm, and therefore prevents abnormal rhythm formation in the heart. The revised concept of electrical restitution will be more accurate in predicting the transition to arrhythmias in the heart. Specifically, the PI proposes: (1) to develop a novel restitution concept by including a physiological HRV, and to test predictions of this new concept in isolated cardiac myocytes; (2) to validate predictions of the novel restitution concept in cardiac tissue using both numerical simulations of physiological ionic models and whole heart optical mapping experiments; and (3) to demonstrate the beneficial effect of feedback modulation on abnormal rhythm development using an in-vivo rat model. The proposed program will train graduate and undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary environment, and will expose students to nonlinear ways of thinking. The proposed activities will help students gain the ability to use nonlinear analyses to understand complexities in engineering and biological systems. The proposed research is designed to allow maximum use of combined numerical simulations and experimental approaches. Different levels of numerical simulations and experimental techniques will help train students in various areas, and encourage them to work as a team to accomplish the general objectives of the grant. As a part of educational program, the PI will develop a new course suitable for graduate and undergraduate students from the College of Science and Engineering to enhance their exposure to nonlinear dynamics. This course will describe the dynamics of the heart based on a multi-level approach, from single ionic current to isolated cardiac myocytes to the whole heart. The results of the research program will be used to promote ?hand-on? learning through demonstration and laboratory experiments. With the help of graduate and undergraduate students, the PI will design a Summer Lab course on cardiac electrophysiology to help students gasp several techniques, including optical imaging, data acquisition, nonlinear signal analysis, and feedback control. During next several years, the PI will organize an educational summer camp on cardiac dynamics adapted for high-school students, in which both lectures and lab course will be adapted for their needs."
0.502,"Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.<br/><br/>This award enables the group to address the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce; increased participation of women and minorities; improved teacher development; improved undergraduate education; increased public scientific literacy; and public well-being. The work has valuable spin-offs from the research, including reactor flux studies relevant to reactor monitoring and the cyclotron development relevant to medical isotope production. <br/><br/>The group is motivated by searches for new physics manifested in the neutrino sector. ""New physics"" means a step beyond the discoveries of neutrino mass and three-active-flavor mixing, which are well established. Introducing sterile neutrinos extends the number of mass states and expands the mixing matrix. This can lead to oscillations with squared mass splittings that are anomalously large. The group will pursue this question in two projects, the ongoing IceCube experiment and the future IsoDAR experiment."
0.46247,"Gamma-ray astronomy impacts a broad range of key science questions: indirect dark matter detection and tests of fundamental physical laws; cosmological studies; jet physics associated with active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and microquasars; and particle acceleration in galactic tevatrons and pevatrons. Today, extremely sensitive instruments operate in the high energy (AGILE and FERMI in the range 100 MegaelectronVolt (MeV) - 100 GigaelectronVolt (GeV)) and very high energy (VHE) (HAWC, HESS, MAGIC, VERITAS at energies greater than 100 GeV;) regimes simultaneously. Among the most exciting results from VERITAS are the detection of emission from the Crab Pulsar above 100 GeV (requiring the presence of a new emission component), the discovery of gamma-ray emission from a starburst galaxy, M82 (firmly associating cosmic-ray acceleration with star-forming regions), and the detection of correlated variability in the radio and Teraelectronvolt (TeV) regimes in radio galaxies (helping to constrain the emission to be originating within the jet collimation region). The upper limit on the gamma-ray emission from the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy set by VERITAS rules out most of the leptophilic dark matter parameter space favored by recent cosmic-ray positron measurements. A major upgrade to the VERITAS cameras during summer 2012 introduced high-quantum-efficiency photo multiplier tubes to lower the energy threshold of the array by 30%, and the array will be further augmented by the arrival in 2015 of a prototype 10 meter class Schwarzschild-Couder telescope under development for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). <br/><br/>Following the recent VERITAS hardware upgrade, great promise for further improving the science potential of the instrument comes from a focus on data analysis. This CAREER award provides support for developing major improvements in VERITAS data analysis methods aimed at lowering the analysis threshold, improving angular and energy resolution, and increasing background discrimination. It will also support analysis of VERITAS data to search for dark matter signals from the Galactic Halo, Fermi unassociated sources, and related targets, as well as studies of Galactic accelerators of cosmic rays. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The science of VERITAS and CTA - searching for dark matter and investigating the most powerful cosmic accelerators - has broad applications to both astro- and particle physics, and addresses questions that can capture the public's imagination. Group members will share that excitement via public lectures at area high schools and to groups in the local Morningside Heights and Harlem areas of Manhattan and Westchester County, and by engaging undergraduates and area high school students in the group's research activities. As a centerpiece to tie together these outreach activities, the group plans to develop a Visitor Center at Nevis Labs that will occupy both physical and virtual spaces and provide a focal point for visiting groups to learn about the history and current research at Nevis."
0.88,"This project supports research in gravitational physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Many of the deepest problems in theoretical physics revolve around combining Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum theory. The resulting theory is called ""quantum gravity"" and is needed to better understand the origin of the universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, and what happens inside black holes. The research supported by this award will use the latest techniques and tools to try to answer some of these fundamental problems. An essential part of this project is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the knowledge and techniques that are central to understanding and discovery in gravitational physics. Through a range of forums from public lectures, to informing media reporters, the Principal Investigators will disseminate the directions and results of their research to a broad audience. Society at large will benefit by increasing their understanding of science and the world they live in.<br/><br/>James Hartle will continue exploring the interface between quantum mechanics and cosmology. He will work on extending the predictions of the no-boundary quantum state of the universe for observations today to increasingly general and detailed situations. He will further develop the generalizations of quantum mechanics that are necessary for cosmology and investigate cosmologically motivated extensions of quantum mechanics. He proposes to continue to refine our understanding of the origin of the quasiclassical realm of every day experience as an emergent feature of our quantum universe. Gary Horowitz will investigate physics near cosmological singularities in holographic theories of quantum gravity. These are theories in which quantum gravitational degrees of freedom are equivalently described by a lower dimensional nongravitational theory. Horowitz will also explore connections between gravity and condensed matter that can arise using a classical limit of holography. This provides a new tool for the study of superconductivity and other phenomena. In addition, Horowitz will investigate aspects of higher dimensional black holes. Don Marolf will explore a variety of issues in classical and quantum gravity related to black holes, thermodynamics, and entropy. One is to extend arguments that black holes are thermodynamic systems to more general situations. Another is to investigate the possibility that the area of more general surfaces in spacetime might also be associated with entropy, and that spacetime itself may exist only due to thermodynamic phenomena. A final part of his work will continue to study implications of a quantum-mechanical phenomenon (the so-called Hawking effect) that causes black holes to slowly evaporate and which may require significant changes in our understanding of fundamental physics. The methods employed for all this work will be primarily analytic, though it will be supplemented with numerical calculations on desktop computers."
0.0695,"A fundamental goal of subatomic physics is the precise determination of the physical properties of subatomic particles such as the proton and neutron. The radius of the proton is one of these properties. The radius can be measured by scattering electrons, or heavier particles called muons, off protons. Another technique is to measure the energy levels of hydrogen, an atom consisting of a proton plus an electron, or muonic hydrogen, an atom consisting of a proton with the electron replaced by a muon. To date, the radius has been measured by scattering of electrons off protons, and by the energy levels of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. The proton radius derived from the measurement of the energy levels in muonic hydrogen disagrees with the radius derived from the measurements of the energy levels in hydrogen, and with the measurements of the proton radius by scattering of electrons, an issue known as ""the proton radius puzzle."" The discrepancy has attracted wide attention, because it may indicate the existence of previously unobserved and unexpected differences between the interactions of muons and electrons. <br/><br/>A dedicated MUon proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE), which will run at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland and directly compare the scattering of muons and electrons from protons, is highly anticipated by experts in the field for its potential to resolve the puzzle. This project will cover the prototyping and development of several crucial components of the MUSE experiment detectors. The project will involve the training of students and young scientists, at the undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and junior faculty levels. The institutions involved in the project have trained large numbers of students of each type, including from minority populations. The training they have received in the process of doing basic research has led to careers in a variety of areas, from medical physics to national security, in addition to continued work in fundamental physics research. The MUSE experiment will broaden the perspective of American students by having them work in an international collaboration at an international laboratory, which will prepare them effectively to become prominent global scientists of the next generation. With the broad interest in the proton radius puzzle, MUSE has the potential to be broadly inspirational beyond the current scientific community."
0.15,"Most nuclei are unstable and have limited lifetimes. Understanding the structure of nuclei far from stability and defining the limits of the heaviest elements has been an exciting challenge and has led to the production of nuclei with as many as 118 protons using both hot and cold fusion techniques as well as radioactive beams. This award will use the multi-nucleon transfer technique to synthesize new actinide nuclei. The investigators will also measure the properties and production mechanisms of the heaviest nuclei to understand the nature and behavior of these nuclei, and to assist theoretical predictions for the stability, structure and production of super-heavy elements. The project will contribute to the education of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. The training of scientists in nuclear and radiochemistry fulfills a well-articulated, frequently stated national need, the re-vitalization of nuclear and radiochemistry.<br/><br/>There are three phases of the research: (a) to investigate the use of multi-nucleon transfer (MNT) reactions in the region near 208Pb to test models of these reactions and to make new nuclei. These investigations are to be done with thick target experiments at Gammasphere (136Xe + 208Pb and 136Xe, 238U + 198Pt). In the former experiment, one is making a unique rigorous test of the Zagrebaev and Greiner formalism for treating MNT reactions while the latter reactions deal with the best way to make N=126 nuclei (b) to study the production of lower Z actinide nuclei testing current models of MNT. This will involve the identification of 15-30 alpha-emitting nuclear products from the 132Xe + 233U reaction by in-beam spectroscopy and off-line analysis and a study of similar products from the 192Os + 197Au reaction and (c) to study the production of exotic neutron-rich actinide nuclei at the limits of stability using transfer reactions such as 136Xe+ 248Cm and 232Th + 248Cm. Several new n-rich isotopes of Fm, Cm, and Cf will be produced."

2.13,"Overview<br/>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM).<br/><br/>The LHC is the premier High Energy Physics particle accelerator in the world and is currently operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. It is one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions.<br/><br/>LHCb is the first experiment designed specifically to study the decays of hadrons containing b or c quarks at a hadron collider. The goal of LHCb is to identify new physics in nature by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. New physics, or new forces, are manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered, these particles would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries, and thus allow new phenomena to be observed indirectly. In direct searches for new particles, the accelerator's energy must be high enough to allow the particle to be produced. In indirect searches effects of new particles can be seen even if they have a much higher mass than can be seen directly, because the effects are quantum in nature, and appear in Feynman diagrams where the particles are ""virtual"", so they are emitted and absorbed over short times. LHCb has operated very successfully starting in late 2010. The data are being analyzed and published. The experiment has shown many results, but none so far have clearly demonstrated new physics. LHCb has proposed an upgrade to be completed in the 2018-2019 time-frame when the LHC accelerator will not be running. This upgrade will allow LHCb to collect an order of magnitude more data in decay modes that will either show new physics or severely restrict the allowed mass range. LHCb is comprised of about 10 different sub-detectors or sub-systems. The Syracuse group has the responsibility of upgrading a part of the charged particle tracking system currently called the ""TT."" The intent is to significantly enhance the capabilities of this system above and beyond the requirement that data can be taken at an order of magnitude higher luminosity.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The intellectual merit of this award lies in the leading role the Syracuse group plays in the physics analysis that it is part of LHCb. This analysis sheds light on important aspects of our understanding of the Standard Model, including Charge Parity asymmetry which could explain the preponderance of matter in the universe as opposed to antimatter. In addition, the upgraded LHCb detector will allow a much more sensitive search for BSM physics. The main deliverable will be a new inner tracking device, the UT. This device will increase the data throughput over the current tracking device by an order of magnitude, allowing the LHCb experiment to probe BSM physics. The UT, which replaces the current tracker, will consists of four planes of single-sided 250-micron-thick silicon strip detectors, read out by a custom-made front-end electronic integrated circuit. With its reduced material budget and optimized segmentation as a function of the distance from the beam line, it plays a crucial role in reducing the rate of fake tracks and in providing fast momentum measurements in the residual field of the dipole magnet. <br/>The broader impacts of this work span several areas. Undergraduate and graduate students will be direct participants in the construction and testing of the detector that will be constructed. For many years a steady stream of undergraduates have been working in the PIs laboratories, where it is a tradition to ensure that graduate students have both hardware experience as well as data analysis capabilities. The upgrade work will be integrated into the Syracuse Quarknet program to involve high school teachers and some of their better students as well. Test results from this detector will be discussed at conferences and published. This detector is an integral part of the LHCb Upgrade and is essential for LHCb to continue to produce cutting edge physics results."

It is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering these Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson. One of the primary functions of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC is to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work carried out within this project will focus on the analysis of data from the CMS experiment looking for signals of beyond the Standard Model physics. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>Some of the search targets are mentioned in this paragraph. A discovery of leptoquarks would provide a link between the quark sector and the lepton sectors and help to explain why both sectors contain three generations of matter. Detection of substantial invisible decays of the Higgs boson would answer important questions about the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. Invisible decays of the Higgs are a signature of various beyond the standard model physics theories. In these, the Higgs can interact with new heavy particles which decay into particles that are usually not detected by the experiment (like neutrinos). Limits on the invisible decay rate of the Higgs boson also provide constraints on models of Dark Matter. The proposed studies also include measurements of the differential cross section measurements of Standard Model processes, such as ZZ production, and W+jets production, that have sensitivity to new physics. These studies are tightly coupled with the new physics searches because the processes they measure are important backgrounds to the specific searches targeted. The presence of a signal in any of these channels would have profound impact on our understanding of particle physics, while establishing its absence would provide important constraints on models of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>With the strong cooperative education program at Northeastern University, the group will continue to routinely involve undergraduates in meaningful six-month projects at CERN. The PIs will also continue their involvement with the Boston Area QuarkNet group (now in its 14th year) where they are able to reach out to local high school teachers and their students. The group members also share the excitement and knowledge of the discoveries and results with the broader public through lectures and presentations to audiences outside of particle physics."

0.180579,"In the last decades, astrophysicists and astronomers have studied the Universe for clues about what causes some of the most energetic transient events. It has long been thought that truly extreme objects such as black holes and neutron stars are responsible. Advanced instruments spanning the electromagnetic spectrum have provided a wealth of information regarding the transient Universe; however, many observations are unable to directly probe the dynamics of the systems in question. General relativity provides a way to map out the dynamics of massive, dense objects from a distance by encoding the motion as ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves. The principal investigator of this project will lead an effort within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to detect transient gravitational waves from the merger of black holes and neutron stars in real-time, enabling prompt multi-wavelength follow-up observations that can shed new light onto the origin of transients. Discoveries will be relayed to a network of follow-up observatories so that scientists can learn as much as possible about these events before they fade away. This research will increase understanding of the fundamental nature of space, time and the properties of exotic states of matter and energy that are not accessible to Earth-based laboratories.<br/><br/>The LIGO Collaboration has built highly sensitive laser interferometric gravitational wave receivers in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA that will measure to extra-galactic distances the minute oscillations of space-time caused by, for example, the merger of two neutron stars. Data from these observatories will be streamed in real-time to supercomputing facilities across the U.S where thousands of computing nodes will integrate millions of unique physical models of black hole and neutron star systems, known as templates, with the data in real time. Advanced signal processing techniques and software co-developed by the PI will infer the presence of a signal from any of the models within seconds of the signal arriving at Earth. Requiring signals to be observed simultaneously in multiple geographically separated gravitational wave detectors will allow the position of the source to be localized as well as provide confidence that the signal is not of terrestrial origin. The best-fit parameters and estimate of the event significance will be ingested into the gravitational-wave candidate event database where alerts to external partners will be issued as well as real-time correlation with external triggers such as gamma-ray bursts through the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN)."

0.370277,"Very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics has been transformed by a number of stunning discoveries made by the current-generation, ground-based gamma-ray observatories operating in the 100 GeV - 10 TeV energy range. These observatories are arrays of 2-4 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that detect VHE gamma-rays via Cherenkov light from secondary electrons in electromagnetic cascades initiated by gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Developing new instruments with significantly better sensitivity is not possible by a simple replication or upgrade of existing devices. <br/><br/>With this award, the proponents will build a novel gamma-ray telescope that has the potential to transform the field, based on work by Schwarzschild and Couder. It incorporates original ideas for the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments. The international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is preparing for a future IACT array with ten times better sensitivity and broader energy coverage to exploit the evident scientific potential of VHE gamma-ray observations. Some examples of new types of gamma-ray discoveries are searching extremely deeply for dark matter in the Galactic center and halo, testing cosmology with extragalactic background light measurements, resolving the details of shock acceleration in supernova remnants and pulsar winds, and advancing the physics of extragalactic jets by population studies and observations of short-term variability.<br/><br/>This new telescope overcomes the fundamental limitations in angular resolution and field of view of current prime-focus IACTs. At the same time, it allows the application of new, lower-cost technologies for the camera focal plane sensors. This work will demonstrate the enhanced performance and improved reliability of the SCT design, and the location adjacent to VERITAS will allow the performance to be evaluated against an instrument of known sensitivity. The results from this effort will enable informed choices to be made for the construction of CTA or other future instruments. It will also enhance the capabilities of the VERITAS Observatory.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Working with industry, this work will foster emerging technologies for the mass production of relatively inexpensive, light, aspheric mirror segments that will both enable future instruments to deliver unique science capabilities and encourage use of the design in the other fields of astronomy. This project will provide a unique opportunity for integrated research and education for a substantial number of young scientists."
0.3,"The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. Along with these tremendous advances in instrumentation, it has been known from the very inception of the gravitational wave physics effort that the envelope of statistical data analysis techniques must also be pushed further to enable the detection of weak and rare signals embedded in noise. It is in this area that the research funded by this grant will make significant contributions. By supporting graduate students, this grant will help to grow the community of researchers in this field. Since the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) is an Hispanic serving institution, the research activities will expose students who are traditionally under-represented in STEM areas to forefront science. Ongoing major education and outreach activities at UTB will leverage these activities to create awareness among high-school students about exciting projects such as LIGO.<br/><br/>This grant supports research projects in the following major data analysis areas. (i) An algorithm will be developed and implemented that allows the construction of sky maps of an anisotropic background of stochastic gravitational waves with minimal prior assumptions. Using methods originally developed in the context of pulsar-timing-based gravitational-wave searches, the new approach will vastly extend the capabilities of existing model-dependent searches. A Bayesian alternative to the standard frequentist stochastic search will also be developed that will leverage existing code for Bayesian inference in the context of detector characterization and noise estimation. (ii) A smoothness-regularization-based coherent network analysis method will be implemented that significantly improves the detection and characterization of burst gravitational wave signals having non-compact time-frequency (TF) signatures. Such signals are expected to arise in a variety of astrophysical scenarios but are known to pose a significant challenge to existing methods. (iii) A new method, derived from the Harmonic Regeneration Noise Reduction (HRNR) technique developed in acoustical signal processing, will be integrated with existing network analysis pipelines to boost their sensitivity to post-core-bounce-phase supernova signals. By improving both signal waveform and sky location estimation, this will lead to better multi-messenger follow up of such a rare but dramatic event. (iv) The characterization of detector noise and non-gravitational wave signals (""glitches"") in the data is necessary for improving detection confidence for genuine gravitational-wave signals. In this context, the Self Organizing Map (SOM) method will be used for instrumental glitch classification, and glitch characteristics relevant to aLIGO will be catalogued. An independent approach will use the BayesWave Bayesian inference pipeline to identify and study glitch signals."

0.276233,"The objective of this project is to acquire a cutting-edge commercial multi-functional Integrated Fluorescence/Atomic Force Microscope (IF-AFM) to support fundamental and interdisciplinary research projects and the applied biophysics and nanoscience education programs in the Rio Grande Valley, South Texas region. The IF-AFM will be installed at the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) and will be used as a shared characterization facility. This instrument is designed to measure a variety of physical, chemical, and biophysical properties including nanostructural, nanomechanical, and electrical at the single molecule level and under a variety of conditions. The optical integration offers almost endless possibilities in high resolution imaging, force measurements, and nanomanipulations. The attractive feature of the IF-AFM is that the AFM tip can be guided optically to perform nanomanipulations at specific areas of the specimen. This technique is uniquely capable of shedding light on the interplay between individual and collective behavior. This acquisition will enhance the existing research and educational infrastructure and will provide the state-of-the-art measurement system to a broad range of users in State of Texas, thereby elevating advanced nano-materials research and educational programs in the Rio Grande Valley to a globally competitive level. The IF-AFM instrument acquisition will enable significant enhancement of basic research toolset across a wide range of biophysical, biomedical, and material programs including physics of biofilm formation, bacterial adhesion, bacterial mechanics and dynamics, protein aggregation and interaction, bioimaging, and nanostructured surfaces. The enabling IF-AFM capabilities will inspire development of new transformative research directions to discover the underlying biophysical principles that govern the operation of cellular machinery and use this knowledge to unravel the mechanisms of many diseases that afflict millions of people. It is also expected that what is learned will help in the development of new biologically-inspired materials which will have far-reaching consequences for biomedical and bio-nanotechnological applications. This project brings together a diverse group of institutions in Texas and nationwide: University of Texas at Brownsville and University of Texas Pan American (UTPA) - the minority Hispanic universities, University of Texas at Austin and Dayton University. The IF-AFM has a wide range of capabilities which will benefit potential users from physics, engineering, biology, and biomedical fields. Shared use of the instrument will promote multi-institutional, inter-disciplinary collaborations that will enhance the educational experience of more than 80 undergraduate and graduate students of participating universities. The IF-AFM will also become an essential element of research-based training for physics, biology, biomedical, and engineering science majors from underrepresented minority group. The educational plan provides learning opportunities through combined (i) course development and (ii) hands-on observations.

0.387238,"The nature of dark matter is currently unknown. Cosmic rays, which are energetic sub-atomic particles from space that travel at velocities near the speed of light, can help to identify dark matter particles. This is because one possible cosmic ray production mechanism is the annihilation of dark matter particles. Cosmic ray antideuteron particles are a particularly interesting potential signature of dark matter annihilation. This CAREER award supports scientists at the University of Hawaii to study dark matter by performing the first measurements of the cosmic-ray antideuteron flux. The group will utilize data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), currently operating onboard the International Space Station, and data from the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS), a balloon experiment that is under development. This award will support scientific investigations that utilize the complementary capabilities of both experiments to perform high-sensitivity measurements of cosmic-ray antideuterons. The group is also developing a summer course to teach computer programming to local high school students. Students will be taught programming skills using Raspberry Pi computers. Mimicking scientific ballooning operations, the devices will be mounted on kites to measure temperatures and humidity, and take aerial pictures.<br/><br/>The planned program includes the development of antideuteron production physics simulations, analysis of AMS data, simulations and calibration of the GAPS detectors, and ultimately analysis of GAPS data. These experiments use different technologies to detect cosmic rays. Utilizing both provides the group with complementary data, extending the energy range of the proposed study and improving the control of the systematic effects that limit the sensitivity of the search for these rare events.

0.199997,"During the last years numerous laboratories worldwide have begun to develop high-powered laser systems to create electromagnetic radiation pulses that are so energetic that new avenues to probe and control the states of matter can be tested soon. The research team at Illinois State University plans to accompany these developments with ab initio computer simulations that can provide microscopic insight into the relativistic interaction of electrons and positrons with photons with full temporal as well as spatial resolution. A better understanding of these fundamental processes might open new ways to control atomic, chemical and even biological processes on very short time scales. An important mission for the grant is also to give undergraduate students the opportunity to gain research experience. This educational experience provides them with important skills including working as a team, gaining the endurance, intellectual flexibility and experience to tackle serious research problems, and communicating results in conferences and publications. <br/><br/>The computer simulations are obtained by solving the coupled set of Dirac-Maxwell equations of relativistic quantum electrodynamics on a numerical space-time grid. These non-perturbative large-scale calculations are very CPU time consuming but have become possible due to recent progress in the development of specialized numerical algorithms for massively parallel computers. The calculations are performed in Illinois and also at the XSEDE supercomputer cluster in Texas. A specific goal of the current grant is to simulate for the first time the laser-field induced electron-positron pair-creation process for a general situation for which the attractive Coulomb force between the two created particles is taken into account. Preliminary simulations for simplified model systems suggest that our present theoretical understanding of this process might need to be revised as this (so far neglected) inter-particle force might play a major role for the dynamics."
0.36,"Modern high-performance computer architectures highlight parallelism, heterogeneity, and re-configurability to provide both performance and power efficiency enhancements. These degrees of complexity present new challenges to computational physicists, who are required to remap existing software so that simulation tools run efficiently on novel computer architectures. In particular, plasma simulations using the particle-in-cell (PIC) method are widely used on a variety of topics including inertial fusion energy, plasma-based acceleration, space weather, and astrophysics. The goal of this project is to develop a set of general skeleton codes that can be used for experimentation, education, and for developing adaptable PIC software for next-generation many-core architectures. The activities supported here will focus on incorporating the best software practices into production codes for use on present and future high-performance computers, on experimenting with novel ideas for load balancing and tradeoffs in performance and accuracy, for analyzing and storing large data sets, and on developing ""desktop"" versions of PIC codes for use by a wide audience and broaden their impact. <br/><br/>This project will provide scientists with powerful simulation tools by tapping into the vast computing power of graphic cards commonly used for video games.

0.096789,"Very small particles can behave in ways that are contrary to common sense. For example, an electron (one of the particles that make up atoms) can be at multiple locations at the same time and can tunnel through a barrier--something forbidden by the classical laws of physics. The theory that explains these counterintuitive behaviors of small particles is ""quantum mechanics"". This CAREER project will investigate the possibility of making quantum mechanics appear manifest in larger, more macroscopic, systems. In specific, the project will investigate how to couple the spin of an electron to the motion of a nanoparticle (containing millions of atoms). The nanoparticle will be levitated by a laser beam in vacuum to avoid perturbations from the environment. This system should serve as a very sensitive force detector with many applications. It may enable other experiments to study the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics, a longstanding problem in physics. The research will be integrated with several related educational activities, including direct training of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research, and conducting inquiry workshops about infrared light for middle and high school teachers and students. Infrared light is not visible to human eyes, but plays a crucial role in global warming and fiber-optic communication. In the present work, infrared light will be used to levitate nanoparticles in vacuum. After doing hands-on experiments with infrared light in the workshop, teachers will be able to take their apparatus for use in their classrooms.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, this research project will develop a system that combines the advantages of both trapped atoms and conventional optomechanical systems for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics: an optically levitated nanodiamond with a built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. In some ways, this system can be considered to be an ""artificial atom"" with a very large mass. The electron spin of the NV center can be coupled to the motion of the nanodiamond with a magnetic field gradient. This coupling can be used to create large quantum spatial superposition states of the nanodiamond, which will lead to the development of a nanoparticle matter-wave interferometer for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics in unexplored parameter regimes. The main focus of this CAREER project will be to experimentally study the coupling between an NV electron spin and both the center-of-mass motion and the rotation of an optically levitated nanodiamond. The motion of the levitated nanodiamond will be cooled to near quantum ground state by active feedback cooling. The NV electron spin will be used to sense and manipulate the motion of the nanodiamond. It will also be used to measure the internal temperature of the levitated nanodiamond which affects the quantum coherence time."

0.085,"Stars with masses greater than eight times the mass of the sun end their lives in an explosion called a core-collapse supernova. If the original star is between eight and twenty times the mass of the sun, the supernova leaves behind a neutron star. Neutron stars are ultra-dense objects with the mass of the sun and a diameter of about 15 miles. Normal matter is made of atoms consisting of electrons and nuclei, nuclei are made of neutrons and protons, and neutrons and protons, in turn, are made of up and down quarks. The gravitational force in the center of a neutron star, however, is sufficient to compress neutrons and protons together so tightly that neutrons and protons may be forced to convert into exotic particles containing strange quarks. The question of whether or not strange quarks are present in neutron stars, and the more general question of the nature of extremely dense matter, are some of the principal questions facing the nuclear physics and astrophysics communities. This project aims to answer these questions and to determine the nature of matter in the center of neutron stars where gravity compresses matter to a thousand trillion times the density of water. This project involves training opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellow. Community outreach includes the education of students through the continued development of a Studio Physics course, involvement in research, and a web-based visualization of neutron stars.<br/><br/>Nuclear experiments and observations of neutron stars have successfully generated novel constraints on the equation of state of matter at densities near and above the central densities in atomic nuclei. However, our current understanding of high-densities is limited: we do not yet know the composition of the ground state. This project uses a combination of nuclear theory matched to nuclear data and neutron star observations to determine the composition of neutron star cores. Modern models of strongly-interacting matter will be combined with new nuclear structure calculations of neutron-rich nuclei in order to construct state of the art models of the neutron star crust and core. These models, and their concomitant uncertainties, will be calibrated with nuclear data and compared with neutron star cooling, mass, and radius observations. For example, neutron star cooling data has already given indications of fast cooling arising from a large proton-to-neutron ratio. This project will study the posterior probability distribution for the proton-to-neutron ratio and several other observables that will give insights into neutron star composition. <br/><br/>This proposal is co-funded by the Theoretical Nuclear Physics Program in the Physics Division and the Division of Astronomical Sciences at NSF."
0.049163,"Ultra-high-energy neutrinos are unique astrophysical messengers that interact weakly with intervening matter and can therefore be used to probe the distant universe. A small but theoretically observable flux of these ultra-high-energy neutrinos is expected to be produced by the interaction between high-energy ""cosmic ray"" charged particles and cosmic microwave background photons as the cosmic rays travel through the Universe. Observing these cosmogenic neutrinos would allow physicists to begin to study physics at energies beyond the standard models. The large volume of radio transparent ice covering the geographic South Pole in Antarctica has hosted several pioneering efforts to detect these high energies neutrinos using a radio Cherenkov ""Askaryan effect."" The Askaryan effect describes the process by which ultra-high-energy neutrinos traversing the dense polar ice generate observable radio waves. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located at the South Pole Station, was designed to exploit this phenomenon to first detect and ultimately study these ultra-high-energy neutrinos. This award provides funding to deploy two more ARA stations to the existing suite of three stations, and to continue observations. The award will support the involvement of students, including undergraduate students, who will be engaged in on-site activities at the South Pole. It will also support outreach efforts including activities with QuarkNet.<br/><br/>ARA is designed to be implemented in phases. During the initial phase the ARA project deployed a testbed and three full stations that used equipment designed and built for the co-located IceCube Neutrino Observatory.

0.869999,"The elements observed on the earth and in our sun contain the most stable isotopes of nuclei. However, there are a great many other forms of these isotopes with greater or lesser numbers of neutrons that only exist for a short time. The formation of these unstable nuclei is essential for understanding the origin of the observed elements during astrophysics events such as supernovae explosions. This project in nuclear theory will contribute significantly to our understanding of the observed properties of stable and unstable nuclei and predicts properties that are not yet observed. This research quantifies the limits of nuclear stability and chains of formations and decays that are needed for understanding the formation of elements during the evolution of the universe. Nuclear decays are determined by the properties of the fundamental particles. The investigators will also study a form of double-beta decay in which no neutrinos are emitted and in which the mass of the neutrino may be determined. Furthermore, this project will advance computational and analytical methods in nuclear physics, and will add to an already rich computational program for nuclear structure that is being used worldwide.<br/><br/>Nuclear physics is at the heart of our understanding of the universe and the types of elementary particles with which it is composed. This project will have a significant impact on new developments in the field of nuclear theory, fundamental symmetries, nuclear astrophysics and the general field of mesoscopic physics. Topics to be studied include: (1) development of new analytical and computational tools for the description of nuclear structure (2) detailed theoretical studies of nuclear processes affecting unstable nuclei; (iii) calculations and modeling of structural and dynamical aspects of nuclear processes, including reactions of astrophysical interest; (iv) calculations of nuclear properties related to fundamental symmetries and double-beta decay; (v) development of the unified description of structure and reactions in open and marginally stable mesoscopic systems and quantum transport in problems of interest to quantum informatics; (vi) studies of the nucleus as a mesoscopic system, including many-body quantum chaos and its coexistence with collective and regular features. Many of these research topics are connected to the experimental programs at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and other laboratories worldwide. This work is also closely coupled with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA), and some projects bridge nuclear structure theory with other areas, such as condensed matter physics and quantum information. Strong educational and outreach component are integral components of this effort, as the nuclear physics program at MSU is widely recognized worldwide as a top program in this discipline."
0.185492,"Rayleigh-Taylor instability and turbulent mixing governs a wide variety of plasma phenomena in nature and technology, spanning astrophysical to microscopic scales and low to high energy density regimes. It influences the formation of the 'hot spot' in inertial confinement fusion, limits radial compression of imploding Z-pinches, drives penetration of stellar ejecta into pulsar wind nebula, dominates energy transport in core-collapse supernova, provides conditions for synthesis of heavy mass elements in thermonuclear stellar flashes, controls material transformation under high strain rates, and strongly affects the dynamics of shocks and blast waves. Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops when matters (plasmas) of different densities are accelerated against the density gradients. The induced material mixing is a complex (anisotropic, inhomogeneous and statistically unsteady) turbulent process, whose theoretical description requires novel approaches that go well beyond the domain of idealized canonical considerations. The tremendous successes achieved recently in high energy density plasma experiments and in large-scale numerical simulations, and the striking similarity of behavior of Rayleigh-Taylor mixing in vastly different physical regimes make this moment right for a theory to appear and to advance knowledge of fundamental aspects of the non-equilibrium turbulent processes in plasmas.<br/><br/>The core of this theoretical approach is a new concept, the invariance of the rate of momentum loss. This concept will be applied to capture the transports of mass, momentum and energy in Rayleigh-Taylor mixing plasmas and to study invariants, scale coupling, scaling, and statistics of the turbulent process. Group theory and stochastic analysis considerations will be employed, and coherence and randomness of the dynamics will be analyzed and related to space-time symmetries of the conservation laws. Incorporating the high energy density conditions, the dependencies of integral characteristics of plasma mixing will be investigated and their connection will be established to the control parameters of simulations and experiments (e.g. target non-uniformities in high-power laser experiments). The developed theoretical foundations will be further applied to analyze existing datasets and to advance the design of experiments and simulations. The project will impact a broad range of disciplines in science, mathematics and engineering, including plasmas, high energy density physics, astrophysics, mathematical physics, stochastic processes, fluid dynamics, and material science, as well as technology in the areas of nuclear energy and communications. It will also initiate a new program for graduate education on modern methods of theoretical modeling and advanced data analysis techniques. The theoretical tools will be communicated through and contribute to the development of a newly emerging international research community 'Turbulent mixing and beyond.'"
0.0972,"Epidermal growth factor gradient sensing by epithelial cells is a crucial process in development and many disease processes such as cancer metastasis. Understanding the basic principles of this sensing would enable us to intervene in disease processes that involve directional cell motion by pharmacologically targeting the communication rather than the within-cell regulation, and it can stimulate a novel direction for therapeutics. Through a combination of novel experimental and theoretical approaches, this project will characterize advantages and limitations of multicellular gradient sensing in breast epithelial tissue in a mouse model. It will explore the fundamental physical limits on collective gradient sensing and will establish to which extent the size of multicellular ensembles aids their sensory precision. The project will also support synergistic curriculum development efforts on the interface of physics and biology at three research universities, on levels from introductory undergraduate to advanced graduate. It will provide research and broader career training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, including minority students. The PIs will engage elementary school students in science projects and they will reach out to the general public disseminating their research findings at the Atlanta Science Festival.<br/><br/>Cells in multicellular organisms rarely act alone in responding to external signals, but little is known about behaviors that emerge from their multicellular, collective communication and action. In particular it is unknown if multicellular ensembles can collectively sense chemical gradients in ways that take advantage of such ensembles spanning substantial ranges of the chemo-attractant concentration. The PIs' experiments with multicellular ensembles of breast epithelial cells exposed to gradients of epidermal growth factor suggest that these cells can sense gradients collectively and that collectively cells respond to gradients that are far smaller than those sensed by individual cells. This multicellular information processing is fundamentally distinct from, and not simply reducible to, sensory processes in isolated cells. The PIs will establish theoretically and verify experimentally the fundamental physical limits on the precision of gradient sensing by multicellular ensembles. These limits containing contributions from the extrinsic ligand stochasticity and from the intrinsic noise in communicating the measurements made by distant cells in a multicellular group to individual cells within the group will be characterized. The PIs will develop computational methods to analyze precision of biological information processing in collective, nonlinear phenomena, such as epithelial tissue rearrangement, which will be applicable broadly in other biophysical contexts."

This will be achieved by developing novel analysis algorithms to search for these new massive particles and advanced high-speed electronics that enhance the performance of the ATLAS detector in key domains. For broader impact, the PI will be leading the Lane Tech High School U. Chicago Outreach Program and the Enrico Fermi Summer Interns Program for 7th graders.

This research includes development of novel analysis algorithms and advanced high-speed electronics. His goal is to search for evidence of Supersymmetry in final states characterized by Lorentz-boosted massive particles using distinct signatures in the ATLAS calorimeter system, and to better understand the Standard Model processes involved that form a large background to these new states. The particles sought should generate multi-jet final states, and new algorithms will be introduced to recognize them. In addition, this effort will be integrated into the development of high-speed electronics for new triggering systems, vital to the future running of Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The PI's group will perform detailed measurements of Standard Model processes that will help to better understand the backgrounds these represent to the new signals sought. Timing of this program corresponds to the higher center of mass energy of Run II at the LHC which should increase the yield of processes such as collinear emission of a W-boson, the intermediate carrier of the weak force and a prime target of study in this work. For broader impact, the excitement and results of this physics program will be communicated through K-12 and undergraduate education programs. These programs will include community outreach activities that target underrepresented students in the City of Chicago. The PI will be leading the Lane Tech High School U.

0.24,"According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, massive astrophysical objects can produce gravitational waves, which are ripples in the geometry of space-time that travel outward at the speed of light. Scientists around the world are currently building and refining exquisitely sensitive instruments, named LIGO in the U.S. and Virgo in Europe, to detect these tiny ripples directly for the first time. These instruments are expected to detect signals from colliding neutron stars, black holes, and/or other sources starting in a few years. The work supported by this award will increase the science value of LIGO-Virgo data by enabling rapid communication and joint analysis with astronomers who may see the same events using optical, radio, X-ray or gamma-ray telescopes--""multi-messenger"" science. Among other things, this work has the potential to test theories of the origins of short gamma-ray bursts and fast radio bursts, two types of brief enigmatic signals seen by astronomers. Besides direct scientific results, this research will build cooperation within the scientific community, and results will be shared with the general public through summaries posted on the ligo.org web site and at outreach events.<br/><br/>Building on previous experience, we will pursue two main projects to enable multi-messenger searches. First, we will play a leading role in preparing the ""electromagnetic (EM) follow-up program"" that the LIGO and Virgo collaborations have committed to supporting. We will provide software tools and validation to select gravitational-wave (GW) event candidates, assemble relevant information, and send alerts to astronomers who have partnered with LIGO and Virgo to actively search for EM counterparts. We will facilitate communication among partners and participate in the analysis of any astrophysical events that are jointly observed. Second, we will implement and carry out joint searches for GW signals and radio bursts detected by large-field-of-view radio telescope facilities such as LWA1. Combined with the all-sky sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo, this will improve our ability to detect certain types of rare astrophysical transients while suppressing local noise sources."
0.270547,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the mass of the Higgs boson has the value it has. To answer these questions it is necessary to go beyond the present picture of the Universe described by the Standard Model to the next phase of development, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Investigations in BSM physics probe such questions as why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. The LHC is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering Beyond the Standard Model questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson, and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC has as one of its primary functions to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. The work proposed here will contribute to the upgrade necessary to handle the higher energy of the newly-restarted LHC and to analyze data from the CMS experiment to look for BSM physics through the search for two candidate theoretical particles for BSM physics, a heavy charged Higgs boson and the so-called Wprime particle. <br/><br/>This award will fund two aspects of the CMS experiment: 1) further searches for BSM physics and 2) help build the CMS Phase I forward pixel detector upgrade, which will enhance the ability of CMS to discover BSM physics. The physics studies enabled by this award are the searches for Wprime and Heavy Charged Higgs, two candidate theoretical particles for BSM physics. The presence of a signal in any of these channels would have profound impact on our understanding of particle physics, while establishing its absence would provide important constraints on models of physics beyond the Standard Model. The CMS Forward pixel upgrade will allow the precise vertex location, needed for all physics studies, even in the harsh environment (very high luminosity) expected in near future LHC running. The CMS Forward Pixel Detector uses state-of-the art silicon technology for particle detection combined with equally sophisticated readout electronics. Innovative techniques of radiation hard technology and bump bonding have been used in the current detector to meet the real estate challenges in a high radiation environment. These techniques would greatly enhance the life span of detectors used in outer space research and improve bio-sensing miniature devices for medical applications."

A remarkable achievement of Twentieth Century Particle Physics was the development of the Standard Model that describes impressively well a broad spectrum of fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons and the interactions (the forces) among them. But the Standard Model is incomplete and we know there is important physics that lies beyond it. What is the evidence? As an example, astronomical observations indicate that the known particles of the Standard Model make up only 1/6 of the total matter in the Universe. The remainder is called ""Dark Matter"" because we don't see it directly. A number of experiments are underway or in the planning stage to look for the Dark Matter, which might be one type of particle or possibly many or perhaps something else entirely.

Such an A´ couples leptons (such as electrons and positrons) to dark matter, as suggested by astrophysical observations, and may explain a possible discrepancy with the Standard Model in the observed value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (the so called ""g-2 anomaly""). DarkLight has the unique feature of searching for the A´ in exclusive reactions. The phase-I realization of the DarkLight instrument will have three scientific goals: to carry out important accelerator science studies involving the interaction of the energy-recovering linac beam with the DarkLight gas target and solenoid; to carefully measure Standard Model background processes; and to carry out a first search for the A´ via detection of e+e- pairs in the mass region 30 to 70 MeV/c2 using this new experimental technique."
0.329125,"Particle Physics is the science of discovery of the fundamental constituents of matter and energy and is involved in the exploration of the Universe from the smallest to the largest scales. A remarkable achievement of Twentieth Century Particle Physics was the development of the Standard Model that describes impressively well a broad spectrum of fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons and the interactions (the forces) among them. But the Standard Model is incomplete and we know there is important physics that lies beyond it. What is the evidence? As an example, astronomical observations indicate that the known particles of the Standard Model make up only 1/6 of the total matter in the Universe. The remainder is called ""Dark Matter"" because we don't see it directly. A number of experiments are underway or in the planning stage to look for the Dark Matter, which might be one type of particle or possibly many or perhaps something else entirely. This MRI award will allow the excellent training of young physicists from the institutions in the DarkLight consortium in accelerator science, detector and target development and utilization, measurement and analysis, and search for new evidence of new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>This Major Research Instrumentation award is made to a consortium of MIT, Hampton University, Arizona State University and Temple University to develop, build and operate a first phase of the DarkLight experiment at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory.

1.07,"Plasma acceleration is a cutting-edge technique for accelerating charged particles such as electrons using the electric field associated with a plasma structure, such as an electron plasma wave. The plasma structure is created using either ultra-short laser pulses or particle beams. This technique offers a way to build high performance particle accelerators of much smaller size than conventional accelerator techniques. The stimulating laser or electron beam creates a charge ""wake"" in the plasma. Particles ""ride"" this wave and are thus accelerated in this technique called plasma wakefield acceleration (PWA). Exploiting new modes for particle acceleration can have significant impact, as accelerators represent a significant technological tool addressing many applications in medicine and industry.<br/><br/>This award will focus on developing ionization injection for plasma wakefield accelerators. To make a practical PWA device, a narrow energy spread of electrons of sufficient energy must be controlled and injected into the plasma. This award will allow the development of these electron bunches, called bunchlets. The work will include a demonstration that the bunchlets can be controlled and can be tuned to a desired energy.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>If successful this work will solve the problem of precisely (self-) placing an ultra-short electron bunch in the plasma wake that can extract a significant amount of energy from the wake and has the potential to generate extremely low emittance beams. The successful demonstration of the ideas presented here will greatly impact both future accelerator and light source development.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Modern beam physics/accelerator science needs a workforce with training in broader areas than currently offered within the conventional accelerator field such as laser science, plasma physics and atomic physics. This award will provide this type of training to excellent students with just such a broad background. If successful, the ideas pursued in this work could potentially transform future particle accelerator and light sources."
0.9975,"This award will enable the group to continue a comprehensive program in neutrino-less double-beta decay (NDBD). The intellectual merit of this activity is based on the fact that NDBD is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton number conservation, an important symmetry in elementary-particle physics. If indeed neutrinos are Majorana particles, a measurement of the NDBD half-life would yield the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino. Combined with neutrino oscillation data, it would determine all three neutrino mass eigenvalues. Leptogenesis in the early universe is only possible if there are Majorana neutrinos. The laboratory observation and measurement of NDBD would be transformative of elementary particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>The group is working on two NDBD experiments: CUORE and MAJORANA. USC has the major tasks of the procurement, production, installation, and maintenance of the front-end CUORE electronic system from the detector to the data acquisition system, and is involved in the construction and operation of CUORE-0, the first tower of CUORE. USC leads a major Task in the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR R&D which has the responsibility for the procurement of enriched germanium oxide, its reduction to metal, zone refinement to detector quality metal, and reprocessing of scrap material. USC led the construction and operation of the facility for the germanium (Ge) processing. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Discovery would make important contributions to astrophysics and cosmology.

0.347165,"This research aims to understand the exciting array of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in New York. Two particle correlation measurements and related fluctuation studies can reveal space-time information about particle production and dynamics not measured by single particle observables. The activity supported by this award centers on an innovative program to develop theoretical tools for the analysis of correlations in a hydrodynamic context. Applications of this framework to transverse-momentum fluctuation data already provide a first estimate of the shear viscosity.<br/><br/>RHIC experiments exhibit a striking ""ridge"" of enhanced correlations that has garnered substantial interest. This ridge occurs both with and without a jet trigger, and is part of a rich correlation landscape. We propose to apply our hydrodynamic framework to understand this landscape at RHIC and LHC. These efforts promise to reveal information on both early stages of particle production - the glasma - as well as the later period of hydrodynamic evolution. This and similar work is driven by data analyzed at Wayne State. Close collaboration with these experimenters puts this theory group in an excellent position to understand and influence such analyses.<br/><br/>The colliders RHIC and LHC smash nuclei together, producing a tiny fleeting soup of elementary particles called the quark-gluon plasma. By studying the fluid characteristics of this plasma using mathematical models, we hope to explain what is seen at these massive colliders.

1.365,"This work by the University of Illinois Chicago particle physics group is focused on improving our understanding of the Universe at the smallest scales, allowing us to probe nature?s basic symmetries and their relation to our fundamental understanding of mass. By precisely measuring the properties of the newly discovered Higgs boson with the CMS detector at the LHC, key insights will emerge into how electroweak symmetry is broken and the fundamental property of mass. Other topics that this research will explore include searches for manifestations of supersymmetry and exotic new phenomena beyond the Standard Model involving strong dynamics. Enabling tools and methods for this research include their work on hardware and software development for CMS. The group also has an established Quarknet outreach activity in Chicago-area high schools."
0.288,"This CAREER award is for an integrated program of research, education, and outreach focusing on quantum field theories with conformal symmetry (CFTs). The primary goals are: 1) To further our knowledge of how conformal symmetry constrains correlation functions in CFTs. While the forms of 2-point and 3-point functions are fixed by conformal symmetry, 4-point functions are not completely determined, and can in general be expanded into a basis of functions called conformal blocks. Knowing how to perform these expansions explicitly is extremely important for formulating basic consistency conditions (called crossing symmetry) in any field theory with conformal symmetry. The PI will develop the theory of conformal blocks, focusing on situations (e.g., correlation functions of operators with spin and CFTs in odd dimensions) where these decompositions are poorly understood. 2) To perform detailed analytical and numerical studies of the implications of crossing symmetry and unitarity (the conformal bootstrap) in CFTs. These studies will produce general rigorous bounds on physical observables (operator dimensions) and develop techniques to predict their values in a wide variety of physically relevant theories. By pursuing these studies, the PI is seeking to map out the space of CFTs, identify new CFTs and learn about known ones, make quantitative predictions for experimentally realizable condensed matter systems, explore the validity of ideas in physics beyond the standard model, and test and formulate new theoretical conjectures related to the AdS/CFT correspondence and quantum gravity. <br/><br/>Conformal invariance is a generalization of scale invariance that only requires that the angles between corresponding curves do not change. Conformal field theories (CFT) lie at the heart of theoretical physics, linking all the fields of physics represented within the Physics Division as well as other programs in other Divisions in NSF. They are ubiquitous in the space of quantum field theories; they holographically describe (connect properties in a volume to the information encoded in the surface of that volume) consistent theories of quantum gravity; they are realized in a wide variety of real-world condensed matter systems such as the critical three-dimensional Ising model of ferromagnetism in terms of the coupling between spins of neighboring atoms; and they may even play an important role in physics beyond the Standard Model, the concept that accurately describes the known elementary particles in terms of quarks, leptons and gauge fields. There are wide classes of physically relevant CFTs where conventional field theory techniques such as perturbation theory and large-N expansions cannot be used. The recursive conformal bootstrap approach is currently underdeveloped and appears to be an extremely promising way of making quantitative predictions for physical observables in these otherwise intractable theories.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts : The education and outreach component of this program will introduce students at all education levels to the power of symmetry in physics. 1) The PI is developing a series of hands-on demonstrations illustrating principles of symmetry in physics, being made available to middle and high school students in racially diverse and high poverty school districts through Yale's ""Math Mornings"" lecture series and during a ""Theoretical Physics Day"" hosted by the PI. 2) The PI is developing a public lecture on ""Symmetries in Physics"" to be given in multiple venues. 3) The PI is developing and teaching two distinct 3-day Modules for Yale's Pathways Science Collaborative Hands-On Learning and Research (SCHOLAR) program, one focusing on symmetries of space and time and one focusing on exploring scale invariance and extra dimensions. 4) The PI is actively involving Yale undergraduates in his research as well as including their participation in outreach activities. 5) The PI is developing a new graduate level course on ""Conformal Field Theories"", introducing Yale students to modern research topics, giving them opportunities to develop their oral presentation skills, and producing a set of lecture notes that will be disseminated publicly."

When HAWC begins operations in August 2013 with 100 Water Cherenkov Detectors it will be the most sensitive wide-field detector in the TeV range, with an approximately five times increase in sensitivity over the previous generation of detectors. During the first year of operation, HAWC's sensitivity will steadily increase as the full 250 detectors are gradually brought online. HAWC will monitor the northern sky and make coincident observations with other observatories including VERITAS, HESS, Magic, IceCube and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope for multi-wavelength and multi-messenger studies of the high-energy sky. HAWC will observe Galactic sources in the TeV energy range, detect diffuse emission from regions of the Galactic plane, observe known TeV active galactic nuclei and the brightest known gigaelectronvolt (GeV) gamma-ray bursts, and with its significant increase in sensitivity it is poised to discover new high-energy phenomena in the Universe.<br/><br/>The University of Maryland group has a significant leadership role in HAWC.

0.12713,"Einstein's General Relativity is a pillar of modern physics, describing all known gravitational phenomena. The work in this project will advance our understanding of the foundations of General Relativity. Though it is our best fundamental theory of gravity to date, General Relativity has yet to be successfully combined with quantum theory and elementary particle theory into a single unified theory of physics. Recent work has pointed to the possibility that observable hints of such a unified theory could be manifested as minuscule violations of the foundations of General Relativity theory, including local Lorentz symmetry, which encapsulates the principles of Special Relativity. The proposed work will make use of a general theoretical framework for describing generic hypothetical Lorentz violation, called the Gravitational Standard-Model Extension, which has been widely adopted in recent years. The principal investigator will further develop this framework revealing new types of observable signals for Lorentz violation in experiments and observations including lunar laser ranging, gravimeter tests, and gravitational wave signals.<br/><br/>This work will positively impact researchers involved in precision tests of physical laws by providing motivation and additional areas in which to search for novel effects and new physics beyond General Relativity. The expected small size of any hypothetical Lorentz-violating signal continues to motivate the development of more precise measurement techniques by many experimental teams contributing to current precision instrument standards and the general field of metrology. The setting for this work is at a primarily undergraduate institution and this award will increase the visibility of such institutions in cutting-edge research. Accessible theoretical projects will be available to undergraduate students in physics, including minorities and women. This will impact undergraduate students who will be encouraged to pursue theoretical physics and be more likely to attend graduate school in physics."
0.15,"Quantum gravity is the theory that arises from combining gravity with relativity (how observers compare time and distance) and quantum mechanics (the key principle of which is that every degree of freedom has a tiny amount of motion). It has long been the subject of wild speculation, unchecked by the usual chain of observation and experiment which characterizes hard science. Recent advances in observational and theoretical cosmology have changed this by providing the first quantum gravitational data ever taken, with a vast potential for increase. The very early universe was expanding so rapidly and with such a high degree of acceleration that the usually tiny fluctuations of gravitational fields in empty space were amplified to a still-small but measurable amount. Equally important, these fluctuations were stretched out in space so far that they became effectively fossilized, and were thereby able to survive down to the current epoch. This project will study how these fluctuations affect gravity itself, and also the other forces and particles. Such studies are part of the great transformation of quantum gravity from science fiction to science fact, and the phenomenon they reveal may help us to better understand the current universe.<br/><br/>Interactions which involve undifferentiated gravitons and/or massless, minimally coupled scalars can give rise to greatly enhanced quantum effects during primordial inflation. This is the source of cosmological perturbations and recent work has turned from these primary effects to secondary effects arising from loop corrections to the power spectra and other quantities. The PI will address these problems over the next three years by continuing work in six areas: Computing and fully renormalizing graviton loop contributions to 1PI 2-point functions in general gauges; defining nonlinear extensions of cosmological observables based on nonlocal functionals of the metric; computing the one and two loop expectation value of an invariant measure of spacetime expansion; studying nonperturbative secular effects using the scattering of matter quanta by inflationary gravitons; investigating nonlocal modified gravity models of inflation, of late time acceleration and of MOND; and exploring phenomenological implications of inflationary perturbations build up from past evolution."
0.05153,"When LIGO detects a gravitational wave, a group of data analysts within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) addresses the question ""What exactly produced this wave?"", by employing a suite of tools designed to estimate source parameters of detected signals. Their findings extend our understanding of the universe, and inspire the next generation of scientists. The process of parameter estimation requires that the observed wave be compared to many millions of gravitational waves generated by theoretical models. However, this poses a major challenge: the software currently used for this task is far too slow, requiring up to 1,000 years to estimate parameters for a single detected gravitational wave. This grant will support an effort to improve this software platform performance by a factor of 10,000, which will greatly increase the usefulness of this state-of-the-art and widely-used model for LSC parameter estimation. The grant will also support the implementation of an automated software validation system for the LSC, to prevent certain types of software ""bugs"" from influencing parameter estimation.<br/><br/>For cases where the sources of interest are spinning black-hole pairs, the LSC primarily makes use of two highly-reliable theoretical models based on supercomputer-generated solutions to Einstein's equations of General Relativity. One of these models is called SEOBNRv3 (short for Spinning Effective One Body-Numerical Relativity model, version 3). The SEOBNR series of gravitational waveform models are among the best available for parameter estimation (PE) of spinning black-hole binaries, filling gaps in perturbative waveform approximants with results from numerical relativity simulations. Despite their great efficiency and reliability when compared to numerical relativity waveforms, SEOBNR codes are still far too slow to be directly useful for standard Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based PE. This award supports work to drastically improve the performance of the official SEOBNRv3 (v3) software. In addition to this effort, the award will support the education of graduate students in STEM areas of research."
0.169034,"A host of problems in scientific research, security, and commerce involve events registered by many devices in multiple locations. The result is fragmented information that must be gathered and built into a coherent whole. In addition, these events may come in rapid succession. When the event rate is high and the number of fragments large, the problem comes to resemble that of assembling tens, hundreds or even thousands of puzzle pieces that are continually being dumped into a common container. Further, puzzle pieces can become damaged or lost, introducing errors into the puzzle assembly process. These challenges are well-studied in the field of computational (nanoscale) self-assembly, which models processes such as the growth of crystals from organic molecules in solution. This project adapts computational self-assembly models to create a new paradigm that treats pieces of information from multiple sensors like molecules randomly meeting and assembling in solution. The result is a dynamic, fluid database of information chunks that evolve over time to form complete, accurate associations. This approach is applied to assemble data from the telescope arrays of very-high-energy gamma-ray observatories. A successful proof of concept in this domain is of interest to more than high-energy astrophysicists. The methods developed here are relevant to high data-volume experiments in other areas of physics and may have further applications to data transport and mining problems in the economic and security sectors.<br/><br/>This radically different method of fault-tolerant association of information from distributed sensors requires a proof-of-concept study, which will take place over a two-year period. The chosen test case is scientific. Very-high-energy gamma rays and cosmic rays initiate showers of charged particles in Earth's atmosphere, which in turn produce light due to an effect known as Cherenkov radiation. Arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes sample the light from a shower from multiple directions in order to more accurately infer the origin and energy of a given gamma ray. Assembling data from these telescopes into a description of a single gamma- or cosmic-ray shower (event-building) is typically done only once. Since revisiting the event-building process is impractical for a large (up to 100 petabytes per year) volume of data, errors become frozen into the data archive. This problem is addressed by the algorithmic self-assembly paradigm. Real and simulated data from the operating gamma-ray observatory VERITAS and simulated data from a planned next-generation observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), are used to develop the concept and iteratively design, prototype, and test simple implementations for these instruments. Novel signal processing techniques will be exploited to rapidly extract information used in the association process. A series of use-case-dependent benchmarks are used to assess the performance. CTA's size, roughly 100 telescopes distributed over a square kilometer, and high (30 gigabytes per second) data rates make it a particularly apt test case and a successful proof of concept could lead to adoption of this model by CTA."

1.650617,"PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0605119<br/>INSTITUTION: University South Carolina Research Foundation<br/>NSF PROGRAM: PHY ¨C INTERMEDIATE ENERGY NUCLEAR SCIENCE<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Avignone, Frank T. <br/><br/>TITLE: CUORE: Phase-I Construction and Crystal Bolometer Research and Development<br/><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of experimental neutrino-less double beta decay efforts has been greatly enhanced by the observation of the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos, the confirmation of oscillations of solar neutrinos by SuperKamiokande, the demonstration by the SNO experiment that the flux of 8-B neutrinos predicted by Bahcall is correct, and by the recent confirmation of the large Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein mixing angle solution of the solar-neutrino problem by the KamLAND experiment. However, these neutrino oscillation data cannot yield the mass scale of neutrinos, nor can they be used to determine that neutrinos are Majorana particles. If the mass of the electron neutrino is ¡Ü 0.2 eV, and neutrinos are Majorana particles, neutrino-less double beta decay is the only hope of determining the mass scale and it is the only practical experiment for determining that they are Majorana particles. Knowledge of the mass would determine what role, if any, neutrinos play as Hot Dark Matter candidates, and if they are Majorana particles, this opens the door to leptogenesis as a possible mechanism for the tiny particle over anti-particle asymmetry in the early universe that would have led to the particle dominated universe observed today.<br/><br/>Hence, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events), as a neutrino-less double beta decay experiment, has significant discovery potential. This proposal is a request to support the University of South Carolina (USC) in: 1) the first phase of the construction of the 130-Te CUORE experiment; the USC group proposes to take responsibility for the production of the electronic components necessary to instrument the 988 TeO2 bolometers; and 2) an R&D program to determine the technical feasibility and cost of constructing CUORE with Te enriched to 85% in 130-Te. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project relate to development of ultralow background Ge detectors, transferred now to commercial companies. The low background technology has been used to produce an ultra low background Ge detector for the Savannah River Low-Background Counting Facility.

2.49894,"Very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics has been transformed by a number of stunning discoveries made by the current-generation, ground-based gamma-ray observatories operating in the 100 GeV - 10 TeV energy range. These observatories are arrays of 2-4 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that detect VHE gamma-rays via Cherenkov light from secondary electrons in electromagnetic cascades initiated by gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Developing new instruments with significantly better sensitivity is not possible by a simple replication or upgrade of existing devices. <br/><br/>With this award, the proponents will build a novel gamma-ray telescope that has the potential to transform the field, based on work by Schwarzschild and Couder. It incorporates original ideas for the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments. The international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is preparing for a future IACT array with ten times better sensitivity and broader energy coverage to exploit the evident scientific potential of VHE gamma-ray observations. Some examples of new types of gamma-ray discoveries are searching extremely deeply for dark matter in the Galactic center and halo, testing cosmology with extragalactic background light measurements, resolving the details of shock acceleration in supernova remnants and pulsar winds, and advancing the physics of extragalactic jets by population studies and observations of short-term variability.<br/><br/>This new telescope overcomes the fundamental limitations in angular resolution and field of view of current prime-focus IACTs. At the same time, it allows the application of new, lower-cost technologies for the camera focal plane sensors. This work will demonstrate the enhanced performance and improved reliability of the SCT design, and the location adjacent to VERITAS will allow the performance to be evaluated against an instrument of known sensitivity. The results from this effort will enable informed choices to be made for the construction of CTA or other future instruments. It will also enhance the capabilities of the VERITAS Observatory.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Working with industry, this work will foster emerging technologies for the mass production of relatively inexpensive, light, aspheric mirror segments that will both enable future instruments to deliver unique science capabilities and encourage use of the design in the other fields of astronomy. This project will provide a unique opportunity for integrated research and education for a substantial number of young scientists."
2.403,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
0.201,"This project focuses on strongly correlated phases of cold-atomic systems in optical lattices where collective behavior is governed by laws of quantum mechanics. The prototypical strongly correlated fermionic systems -- the Hubbard model and resonant fermions in the regime of BCS-BEC crossover -- are central in the fields of the cold atom research and condensed matter. Understanding quantum plasticity and super transport in solid 4He remains one of big challenges in modern low-temperature physics. There is urgent need for universal unbiased first-principles methods for strongly correlated fermionic systems across all fields of physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. Ab initio and model simulations provide crucial information about quantitative and qualitative properties of these systems, test analytical predictions and help establish the proper theoretical framework, lay the ground for the unambiguous analysis of experimental data and further development of measuring techniques. In particular, this project aims to (i) develop generic diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) tools for continuous-space and lattice fermionic/fermionized systems: resonant fermions, Hubbard model, and frustrated spin systems, (ii) understand quantum plasticity and supertransport in solid helium-4, (iii) perform Worm Algorithm (WA) studies of quantum-critical phenomena and novel phases of ultra-cold atoms: deconfined criticality, universal critical dynamics, phases of multi-bound complexes of polar molecules.<br/><br/>An unbiased theoretical description of collective quantum phenomena is of vital interdisciplinary importance for a number of applied and fundamental areas, such as quantum computing and high-energy physics. High-end computing methods and techniques often find applications outside the physics community.

The algorithms developed in the project provide an example of how some of the difficulties may be circumvented. An integral part of the project is the training of graduate students and post-doctoral associate in advanced numeric techniques, quantum statistics, topical problems of atomic and solid state physics, network administration, and parallel supercomputing."
0.703,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Pran Nath, Haim Goldberg, Brent D Nelson and Tomasz Taylor at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigators (PIs) plan to carry out research in broad areas of particle physics with the aim of deciphering the nature of physics that lies beyond the Standard Model. Their theoretical investigations are closely linked with the current experimental efforts such as those at the Large Hadron Collider as well as in several underground experiments searching for dark matter and satellite experiments which probe the early history of the universe. The efforts of the PIs are based on supersymmetry, supergravity and string theory as these are the leading theoretical frameworks for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The PIs also plan to pursue neutrino cosmology and dark radiation in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and in Cosmic Microwave Background data coming from the PLANCK satellite experiment. <br/><br/>This research project also has a strong educational component which involves the training of graduate and undergraduate students. Several students will work with the PIs on their Ph.D. dissertations and additionally the research projects will be used as an educational tool for physics majors regarding developments on particle physics frontiers. The results of this research will be disseminated via publications in refereed journals, through open access arXiv.org, through talks at international conferences, and through popular journals. This research project will also involve collaborators from many countries and thus will enhance international collaboration in fundamental physics."
0.416307,"Even after more than a decade of great discoveries, the neutrino remains the most mysterious of the known fundamental particles. Basic questions about its properties endure; the most basic being whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle. If true, this Majorana nature of the neutrino would have profound implications to particle physics and cosmology, including an explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The only feasible experimental probes of the Majorana nature of the neutrino are experiments searching for the rare nuclear process, neutrinoless double-beta decay. The current set of experiments will probe the parameter space for Majorana neutrinos in the inverted mass hierarchy. The next generation of experiments will need to push into the normal mass hierarchy which requires an order of magnitude increase in mass and background suppression. <br/><br/>Liquid scintillator detectors scale well to large masses but advances are needed to obtain increased background suppression. This award will support a program of research that focusses on combining advances in photodetectors and the use of novel wavelength shifters in the form of nanocrystals called quantum dots to extract a directional signal from liquid scintillator detectors.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: Undergraduate research is critical for recruiting and retaining physics students. This award will be used to improve opportunities for transfer students. A seminar series on succeeding as a physics major will be developed and presented at UCLA. A modified version of the series will also be presented at Santa Monica College. Furthermore, this grant will sponsor an additional slot in UCLA's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program."

From stellar nurseries to the Earth's ionosphere, plasmas represent a fourth state of matter that is the most common form of matter in the visible universe. Moreover, a phenomenon known as a ""dusty"" or ""complex"" plasma is formed when charged particulate matter, such as dust or ices, becomes incorporated in the plasma environment. In space, phenomena such as in comet tails or the rings of Saturn are examples of dusty plasmas. Closer to Earth, control over particulates in plasmas are important in high-technology and microelectronic fabrication. In both astrophysical and technological plasmas, the presence of magnetic fields can have a profound influence on the properties of the plasma. This research project supports a new, state-of-the-art, multi-user, superconducting, high-magnetic device to understand the basic properties of a strongly magnetized plasmas and magnetized dusty plasma. The intellectual merit of this work is that it will enable the study of new regimes of plasma physics and dusty plasma physics that have not been accessible in previous experiments. The main project goal is to investigate how the structural, thermal, charging, and stability properties of a dusty plasma evolve as the system is taken from an unmagnetized state through a progression of regimes where first the electrons, then the ions, and then charged microparticles become magnetized.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work is substantial. This project is a direct collaboration among three US universities (Auburn University, The University of Iowa, and University of California-San Diego) that perform leading research in the field of dusty plasmas. The researchers from these three organizations will coordinate a broad team of collaborators representing universities, national laboratories, and international partners.

0.71983,"The program aims at a comprehensive study of the single atom response to an intense, ultra-fast burst of electromagnetic radiation that will not only provide basic tests of basic laws of physics but also initiate some novel experimental investigations in strong field physics. One objective is to broaden the scope of experimental investigations by utilizing the wavelength scaling of the strong field interaction at frequencies lower than the intrinsic electron motion. Various aspects of the strong field interaction have an implicit wavelength-dependence that is a crucial scaling parameter and has not been explored or exploited in a systematic fashion. Addressing these scaling laws with ionization experiments using ultra-short pulses in the mid-infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum is crucial since it tests the very foundations of all our understanding of the intense laser-atom interaction. A second objective is to understand and connect the behavior of atoms in intense x-ray fields with the more studied optical regime. These investigations are enabled by the new generation of hard x-ray freeelectron lasers being constructed worldwide. The first of these devices, which became operational in 2009, is the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Laboratory. Using the unprecedented x-ray intensities available at the LCLS, this program will explore the strong-field high frequency regime. Scaling laws suggest that the behavior at x-ray frequencies will have significant fundamental differences with the optical regime.<br/><br/>The interaction of an isolated atom with an intense electromagnetic field is the basis for one of the forefront problems in atomic, molecular and optical physics. The ability to couple large amounts of energy into an atom by the absorption of many photons posed many intriguing questions and has led to many new discoveries. At the core of the problem is the extreme nonlinear response of the atom to a laser pulse that imposes an external electric field comparable to the forces binding the electrons to the nucleus. The continuing interest in this fundamental atomic physics problem is derived from its broad implications in other areas of physics and technology. The single atom response is the initial condition of more complex phenomena found in plasmas, inertial confined fusion concepts, advance particle acceleration and astrophysics. The intense laser-atom interaction itself is opening new opportunities in short wavelength science, quantum control and advancing an emerging discipline in hyperfast electron physics, attophysics and molecular imaging. The novel long wavelength laser sources developed by this project have broad applications in science, national defense and technology. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of this research coupled with state-of-the-art ultra-fast optical engineering provides a fertile training ground for both undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, the LCLS XFEL has provided an exceptional educational opportunity for NSF supported students and a valuable resource for preparing the next generation of physicist trained in a frontier of ultra-fast x-ray science. Former group members are contributing to various areas of science and technology in academia, national laboratories and the private sector."
0.45,"We are carrying out two projects that will advance the state-of-the-art for disordered quantum gases, thus enabling new methods for attacking outstanding questions related to condensed matter physics and materials science. First, we are developing a technique to directly measure compressibility for ultra-cold gases trapped in 3D disordered optical lattices. We will apply this method to identify the nature of a disorder-induced insulator that we discovered, potentially detecting a Bose-glass phase using atoms unambiguously for the first time. Second, we are adding a cubic optical lattice to our disordered Fermi gas apparatus to achieve the first realization of the disordered Fermi-Hubbard model using ultra-cold atoms. <br/><br/>In these experiments, trapped atom gases are cooled to nanoKelvin temperatures using a combination of lasers and magnetic fields. A disordered optical lattice is superimposed on the gas by slowly turning on three pairs of counter-propagating infrared lattice laser beams and a green optical speckle field. The equivalent of material parameters, such as the disorder strength and tunneling energy, are smoothly tuned by adjusting the laser intensities. To measure compressibility, two laser beams (tuned near an electronic transition) applied to a Rubdium-87 gas will be used to image only the atoms located in the middle of the disordered lattice as the confining trap is changed. To create a disordered lattice for fermionic Potassium-40 atoms, additional lattice laser beams will be applied to an ultra-cold gas. We will measure the velocity of the gas as a force is applied in order to search for a predicted metal-insulator transition in the disordered lattice.<br/><br/>The interplay of disorder and strong interactions is one of the key outstanding problems in condensed matter physics. Fundamental questions center on how disorder and interactions either cooperate or compete to create localized phases in equilibrium and the influence of disorder on dynamical properties. The impact of disorder on quantum materials is also of prime importance to technological applications. Insight gained from our experiments may lead to improvements in materials with superlative properties that are important to energy applications, such as the high-temperature superconducting cuprates. Enhanced understanding of how disorder and interactions influence material properties may also enable new applications for strongly correlated materials in functions such as thermoelectric power generation."

0.18012,"A new element will be investigated as a prospective candidate for a next generation optical atomic clock and for laser cooling. Atomic clocks have been instrumental in the advancement of science and technology in the twentieth century, leading to innovations such as global positioning, advance communications, and tests of fundamental particle physics. A next generation optical atomic clock would extend the capabilities of these systems and will enable a renaissance of timing applications such as enhanced security for data routing and communications, advanced earth and space time-based navigation, geophysical surveying, testing Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, and searches for variations in the fundamental constants of the universe. Laser cooling is a technique for which the mechanical action of light is used to reduce the velocity of an atom in a gas. The use of lasers to cool atoms opened up new frontiers in physics ranging from the formation of new states of matter to enabling novel nanotechnologies. The extension of laser cooling to a new atomic species will enable the creation of novel ultracold atomic systems with unique properties and dynamics. The goal of this project is to investigate the atomic physics properties and implement laser cooling of atomic gadolinium for its potential use as an optical frequency standard and as a step to create new research avenues in atomic physics cross-fertilized with condensed matter physics. More specifically, these experiments will use lasers as a probe to determine the influence of external perturbations that limits its accuracy as an atomic clock. In addition, the spectral features of gadolinium will be characterized as a diagnostic tool to determine its cooling limits. This specific milestone will enable a gadolinium optical clock of greater accuracy and the realization of exotic ultracold quantum physics systems. This research program will support and train undergraduate and graduate students to become the next generation of scientists and engineers for fundamental and applied research in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. <br/><br/><br/>This project is an experimental research program directed towards investigating collisional and spectroscopic properties of atomic gadolinium (Gd). Gd is a novel class of atom that has an exotic electronic configuration and large ground state magnetic moment, which allows it to have submerged shell optical clock transitions, ultracold collisions having ground state angular momentum, and exotic quantum gas phases and phenomenon dominated by dipole-dipole forces. In particular, the collision studies involve measurements of collision quenching cross sections, and pressure broadening and shifts of the atomic states and line shapes of the optical clock and laser cooling transitions inside a Gd vapor cell. The objective is to characterize the collision sensitivity of these atomic transitions to give insight into the combined action of electron screening and configurational interactions. In addition, the radiative lifetimes, hyperfine structure, and isotope shifts of identified intercombination laser cooling transitions will be determined using laser induce fluorescence spectroscopy with an atomic beam. The determination of these spectroscopic properties are necessary for implementing narrow-line laser cooling for both bosonic and fermonic isotopes of gadolinium. Narrow-line laser cooling is essential for achieving quantum degeneracy with gadolinium, since its large ground state magnetic moment prevents evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap. In addition, laser cooling and trapping using electric-dipole transitions will be executed to create a magneto-optical trap of gadolinium as a first step towards performing precision measurements, investigating ultracold collision, and for studying atomic dipolar physics.<br/><br/>The experimental program will have three categories of broader impacts. First, forbidden transitions of rare earth elements are virtually unexplored. These atomic resonances are well suited as potential candidates for next generation frequency standards, with Q-factors nearly four orders of magnitude larger than current neutral atom clock lines, a suppression of black-body radiations shifts by exponents in the fine structure constant, and reduced sensitivity to collision. Moreover, for Standard Model Physics, these transitions have enhanced sensitivities to variations in the fine structure constant. Second, a laser cooled and trapped gas of gadolinium will have many applications: For nuclear physics, astrophysics, and biomedicine, laser cooled Gd will allow for economizing nuclear fuel consumption, ultrasensitive isotope trace analysis of the element for cosmo-chemical studies and biomedical sample testing respectively. Also with respect to nanostructure fabrication, an ultracold gas of Gd can be used for controlled doping or nanoscale milling to create novel magnetic devices. Third, graduate and undergraduate students who will help perform the proposed experiments will be trained. A goal of this project is to attract and retain more students in Atomic Molecular and Optical physics through the involvement of university students in the proposed experiments. This is augmented by the fact that the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a major research institution in the geographical region with an annual enrollment of nearly 18,000 students, and the research project involves the extensive use of lasers that is ideal for capturing a student's imagination. An additional goal is to recruit underrepresented minorities, which represents 25 percent of UAB's student population. Underrepresented minorities represent a large untapped wealth of potential for becoming contributors in the fields of science and engineering. To help address this matter a major plan is to involve minority graduate, undergraduate, and high school students via existing UAB outreach and REU programs to participate in research projects in the Simien Spectroscopy and Laser Cooling group. Furthermore, special outreach activities will be done with the aim to get K - 12 students interested in science and engineering by performing various physics, chemistry, and material science demonstration at local schools in the region."

0.12,"This project is devoted to research using ATLAS, a multi-purpose particle physics detector situated around the 27 km ring of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. The goal of the project is to explore the fundamental nature of the universe in order to understand its evolution from the hot, dense soup of energy and matter existing soon after the Big Bang to the cool, diffuse universe we see today. The interactions and evolution of the fundamental constituents of the universe are well described by the Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics that has been very successful in predicting the behavior of nature in the currently available energy regimes. The LHC is expected to restart operations in 2015 after a two-year upgrade program that allows the proton-proton collisions to reach an energy of 13 Tera-electron-Volt, almost twice the highest energy yet produced in any human-made device. This energy regime will allow for further understanding of the SM, exploration of the properties of the newly discovered Higgs Boson and the search for undiscovered particles and phenomena not described by the SM, yet believed to exist. <br/><br/>In this research project Professor Moss and his group at California State University, Sacramento (Sacramento State) will probe the electroweak sector of the SM using data collected ATLAS to test the SM at the new energy regime and to search for new phenomena. They propose to study couplings of Higgs Bosons to the electro-weak Z Bosons. Moss and his group, along with their colleagues in ATLAS will perform studies to optimize the performance of the ATLAS Pixel Detector and Diamond Beam Monitor and develop software and user interfaces for the supervisory controls and data acquisition of the ATLAS Detector."
0.93197,"This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Plasma Physics and Computational Physics programs in the Physics Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, the Magnetospheric Physics program in the Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences Division in the Directorate for Geosciences, and the Office of Integrative Activities. Ionized gas, or in scientific terms plasma, is the most common state of matter in the Universe. In the solar system, for example, the solar corona where solar eruptions occur, the solar wind that carries the erupted plasma and magnetic field from the Sun to the Earth, the magnetosphere surrounding the Earth and protecting us from the harmful effects of the eruption, and the ionosphere through which radio communications and GPS signals propagate and get disturbed, all consist of plasma. Understanding plasma is crucial for predicting and mitigating the effects of space weather. Plasmas also play an important role in engineering, for example in the design of fusion type reactors that promise to provide an inexhaustible source of clean energy for humanity. Computational modeling of plasma dynamics is very challenging due to the different spatial and temporal scales and the complex behavior of the system. The project is aimed at improving the efficiency of present plasma simulation models by a factor of 1000 or even more. If successful, the new model will provide accurate and affordable simulations for systems that currently cannot be modeled even on the largest supercomputers.<br/><br/>There are different approaches for plasma modeling that all have advantages and drawbacks. The most accurate kinetic methods describe all the important effects of plasma by describing the full distribution function in a six dimensional phase space, but they have tremendous computational cost. Even on today's supercomputers, modeling a large three-dimensional system with kinetic methods is far out of reach. Alternative fluid-type methods describe the plasma distribution function with a handful of moments, such as density, velocity and pressure. Solving for these quantities in addition to the magnetic field can be done quite efficiently, and in fact one can model the solar corona, the solar wind, and the magnetosphere with global fluid models with reasonable computational resources. Unfortunately, in most systems there are some parts of the domain where the fluid description is not sufficient, and this can have consequences for the global solution. The project aims at combining the kinetic and fluid type methods in an adaptive and dynamic fashion. The expensive kinetic model will be restricted to the small parts of the domain where the fluid description is not accurate enough, while the efficient fluid methods will be employed in the vast majority of the domain. This hybrid approach promises to provide accurate solutions at a tiny fraction of the cost of the fully kinetic models. A speed up of factor of 1000 or even more is expected. This will allow modeling global plasma systems with unprecedented accuracy and vastly improve our understanding and predictive capabilities."
0.101686,"This award supports a project that is part of a search for physics that does not have an explanation in the Standard Model (SM), the theory that describes the elementary particles making up the known visible matter in the universe. This will be done using the ATLAS multi-particle detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the European particle physics laboratory in Switzerland). In 2012 the Higgs Boson (H) was discovered at the LHC by both ATLAS and another large detector. The H was the last particle predicted to exist by the SM. Its discovery was one of the goals for the LHC. In this project, the PI and her small group of scientists will use the LHC running at twice the energy (13 TeV) achieved in 2012. They will look for events in which an H decays to a b anti-b quark pair (bb). The details of such decays, such as the frequency with which they occur, can reveal whether or not other Higgs-like particles, predicted in various extensions of the SM, exist. The increased energy will also allow them to search for further, more massive Higgs-like states. She and her group will also play a role in the planned upgrade of the ATLAS detector itself. They will work on the development and use of a device that very rapidly reconstructs data from silicon-based devices that map out the paths of charged particles passing through them. <br/><br/>This proposal will support one PI, a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student. This group will collect and analyze events from run II of the LHC which begins in the summer of 2015 and continues through the end of 2017. The LHC will be run at 13 TeV, the highest energy yet reached in any accelerator. The group's primary focus will lie in searches for modes that will include decays of H to bb, bb tau+tau-, W+bb and also to other more massive modes. They will also continue their development of the FTK, a hardware device that can quickly reconstruct the tracks in an event. This device will play a crucial role in handling the high rate and density of data anticipated."
0.75,"The physics program of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland is in full operation, delivering proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV collision energy. This CAREER program led by Prof Dmitri Tsybychev is focused on the ATLAS experiment and there are three aspects. The first is the study of events containing W + Jets and W + Jets + missing ET in the final state with the objective of measuring the cross section for WL WL scattering at high mass. In the absence of some control at the electroweak scale this cross section becomes unbounded. The Higgs boson is a means to control this, but there may be other new physics at play. The challenge is that the WW cross section is very small and hence high energy and high luminosity are both required. The second aspect of the program is focuses on the upgrade of the ATLAS vertex detectors. At the very high interaction rates expected at the LHC, the highest resolution elements of the inner detector (in this case pixel layers) are fundamental to identifying and disentangling collision vertices, identification of decay vertices of long-lived particles and for the tracking of charged particles. The Tsybychev group is involved in the R&D, design and construction of 3D pixel sensors ? a novel, powerful, and potentially robust technology for inner tracking. The third aspect is the participation of this group in the broader aspects of the MARIACHI project based at Brookhaven National Laboratory and SUNY Stony Brook. Here the excitement of particle physics at the Energy Frontier through the ATLAS experiment and the excitement of studying cosmic rays and the Cosmic Frontier through MARIACHI come together for high school teachers and students on Long Island."

0.83,"This award will provide support to a group of three PI's and an experienced senior faculty associate to work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC machine and ATLAS, a large particle detector facility, were built as basic science tools using funds from NSF and other agencies around the world. One of their primary objectives was to find the Higgs Boson, the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of, and forces between, known particles forming the matter in the universe. This effort has been successful. The next step in the experiments is to look for evidence for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that might, for instance, account for the presence of the mysterious ""Dark Matter"" that makes up so much of the mass of the universe. The LHC is about to begin run 2 at almost twice the energy ever explored in detail before. It is possible that particles from BSM could materialize at the higher energy. Two Higgs decay types, whose observation relies on techniques developed by this group, could provide the key to seeing BSM for the first time. <br/><br/>The investigators will continue to train their algorithms to search for decays of heavy neutral Higgs Bosons into tau+tau- lepton pairs. New algorithms will also be developed to compute the tau pair invariant mass (with two missing neutrinos). They will also search for long lived states seen to emanate from displaced vertices. The long-lived particle search will explore the use of boosted decision trees (BDT) to improve event selection sensitivity and ways of combining events in which the decays occur in ATLAS subsystems.

0.149104,"Overview: A goal of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (the LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland is to understand the nature of the Higgs Boson, recently discovered there in 2012, and to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics. These goals are relevant to the understanding of the Universe at its most fundamental level just in the fleeting fraction of a second just after the Big Bang, and to why we see the Universe as we do now. To meet the challenges of this quest, new theories are advanced, new detectors and accelerators are developed and built, and new computing and analytical methodologies are created, all of which have significant broader impact for the training of young scientists in the near term and the advancement of technological benefits to society over the longer term. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The emphasis here is on the involvement of undergraduate students directly into the research program. The student will work directly on physics analysis and visit the CERN laboratory. One of the highlights will be the development by the students of an undergraduate research journal at Manhattan College, a potentially exciting means to develop interest and enthusiasm among the students for scientific research. <br/><br/>The next three years represent a transition of the LHC physics program from a collision energy of 8 TeV data-taking and operation, to extended operations and data taking at nearly double the energy, 13-14 TeV. Over a thousand scientists from the United States are involved with this scientific program on several major experiments.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The research to be conducted under this award to Prof Konoplich and his group at Manhattan College is aimed to address deep questions about the nature of the Universe from data collected with the ATLAS experiment, one of the major multipurpose detectors at the LHC. Scientific questions addressed include: is the newly discovered Higgs particle simply the Higgs of the Standard Model or is it part of a larger theoretical picture that includes new particles that could be discovered at the new higher LHC collision energy? What are the detailed properties of this particle? Why is the observed mass of the Higgs boson so low, found to be 126 billion electron volts, or roughly 135 times the mass of the proton? In fact this low mass value is one of the most profound conundrums in all of science and is currently driving much of the scientific discourse in the field of particle physics. These questions are critical to our understanding of the full context of the Standard Model of particle physics and to new physics that lies beyond the Standard Model. <br/><br/>Technically, Konoplich and his group will be collaborating with colleagues at New York University and others in developing and refining the trigger for the ATLAS experiment, and notably the missing energy trigger, which is important for allowing the experiment to be sensitive to new physics. Such a development will be tactically important as the energy and the luminosity (the instantaneous collision rate) of the LHC are increased to meet the demands of the ATLAS program of discovery physics."
0.15,"The objective of this project is to search for physics that does not have an explanation in the Standard Model (SM), the theory that classifies all the known elementary particles.

This final state can probe many fundamental mysteries of the Universe, e.g. the nature of dark matter, the existence of extra dimensions, and the existence of an extended family of Higgs Bosons predicted by some theories beyond the SM. This group will also play a role in the planned upgrade of the ATLAS detector itself. They will work on the development and use of a device that uses silicon detectors to map out the paths of charged particles passing through. This award will support one PI, a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student. The PI will continue as a mentor in the U. Washington QuarkNet program, and will also work with high school students from local Seattle High Schools in the MasterClass program. He will also continue to organize events that bring results from the LHC closer to the public.<br/><br/>The group will focus on W/Z + large EtransT events in which the particle recoiling against the Boson is invisible and has large, missing transverse energy. Such events would signal the existence of massive neutral particles that could have a number of origins in a variety of theories that lie beyond the SM. The group will also work on data acquisition for use with the ATLAS inner tracker."
0.12,"This award provides support for a group with one PI, a senior colleague, a technician and two undergraduate students to work on a new kind of particle detector using a technology similar to that used in flat screen ""plasma"" television displays. These displays use small hermetically sealed cells containing a gas that can hold electric charge. In this application, the charge will be stimulated by the passage of charged particles passing through the gas cells and can be sensed electronically. The identity of which cells have been charged provides the spatial information on the particles. Preliminary tests suggest that it will be possible for these devices to detect particles in a billionth of a second and that cells can be made with a size of about one tenth of a millimeter. Using experience from commercial providers of flat screen televisions, it is hoped that these detectors can be larger and cheaper than the types in use in other particle physics instruments today. These detectors may find application in the medical or other communities interested in charged particle tracking. These and other particle physics applications will also be discussed in public dissemination. Basic skills in electronics and fabrication techniques will be passed along to undergraduates from U. Michigan State who have the opportunity to work on this project. The proposed R&D plan will allow the development, in three phases, of a prototype device performing at the design resolution of less than 100 micron (spatial) and 1 nanosecond (in time). This award covers the first part of this effort, the completion of the first two phases, providing a resolution of about a factor two (spatially) larger than this."
0.165,"This award supports a Career Award for the PI, a new assistant professor at Stanford U, to work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC machine and ATLAS, a large particle detector facility, were built as basic science tools using funds from NSF and other agencies around the world. One of the primary objectives of the LHC at the time of construction was to find the Higgs Boson - the last particle in the historically successful ""Standard Model"" (SM) that accounts for so much of the existence of and forces between known particles forming the visible matter in the universe. The search for the Higgs Boson was successful, so the discovery of the particles that lie within the realm of particle physics physics beyond the SM is now the goal. This award is for work that could lead to such a discovery by filtering out events with two Higgs Bosons in them.<br/><br/>Principal Investigator Lauren Tompkins is starting a new experimental high energy physics group at Stanford University which will pursue a number of software algorithms that, working with a new real time hardware track reconstruction module (the FTK), will lead to a greatly enriched sample of Higgs pair candidates. She will take primary roles within the collaboration to carry this out. The group will support a vigorous and carefully planned broader impact program through courses for Stanford students and also outreach to local schools. One of the principal aims is to increase enrollment in physics. She will also mentor under-privileged students from Cal State institutions during summer break. These students will obtain hands-on experience with both hardware and software."
0.17,"The objective of this project is to search for physics that does not have an explanation in the Standard Model (SM), the theory that describes the properties of the elementary particles making up the known matter in the universe. The work will be done using the ATLAS multi-particle detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Switzerland. In 2012 the Higgs boson (H) was discovered at the LHC by both ATLAS and CMS, another large detector at LHC. The Higgs boson was the last particle predicted to exist by the SM. In this project the PI and his group of scientists will use the LHC running at almost twice the energy achieved in 2012, 13 teraelectron volts (TeV) as opposed to 7.5 (TeV). The group will look for events in which an H decays to a fermion anti-fermion pair. (A fermion is an elementary particle that has a half-integer value of the fundamental property of all elementary particles known as spin. An electron, for example, is a fermion.) Details of such decays, such as the frequency with which they occur, can reveal whether or not other Higgs-like particles, predicted in various extensions of the SM, exist. The increased energy will also allow the group to search for further, more massive Higgs-like states. <br/><br/>The award will support one PI, a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student. The group will collect and analyze events from run II of the LHC, which begins in the summer of 2015 and continues through the end of 2017.The group will also play a role in the maintenance of the ATLAS tiled calorimeter system and the Fast TracKer trigger (FTK, part of the planned upgrade of the ATLAS detector designed to rapidly reconstruct data from the silicon-based charged particle detector system). Their analysis focus will be in the study of Higgs couplings to ff where the Fermions are from the 3rd generation (t, b, tau-nu)."
3,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond a dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.<br/><br/>This award will provide support for the design and fabrication of a next-generation (G2) experiment, SuperCDMS SNOLAB, which will operate at the deepest large clean underground laboratory in the world. The high background rejection and control of contamination that the SuperCDMS technology offers provide significant advantages compared to other technologies. The baseline design for this new experiment will deploy an initial 50 kg payload of germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) detectors. Some of these detectors will be operated in a manner that provides very low energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to the lowest dark matter particle masses (< 0.5 GeV) and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment. It will provide a strong possibility of the discovery of particle dark matter and detailed information on its properties.<br/><br/>This award will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies. SuperCDMS scientists will continue their involvement in public outreach, collaboration with K-12 teachers, and support for Berkeley physics majors who are training to teach science and for promising high school students from underserved backgrounds."

0.02,"Physical progress always proceeds on three fronts: observational/experimental, phenomenological--a coherent codifying of the data-- and finally, theoretical--finding a deeper understanding, through general laws, of those descriptions. The present rapid progress of both micro-, as witness the headline ""LHC"" results, and cosmo-scales, such as the newest ""Planck"" maps, puts welcome pressure on theory. Our work is on the ""deep"" theory side, attempting to find hints of possible generalizations of the ""standard model"", Einstein Gravity, that account for the deviations from its otherwise spectacular successes. Here we especially mean the apparent need for dark matter, which we hope to reduce to geometrical effects rather than by adding on Ptolemaic particles, without giving up the beauty of geometry. Thus, part of our efforts will be to continue our very recent results that exclude the currently popular ""massive Gravity"", because the latter loses all the beauty of geometry, instead unleashing too many variants and losing the tightness of geometrical description. Indeed, just as the Yang-Mills field theory counterparts of General Relativity were shown to exclude massive extensions, but relied instead on the now LHC-observed Higgs field, it looks as if the beautiful ""isolated"" nature of our basic interacting ""glue"" theories, Yang -Mills and Maxwell, will extend to gravity as well. On the constructive side, we intend to look for--less fundamental ""effective"", non-local but still geometrical, laws that replace the fuzziness of dark matter by additional terms that exploit the freedom remaining in the ""Einstein"" picture. <br/><br/>In more accessible terms, let us place our efforts within the present framework of front-line Physics, one that has received much recent media attention both in the Laboratory--especially the discovery of the ""Higgs"" field at the LHC accelerator, and at the opposite end of our universe-- by for example the newest spectacular pictures presented by the Planck, and other Cosmic observatories, of our entire Universe as it looked a mere third of a million years into its expansion the its present 13 billion. Our aim is to understand such general features of our world by--as conservative as possible--extensions of Einstein's General Relativity to account for Dark Matter and other unexpected new large-scale features. The conservative part of our program is to exclude candidates that go too far, by violating the (by now familiar) picture of curved space that General Relativity presents. So our twofold approach keeps a tight rein on that good, ""geometrical"", part of our hard-won picture of the Universe, while extending its reach within this realm, in particular by exploring different ways in which matter and geometry can interact there. We may be sure that the observational surprises will stay ahead of our inventive abilities, but that's the bootstrap that always works, and illuminates our world!"
0.115,"An isolated neutron lives for about fifteen minutes before disintegrating into three lighter particles. This fundamental process plays a significant role in cosmology, and its study complements current efforts to discover new physics. Two laboratory techniques exist to determine the lifetime of a neutron with high precision, but they disagree significantly in their reported values. This discrepancy must be addressed in order to realize the potential of these techniques to help probe new physics. The research conducted with this award directly supports that effort by examining the behavior of very low energy (or ""ultracold"") neutrons which are magnetically confined in order to determine the neutron lifetime. The research involves a broad set of ideas and skills appropriate for undergraduate involvement and will be used to form the kernel for an interdisciplinary undergraduate research training, mentoring, and outreach program at Tennessee Technological University. <br/><br/>Research activities will be carried out in conjunction with the UCNtau collaboration, which has constructed a magneto-gravitational ultracold neutron trap with a long intrinsic neutron storage time and demonstrated a detection strategy capable of making multiple high-precision measurements in a single accelerator cycle at the Los Alamos National Laboratory ultracold neutron source. Losses due to spin evolution in this trap will be empirically characterized by developing a high-fidelity spin-tracking Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment which, when combined with measurements of the mean trap lifetime as a function of the polarization-preserving ambient magnetic field magnitude, will be used to characterize indirectly the loss rate associated with spin evolution in the trap, sufficient for completing measurement of the neutron lifetime to an accuracy of one second. Measurements in a dedicated test cell will provide information necessary to assess directly the effect of spin evolution in a very high-precision (well below 0.1%) magnetic trap measurement of the free neutron lifetime."

0.15,"In the late 1800s, flash photography enabled the motion of macroscopic objects to be slowed to the point where the true order of events could be extracted. Nearly a century later, femtosecond pulses (1 femtosecond is one millionth of one billionth of a second) enabled the motions of atoms to be frozen during the formation and breakup of molecules, resulting in an improved microscopic picture of chemistry. The advent of attosecond pulses, a million times shorter, allows the motion of the tiniest building block of matter, the electron, to be stopped in its tracks. Professors Chang, of the University of Central Florida, and Hill, of the University of Maryland, together with their students, use attosecond laser pulses to study electronic charge dynamics on timescales commensurate with its indigenous motion in atomic and molecular systems. Charge migration, as it is known, is central to a variety of important processes such as photosynthesis, radiation damage in biomolecules and photovoltaics used in solar panels. This collaborative project is providing insight into the collective and interactive motion of electrons that are ubiquitous in atoms, molecules and solids. An improved understanding of charge migration will have broad application from controlling the flow of energy within a molecule to tailoring the performance of materials to specific needs.<br/><br/>Photoinduced charge separation in molecules is the first step in many chemical processes and central to our understanding of electron correlation and the energy exchange between electronic and nuclear motion responsible for catalysis, photosynthesis, photovoltaics and radiation damage in biomolecules. Comprehensive numerical simulations of complex molecules predict that when an electron is 'suddenly' removed from one end of a chain molecule, such as a small peptide, the hole can move to the other end of the molecule in less than 10 fs, before the electron-nuclear coupling takes place. Intense, isolated attosecond pulses are required to study this naturally-occurring charge migration. Professors Chang and Hill, in a collaborative project between the University of Central Florida (UCF) and the University of Maryland (UMD), exploit the attosecond source at UCF to investigate charge migration in multi-electron atoms (He) and multi-atom molecules (SO2) via attosecond pump - attosecond probe experiments. The pump pulse initiates rapid excitation (in the absence of nuclear motion in the molecular case) while the probe pulse monitors the ensuing charge migration. Two probe techniques are used to 'watch' the charge migration: transient absorption and photoelectron angular distribution. In distinction with previous attosecond studies, where charge migration was investigated in the presence of a strong external infrared field, the UCF-UMD study is probing charge migration subsequent to excitation but in the absence of any external perturbation. As a consequence, this project is providing a clearer understanding of charge separation, energy flow and electron-nuclear charge coupling, which, as stated above, are relevant to a variety of processes associated with chemical reactions, dynamics in condensed matter systems and biological phenomena. A secondary goal of this project is the development of general experimental tools that can be transferred to more complicated systems, such as ABCU (1-azabicyclo [3.3.3] undecane), for which theoretical predictions exist and the excitation spectra fall near those of the model systems of this study."
0.114111,"This project seeks to engage stakeholders from the branches of science represented by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate at the NSF -- astronomy, chemistry, materials research, mathematics and physics -- into an active dialogue aimed at making publicly available the results of scientific research sponsored by NSF. Scientists with a broad variety of expertise will come together for a series of workshops to discuss the possibilities of scientific and educational reuse of data (which data is useful and what should be preserved?), the cyberinfrastructure needs for making data publicly available (what data access methods are required, what sort of accompanying metadata will be needed for easy access, and what are the parameters of the necessary archival storage?) and the commonality aspects of public access (how much of the existing infrastructure can serve multiple disciplines?) The answers to these questions are expected to be discipline dependent, but promoting a dialogue between communities is necessary in order to identify best practices and cost-effective solutions to serve the community needs and to help pave the way to a world with broad public access to scientific data.<br/><br/>Making research data broadly available opens the scientific enterprise to citizen scientists and other researchers and enhances the potential for discovery. Recognizing that the transition from the Digital Age to the Big Data Age provides also the technical means needed to make public the research data from a wide variety of scientific inquiries, the workshops supported by this project will work towards a framework by which public access can be accomplished. Economies of scale are expected by combining projects and infrastructure across various disciplines. As such, this effort will identify new opportunities for interdisciplinary research by emphasizing the dataset and metadata interoperability in the design of archival systems."
0.84,"The research program at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory focuses on timely topics in nuclear spectroscopy and neutron-induced reactions. Much of this work utilizes nearly monoenergetic fast neutrons and is reliant on the radiation detection capabilities we have developed. Our broad-based research includes selected studies in several forefront areas: nuclear structure relevant to double-beta decay and the mass of the neutrino, nuclei undergoing shape transitions, the decays of collective nuclear excitations, deformed nuclear structures and shape coexistence, nuclear structure contributions in support of searches for fundamental symmetries. The determination of nuclear level lifetimes in the femtosecond regime provides crucial information in many of these investigations. Additional projects that are particularly appropriate to the capabilities available in our laboratory are pursued, and collaborative research with colleagues from other institutions is a vital component of our program.<br/><br/>Education at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels continues as the nexus of all activities in our laboratory, and graduates are trained nuclear scientists who are capable of making important contributions in meeting our national needs. Providing a supportive professional experience for students is an ongoing, vital component of our program, and students enthusiastically participate in experiments at other facilities, scientific conferences, and the activities of professional societies. Research at a small accelerator laboratory, such as ours, permits hands-on experience for students, and these young scientists are mentored on a daily basis. For many years, the research facilities of our laboratory have been made available to students and faculty from non-doctoral-granting institutions, as well as scientists from other research universities, national laboratories, and nuclear-related industry. Research performed in our laboratory has contributed directly to addressing areas of national need, such as homeland security and the design of advanced nuclear reactors, and will continue to do so. These applications are well represented by the activities of government and industrial partners who utilize our accelerator and research equipment. For example, collaborative studies with colleagues from industry have led to improved neutron-detection-based methods for the inspection of luggage for explosives and illegal drugs, and data obtained in our laboratory has been used to evaluate direct energy-storage devices. In each case, the unique capabilities of our laboratory were important considerations in the selection of our facility for this work."
0.368223,"This project focuses on systems that allow one weak light pulse to control another weak light pulse. The motivation for these systems ranges from practical applications (such as low-power ""switches"" that route light pulses through optical communication networks), to fundamental issues in quantum physics. The experimental research is based on a promising new platform comprised of small-scale devices (waveguides) that steer tiny beams of light through atomic vapors. The knowledge created from this research will impact a number of different areas in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and the project centers on training the next generation of scientists through extensive graduate and undergraduate student involvement in the research. <br/><br/>The specific systems being pursued involve the use of sub-wavelength diameter tapered optical fibers surrounded by atomic vapors, and small hollow-core photonic bandgap fibers filled with atomic vapors. In both cases, strong nonlinearities are enabled by waveguiding a tightly confined optical mode over a long distance through the atomic medium. The use of metastable xenon (an inert noble gas) as the atomic vapor overcomes major limitations imposed by the earlier use of rubidium (a reactive alkali atom). The enhanced nonlinearities in these xenon-based waveguide systems will allow the realization of new types of research on quantum entanglement and non-classical state generation."

0.2333,"This collaborative research project, consisting of four institutions (Rice, Yale, UIUC and Princeton) aims to continue the Physics of Living Systems Student Research Network (PoLS SRN). This network has been in existence for four years and has had a dramatic impact on many graduate students, both in the US and abroad, working on the application of physical science techniques to living systems. These students now can participate in a global community that can help deal with the many complex issues involved in conducting research in such a new and inherently multidisciplinary field. These issues range from proper training, to gaining a broad perspective, to accessing technical expertise that may not be available at their home institution. In addition to the obvious broader impacts related to training of a research workforce, there are other broad impacts of this plan. Via the interaction of one of the PoLS nodes (Rice) with the biomedical community in Houston, students and faculty will be exposed to possible avenues whereby physics can contribute to human health issues. Funds to attract students from under-represented groups to network meetings will be available through the new funds administered by the newly proposed network coordinator. Also deas vetted by the PoLS SRN will be adapted to create student networks in other areas of science and engineering.<br/><br/>There is by now little disagreement with the general notion that concepts and methods from physics have been a critical contributor to the increased understanding of the living world, and that its importance will be growing as the scientific world moves toward an ever more quantitative and predictive form of biology. Thus, the physics community clearly needs to train a new generation of scientists who can lead this effort, scientists who have the right mix of physics/mathematics rigor and broad knowledge of living systems from molecular scales on up. The PoLS SRN aims at creating a community of graduate students who can collectively help themselves and their mentors accelerate and enhance this training process. This is being done by a mix of in-person and virtual modes of communication, and this proposal is a plan to continue and expand these efforts; it will reach more students, improve the social networking portals, and make use of the complementary research agendas of the different network nodes to provide broad technical expertise. Doing all of this, will boost the intellectual level of the entire research field and convince the best students that the Physics of Living Systems is truly the most exciting research frontier in 21st century science.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics, the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry, and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems."

0.132228,"Epidermal growth factor gradient sensing by epithelial cells is a crucial process in development and many disease processes such as cancer metastasis. Understanding the basic principles of this sensing would enable us to intervene in disease processes that involve directional cell motion by pharmacologically targeting the communication rather than the within-cell regulation, and it can stimulate a novel direction for therapeutics. Through a combination of novel experimental and theoretical approaches, this project will characterize advantages and limitations of multicellular gradient sensing in breast epithelial tissue in a mouse model. It will explore the fundamental physical limits on collective gradient sensing and will establish to which extent the size of multicellular ensembles aids their sensory precision. The project will also support synergistic curriculum development efforts on the interface of physics and biology at three research universities, on levels from introductory undergraduate to advanced graduate. It will provide research and broader career training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, including minority students. The PIs will engage elementary school students in science projects and they will reach out to the general public disseminating their research findings at the Atlanta Science Festival.<br/><br/>Cells in multicellular organisms rarely act alone in responding to external signals, but little is known about behaviors that emerge from their multicellular, collective communication and action. In particular it is unknown if multicellular ensembles can collectively sense chemical gradients in ways that take advantage of such ensembles spanning substantial ranges of the chemo-attractant concentration. The PIs' experiments with multicellular ensembles of breast epithelial cells exposed to gradients of epidermal growth factor suggest that these cells can sense gradients collectively and that collectively cells respond to gradients that are far smaller than those sensed by individual cells. This multicellular information processing is fundamentally distinct from, and not simply reducible to, sensory processes in isolated cells. The PIs will establish theoretically and verify experimentally the fundamental physical limits on the precision of gradient sensing by multicellular ensembles. These limits containing contributions from the extrinsic ligand stochasticity and from the intrinsic noise in communicating the measurements made by distant cells in a multicellular group to individual cells within the group will be characterized. The PIs will develop computational methods to analyze precision of biological information processing in collective, nonlinear phenomena, such as epithelial tissue rearrangement, which will be applicable broadly in other biophysical contexts."
0.36084,"Chemical signals from a cell's environment can induce motion of that cell. This phenomenon, called chemotaxis, in the E. coli bacteria is one of the most extensively studied biological response. The E. coli chemotaxis network has become a paradigm for cellular behavior and signal transduction pathways and in this project the PI aims to understand signaling and behavior in E. coli considering them in the context of their function and the specific challenges they have evolved to address. The current experimental project is motivated by a recent theoretical work by the PI, which applies advanced tools of statistical physics to such biological problems. In the proposed experiments, a chemotaxis assay of a new type will be specially built to test those key predictions of the new theory. This project has the potential to change a widely accepted part of the paradigm of E.coli chemotaxis and possibly change the perspective on directed motion of other cells and organisms. The study synergistically combines theoretical analysis, innovative microfluidic technology, microbiology and molecular biology techniques, quantitative experiments with cells, and advanced microscopy and data analysis. The PI and Co-PI have complementary areas of expertise and have known each other for more than a decade from their previous work on mixing in chaotic and turbulent flows. Graduate students will be trained in cross-disciplinary environment and benefit from the synergism of the two groups involved in the proposed project with their complementary areas of expertise. The PIs will also continue to be involved in education, instruction and training that closely interface with the proposed work. <br/><br/>The project is an experimental study of the role of adaptation in chemotaxis of Escherichia coli in different types of gradients of chemo-attractants and of adaptation in aerotaxis and pH-taxis of E. coli. A remarkable feature of E. coli chemotaxis is the perfect adaptation to changes in the concentration of aspartate, a commonly used attractant. The response of E. coli to a short-term change in aspartate concentration has asymmetric positive and negative lobes, with the integral equal to zero. The proposed experimental study is driven by a recent theoretical analysis by the PI, showing that the main advantage of the perfect adaptation is optimal navigation through environments with time-varying, complex spatial distributions of nutrients. Environments of this type are likely to be present in liquid E. coli cultures at the entry to the stationary phase, where E. coli motility is at its maximum. This analysis represents an alternative to a common narrative that the main function of the perfect adaptation is the retention of sensitivity to shallow gradients over a broad range of background concentrations. The theoretical predictions will be tested with a two-pronged experimental approach. First, chemotaxis of freely swimming wild-type and mutated E. coli will be studied in static linear profiles of attractants, for which the perfect adaptation is predicted to be non-optimal. Therefore, perfectly adapted E. coli are expected to have lower chemotactic efficiency than some of imperfectly adapted E. coli. Second, E. coli chemotaxis will be studied in a custom-built microfluidic device, which creates time-varying spatially non-uniform gradients of attractants. Based on the theory, the perfectly adapted E. coli are expected to outperform all competitors, securing highest average concentrations of the attractant along their swimming trajectories. The experiments will be facilitated by a technique recently developed by the PI that extracts temporal responses from trajectories of freely swimming cells. The proposed study will also apply this technique to the analysis directed motion of E. coli in well-defined gradients of oxygen and pH in a microfluidic device recently built by the Co-PI."

Potential research topics include: magnetic reconnection, turbulence, and nonlinear phenomena in plasmas; chaos and synchronism in large systems of network-coupled components; dynamics of granular and soft-matter flow; development of singularities in fluids and solids; nonlinear dynamics in optical systems and charged particle beams; autonomous control of vehicles with forecast uncertainty; and nonlinear physics of living systems. Two weekly seminar series will complement and reinforce the learning experience. The first seminar series will expose students to state-of-the-art research in nonlinear science at a level appropriate for undergraduates. The second seminar series will focus on research skills development, including critical reading of research papers, oral and written communication, and preparation for graduate school. Students will give oral presentations and participate in a poster session on the final day of the program, and funding will be provided to all students to subsequently present their work at a relevant national or regional conference."
0.036,"Physics Theorynet is an outreach program supported by the National Science Foundation and coordinated by the Principal Investigators since 2003. The main component of Theorynet activities is direct interaction between Boston area theorists and high school students, through lecture presentations, demonstrations, and question and answer sessions conducted during regular class hours and after classes. Presentation topics may include science in the news (such as dark energy, the Large Hadron Collider, or exoplanets), traditional subjects of interest to young science students (such as black holes, timetravel, or extra dimensions), or concepts related to the high school physics curriculum. The program aims to increase students' understanding of science and to raise their awareness of the importance of fundamental research. In particular the Theorynet program seeks to stress the importance of teaching what is referred to as the ""nature of science"" (NOS). Very briefly, NOS can be described as the notion that the acquisition of scientific knowledge is a collective, human enterprise which proceeds through an evolving framework of models for the physical world. Recent research indicates that students will not adequately understand NOS unless it is deliberately introduced into the curriculum. Specifically, students will not come to appreciate the true nature of science simply by learning the body of knowledge commonly taught in high school curricula. Therefore, the Physics Theorynet outreach program seeks to deliver instruction about NOS to high school students in the Boston metropolitan area.<br/><br/>Faculty participants in the Theorynet program come from universities such as MIT, Harvard, Tufts, Boston University, Brandeis, Rhode Island College and the University of New Hampshire, in addition to Northeastern University. High school instructors in the Theorynet program represent a diversified cross-section of public and private schools in urban, suburban and rural areas, with fifteen high schools currently represented across three states. Operational costs of the Theorynet program include a nominal stipend for high school instructors who participate, compensation for the travel that instructors undertake to attend program meetings, acquisition and maintenance of lecture demonstrations and presentation equipment, and advertising at regional events aimed at physics instructors.<br/><br/>It is estimated that 2,000 students are reached by Theorynet physicists each year, in a diversified cross-section of public and private schools in urban, suburban and rural areas. The program is highly appreciated by teachers, students and their parents. Students have had negative pre-conceived notions of science professionals corrected by direct interaction with university faculty. Students are often encouraged to learn that even some fanciful speculations can find a home in theoretical physics, where there truly are ""no dumb questions."" Concepts such as string theory or the Higgs mechanism are de-mystified, and the importance of fundamental science as a vocation is re-affirmed. There is even a broader impact on Boston area communities due to the coverage in high school and local newspapers, as well as to students reporting visits to their parents. A major component of the Theorynet program is promoting physics as a field of study when high school students go on to college, and suggesting theoretical physics as a plausible long-term career goal for students."
0.268,"This renewal grant provides continued funding for TASI, the annual Theoretical Advanced Study Institutes in Elementary Particle Physics, currently under the direction of Professors K.T. Mahanthappa and T. deGrand at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The four-week long TASI summer programs have been held every year since 1984. The aim of TASI is to introduce advanced graduate students to a much broader range of ideas and topics than they normally experience in their home institutions while working on their dissertation topics. TASI has been highly successful in achieving this by providing a series of lectures and seminars on topics of current research in theoretical particle physics and related experimental subjects. Indeed, during their nearly 30-year history, the TASI summer programs have become a major educational experience and indeed an eagerly anticipated ""rite of passage"" for literally generations of high-energy theory graduate students. Moreover, since 2007, the TASI lectures have been video-recorded and are accessible online. These video tapes form an important ""broader impacts"" outreach component of TASI, and have become increasingly valuable to the entire high-energy physics research community. Students attending TASI also have the opportunity to present seminars on their current research to their peers."
0.38,"Quantum spins associated with defects in diamond (Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers) can be used to sense magnetic fields with an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and spatial resolution. These novel sensors could elucidate the structure and dynamics of materials and biomolecules at the nano-scale and ambient conditions. A critical ingredient to the success of these sensors is the understanding of their environment (composed of other diamond spin defects) that usually spoil their properties. The focus of this project is not only to understand the interaction of Nitrogen-Vacancy centers with their spin environment, but also to turn these spins into a resource. This goal will be accomplished by studying the environmental spin properties and dynamics and by developing control techniques to manipulate and measuring them. In turns, a better understanding of the spin system and novel control techniques will yield improved quantum devices for sensing and bio-imaging. In addition, the ability to explore spin dynamics at the nano-scale, a possibility opened by the use of Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, will advance the knowledge of this complex, many-body non-equilibrium quantum phenomenon and have impact in broader disciplines, including quantum computation and MRI. This project will support the training of graduate student researchers in an exciting and multidisciplinary research field. <br/><br/>This research program will explore fundamental physics and potential applications of spin polarization at the nanoscale, with a synergistic interplay between theory and experiment. The project exploits the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a seed and sensor of local spin polarization in the surrounding electronic and nuclear spin environment. The goals are to first achieve efficient polarization buildup via optical cooling of the NV center and its thermal contact with the spin bath; and second, to investigate the subsequent dynamics (polarization transport) in the mesoscopic spin environment. Thanks to high spatial resolution of NV detection and to novel material engineering techniques, these phenomena on single-spin systems, will be able to be studied at the nano-meter scale. The intellectual merit of the program lies in elucidating, via experiments and theoretical models, the phenomenon of spin diffusion, investigating scales not previously accessible to conventional magnetic resonance techniques. Spin diffusion is a complex quantum many-body process, which underlies, for example, decoherence in magnetic resonance experiments as well as dynamic polarization. In addition, by using engineered materials, how to promote coherent spin transport between distant NV centers, mediated by a quasi-one dimensional bath of electronic spins, will be studied. These studies will have a broader impact in different disciplines, from quantum computation and metrology, to protein sensing via dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Electronic spins in diamond can be used as spin wires to transfer quantum information between quantum registers located at the NV centers. A polarized spin bath can be used to improve quantum metrology via NV centers, by achieving longer coherence time and Heisenberg-limited sensitivity via the creation of an entangled state. Novel insight into spin diffusion -especially at the spin diffusion barrier- would lead to improved strategies for DNP, a popular technique in protein structure determination with NMR. Hyper-polarized nano-diamonds could themselves be used as polarizing agents, dissolved in bio-samples of interest for improved sensitivity."
0.53,"This work involves research and education on a set of topics in atomic physics and quantum optics. The main objective of the project is to develop new methods for the generation, storage, and distribution of quantum mechanical entanglement utilizing photons and ultra-cold atoms. The approach employs interactions of ultra-cold atoms excited into Rydberg states for entanglement generation while ground atomic levels are used for information storage. The strength of the atom-light interactions will be increased by placing the atoms between highly polished mirrors of an optical cavity, while confining the atoms to laser-generated optical lattices and cooling them to ultra-low temperatures. The planned activity is expected to result in the development of a new generation of capabilities for the creation, distribution and storage of entangled quantum states and contribute to future implementations of distributed quantum computing. Additionally, efficient production of massively entangled states will advance quantum-enhanced technologies. <br/><br/>This research will continue a program of investigating the generation, storage, and distribution of quantum information, using individual photons and trapped ultra-cold atoms. The entanglement of spin-wave hyperfine qubits to optical qubits encoded in the polarization, spatial or frequency degrees of freedom of single photons, as well as entanglement of two remote spin-wave qubits, and single-photon wavelength conversion between the near-infrared and the telecom has been previously demonstrated. Most recently, quantum memory times have been extended beyond 10 seconds, while strong interactions of atomic Rydberg levels have been employed for the generation of single photons, many-body quantum states, and matter-light entanglement. This opens a path toward functional quantum networking architectures of superior scaling. The following set of goals will be explored: (i) tight, three-dimensional, state-insensitive confinement of ground and Rydberg atoms; (ii) Rydberg quantum gates between qubits encoded in Rubidium isotopic mixtures; (iii) scalable multi-qubit atomic entangled states by sequential generation of entangled qubit pairs and triples, photon interferences and light-memory quantum state mappings; (iv) storage of multi-qubit entangled quantum states with second-scale lifetimes. The planned activity will expedite the development of a new generation of capabilities for the creation, distribution and storage of multi-qubit entangled states and contributes to future implementations of long-distance quantum repeaters and distributed quantum computing. Moreover efficient production of multi-qubit entangled states will impact fundamental physics investigations and advance quantum-enhanced technologies."
0.26,"In a quantum network, information is transmitted and processed using quantum mechanical objects called qubits. This revolutionary computational paradigm enables unprecedented information processing capabilities such as unbreakable cryptographic codes and exponential speedup of computational tasks. To achieve these remarkable capabilities requires the ability to both store qubits and create qubit-qubit interactions over long distances. Trapped spins in solids offer a remarkable system for storing quantum information, but these spins cannot easily interact with each other unless they are in close proximity. Photons provide a promising solution to this problem because they can be transmitted over long distances to create effective interactions between spins that are separated by long distances. However, long distance communication requires photons at optical frequencies while spins usually have resonances in the microwave frequency ranges. Because of this large frequency mismatch, photons typically don't interact with spins. In this project, the group will use optical cavities strongly coupled to a single spin trapped in a quantum dot to solve this problem. Cavities can create a strong effective spin-photon interface by enhancing light-matter interactions. These enhanced interactions open up the possibility for optical frequency photons to couple spins separated by long distances for quantum networks. The group will demonstrate photon mediated spin interactions using quantum dots coupled to optical cavities. Quantum dots are nanoscale structures that behave as artificial atoms. A quantum dot can capture an additional charge that behaves as a trapped spin qubit. By strongly coupling the quantum dot to a cavity, the group will develop a device called a quantum transistor, which forms the basic building block for complex quantum networks. Methods to utilize this device to implement quantum logic operations over long distances will be explored. These results could ultimately enable chip-integrated solid-state quantum devices that form the building blocks for long distance quantum networks.<br/><br/>A novel approach to spin-based quantum information processing where photons mediate effective spin-spin interactions will be developed. The fundamental building block for this approach is the spin-photon quantum transistor, which enables a single spin quantum bit (qubit) to apply quantum logic operations on a photon. This spin-photon transistor will be realized using a charged indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dot in a photonic crystal cavity. The charged dot contains an additional electron or hole that provides a spin degree of freedom with long coherence times. By coupling the quantum dot to a photonic crystal cavity, it is possible to attain a strong light-matter interface where the state of the spin modulates the cavity spectrum. This work will attain a better scientific understanding of the system and underlying decoherence mechanisms, and address practical device design and fabrication challenges for creating a scalable quantum architecture. This will provide a unique approach to spin-based quantum information processing that have many important advantages including the ability to couple arbitrary spins, implement gate operations on ultra-fast timescales, and create effective interactions over long distances for quantum networking. Novel devices that could enable quantum information processing in a chip-integrated device that is compact and scalable will be investigated. Major device design and fabrication challenges will be addressed that are crucial for scalable implementation including optimizing light-matter interactions in photonic crystals and aligning quantum dots spatially and spectrally with resonator modes. This could provide a direct pathway for developing highly compact and scalable quantum information processing on a semiconductor chip. This capability would have a revolutionary impact on information technology, enabling exponential faster computation, unconditionally secure communication, and high precision sensors that operate far below the classical noise limit. The devices developed could have major impact in other fields such as opto-electronics, nonlinear optics, and spintronics. In addition to the proposed research effort, the research program will support training of graduate and undergraduate students, and develop an outreach program to create interdisciplinary research opportunities for local high school students."
0.22,"In principle, quantum computers can use the physics of atoms and molecules to perform calculations ranging from code-breaking to simulation of materials algorithmically faster than any conventional supercomputer. The main challenge for building a quantum computer is that quantum components are prone to error. Error correction can be used to overcome this challenge but it places stringent requirements on future quantum computer hardware. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path for bridging the gap between current physical hardware and large-scale quantum algorithms. Specifically we will examine how a state-of-the-art quantum error correction scheme, the surface code, behaves when mapped to realistic physical architectures. If successful, this research will help experimentalists build the first universal scalable quantum computer. The research will train graduate students and undergraduate students in the growing field of quantum information science and provide them with an opportunity to work with our industrial collaborators at IBM. <br/><br/>This proposal expands the frontiers of physics by exploring quantum computation at the intersection of experimental devices, computer architecture, and quantum information theory. Surface codes with a computational error threshold of 1% are a promising solution to the problem of decoherence and imperfections in quantum systems. Computation is performed by the creation, annihilation, and braiding of topological defects. Examining this process from the perspective of algorithms and architectures will help reveal common structures and provide a precise method for implementation of these ideas on real physical systems. We will explore surface code implementations that account for realistic noise models and system-level constraints. Our work will leverage our previous work in experimental device data, quantum circuit synthesis tools, computer architecture, and quantum programming languages and compilers. Additionally, we will collaborate closely with Sergey Bravyi at IBM (including summer internships at IBM for our students) on the theoretical foundations of this work."
0.25,"The project ""Complexity of Simulating Quantum Adiabatic Optimization by Quantum Monte Carlo Methods"" investigates the computational power and weaknesses of a widely used method for simulating quantum physics. The Quantum Monte Carlo method is a commonly used algorithm for analyzing and simulating large, coherent quantum systems. Although it is known that this method can not efficiently simulate all quantum mechanical systems, it is also known to provide reliable answers for a large subclass of such systems. The project focuses on the specific question whether or not a quantum computer running the Quantum Adiabatic Optimization algorithm is efficiently simulatable by the Quantum Monte Carlo method.  <br/><br/>The theory of quantum computation looks at the question which problems can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer that do not have an efficient solution using classical computation. An important case of this theory concerns Quantum Adiabatic Optimization, which is a general purpose quantum algorithm that attempts to find the optimal value in an exponentially large landscape of function values. Despite more than 12 years of study, it is still not known to which extend this quantum heuristic performs better than classical heuristics. On the one hand, it is possible that a classical algorithm that uses the Quantum Monte Carlo method will be able to efficiently simulate quantum adiabatic optimization, which would prove a strong limitation on the 'quantum benefit' of the quantum adiabatic approach to solving optimization problems. On the other hand, it is also possible that one can prove that the Quantum Monte Carlo method does not succeed in efficiently mimicking the quantum adiabatic algorithm, thus providing strong evidence that quantum adiabatic optimization does indeed have computational powers that go beyond classical computation. This project aims to determine which one of these two possibilities is the case. Research in quantum computation is high interdisciplinary with impacts in a number of areas of physics and computer science. In addition, this project will support the education and training of a graduate student in this cross-disciplinary research."

0.105293,"Many of the most important phenomena in the field of quantum information involve spatially separated quantum subsystems. These subsystems may be entangled, correlated in a way that cannot be explained within classical physics. All subsystems can communicate classical information with each other (LOCC, for local operations and classical communication). Important examples of such protocols include entanglement generation and manipulation, quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution and cryptography, and certain proposed implementations of quantum computing. A formal mathematical description applicable in general to these situations is known to be rather complex and difficult. Therefore, it is an important open problem to fully understand the LOCC class of measurements, but progress along these lines has been limited up to the present time. One important step will be to understand how LOCC differs from the larger class of separable measurements. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigator (PI) has recently devised a novel method of determining whether or not a separable quantum measurement can be implemented by LOCC. If it can, the approach devises an LOCC protocol which does so. If successful, the proposed work will extend this result to further understand how LOCC differs from separable measurements, and will also address important questions about LOCC itself, such as whether it is possible to bound the amount of communication needed at each round. The aim will also be to extend the PI's recent results on LOCC measurements to what is known as quantum operations, where the concern is only about the overall statistics that emerge from all the outcomes taken together. The proposed work will also contribute to our understanding about the creation of entanglement between two spatially separated systems, in part as an extension of the PI's recent results on the capacity of a bipartite unitary operation to create entanglement. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The PI has long been involved in undergraduate and graduate education, and his involvement in research has improved the quality of his teaching and deepened his interactions with students, contributing to education at both undergraduate and graduate levels through the PI's supervision of undergraduates in research projects and collaboration with graduate students. The PI is a frequent seminar speaker to a quantum information seminar series at a local university.

0.641963,"Atoms (the particles that constitutes ordinary matter) and light interact with each other through absorption and emission of photons (individual quanta or particles of light). Such atom-photon interactions constitute one of the most basic processes in physical science, and underlie many everyday phenomena as well as many device applications in areas such as optoelectronics. Most of these processes and devices involve large numbers of atoms and intense beams of light, since the interaction between single atoms and single photons are typically negligibly weak. The interaction can be made substantial if one builds a system in which an atom interacts with light confined in a very small space. Such strong atom-photon interactions lead to many new phenomena that not only deepen our understanding of nature, but may also form the basis of future technologies. These include novel transistors based on individual photons interacting with each other, novel states of matter in which atoms and photons are intertwined with one another, and robust quantum information systems that enable advances such as secure communication over long distances and ultra-precise quantum sensors. The present research program will explore new physics by using precisely engineered hybrid systems that combine nanoscale solid structures for confining light with well-isolated atoms and ""atom-like"" features (color centers) in solids.<br/><br/>Specifically, the present project aims at (1) understanding interactions between ultra-cold atoms and solid-state atom-like systems with photons confined to sub-wavelength photonic and plasmonic structures, (2) creating and controlling non-classical states of light and, (3) manipulating multi-atom quantum dynamics within hybrid quantum systems of increasing complexity. The project will also explore new theoretical approaches that focus on quantum dynamics of strongly interacting photons and atoms, with emphasis on using coherent and dissipative mechanisms to control quantum many-body states. The proposed effort will not only create new hybrid systems where many ideas of quantum optics can be realized, tested, and refined, but also lay the groundwork for a number of applications, ranging from realizations of robust quantum information systems and quantum optical circuits operating at the single photon level to the development of nanoscale sensors for studying complex systems. The principal investigators will also continue to develop new and efficient ways for disseminating physics knowledge through teaching, collaborations, review articles, lecture notes, organization of workshops and summer schools.

0.25,"Entanglement is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. For instance, if two identical particles can each be in either state A or B, they can be in an entangled state AA+BB, which means that the particles are in a superposition of both being in A or both being in B, but never one in A and the other in B. These highly non-classical states are central to the working of quantum computers. To date, proto-quantum computers have been made with up to 14 quantum bits (qubits), but their outputs can be readily reproduced with classical computers. As entangled states become increasingly complex they can no longer be modeled on classical computers. A quantum computer with more than 50 qubits could solve certain kinds of problems that are otherwise unsolvable.<br/><br/>Quantum computing is being pursued using several different types of qubits, including ions, superconducting Josephson junctions, quantum dots, photons, nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds, and neutral atoms. Each candidate qubit has its strengths and weakness. Neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices can be well-isolated from their environment, so they have relatively long coherence times, an essential qubit feature. Trapping them with light presents a relatively straightforward path to scalability well beyond 50 qubits. Still, there has been less work on trapped neutral atoms than on most other qubit candidates. The work proposed here is directed toward developing neutral atoms for quantum computation.<br/><br/>Experimental techniques needed for a neutral atom quantum computer will be developed. Previously atoms in a 5 micron spaced 3D optical lattice have been trapped and cooled, with an atom at half the sites. Using accurate site occupancy maps and the ability to address individual sites within a 5×5×5 site volume, a procedure to arbitrarily sort the atoms within that volume will be executed. For instance, perfectly occupied 3×3×3 cubes and 5×5 planes will be created. Since the atoms can be cooled to near their vibrational ground state after sorting, the sorting procedure can be checked and small errors corrected if need be, giving an ideal starting point for a quantum computation.<br/><br/>A new technique for measuring the internal states of a neutral atom qubit without atom loss by coherently splitting atoms based on their internal states, and then locking them in place with a shorter length scale optical lattice will be demonstrated. They can then be reliably detected in this new lattice, where their location encodes their initial internal state. A new type of single qubit microwave gate where atoms do not need to leave their storage basis will be demonstrated, which promises exceptionally high fidelity. Also work will continue to demonstrate two-qubit Rydberg gates, taking advantage of the low temperature of the atoms and the associated excellent localization. After all these techniques are developed, the system will allow for the implementation of ~3000 gates on 25 atoms before any atom loss is expected. This would constitute a sufficient proof of principle of scalability in neutral atom systems to stimulate further work in error correction and scaling in these systems."
0.105,"The development of quantum information technology promises to revolutionize both fundamental and applied science. For example, on the fundamental side, we expect that quantum devices will efficiently simulate poorly understood quantum mechanical theories, providing insight into their behavior. On the applied side, such simulations would allow for the design of new nanomaterials and biochemical molecules. The first experimental step in developing quantum devices has been to bring single quanta under complete control. This has mostly been accomplished over the last two decades. Laboratories around the world now routinely trap, isolate and probe individual atoms, ions, electrons, spins and photons. These systems form 'qubits', the elementary building blocks of quantum computers. The next step is to put these qubits together to form quantum circuits, simulators, networks and eventually computers. However, as the number of qubits in a device grows, so too does the complexity of describing and controlling the properties of that device. This complexity underlies the potential power of quantum technology but also brings many theoretical and experimental challenges. This project seeks to address two of these challenges. <br/><br/>First, what physical mechanisms can stabilize the multi-qubit systems so as to make them usable quantum devices? One possibility is provided by a recently discovered phenomenon called 'many-body localization'. Usually, the unavoidable presence of disorder in experiments leads to difficulties controlling the qubits. Counter-intuitively, it seems that putting in more disorder can actually help by 'localizing' the quantum information, preventing it from escaping into the environment as noise. Many of the fundamental features of localization remain unknown. By a combination of classical computational and analytical studies, the group aims to elucidate the conditions under which the many-body localized phase arises, the near-term experimental consequences and its potential as an intrinsic platform for quantum computing. <br/><br/>Second, what kinds of problems can we expect a quantum computer to be able to solve? There are efficient quantum algorithms for particular problems, such as simulating molecular structure and breaking cryptographic codes. However, the most general optimization problems are believed to be hard even for a quantum computer. What distinguishes these hard problems from the tractable ones is an outstanding open question whose answer has profound consequences. The aim is to develop a better understanding of typical quantum optimization problems through a case study of a canonical example: quantum satisfiability. It is expected that insights into this problem will lead to new heuristic quantum algorithms. A similar line of inquiry in classical computation led to important classical optimization algorithms, such as simulated annealing and belief propagation.<br/><br/>From a somewhat more technical point of view, these two projects are related by their reliance on the techniques of disordered statistical mechanics and spin glass theory. Their study will rely on both numerical simulations using large scale classical computer clusters and analytic study using the cavity method and its quantum generalizations. This latter method was developed previously for the study of quantum spin glasses. The projects will help train one to two graduate students in the relevant physics and techniques."
0.1,"The nascent field of quantum information promises amazing and important capabilities, such as ultra-secure encryption, ultra-fast computation, and ultra-precise metrology. Photons are excellent carriers of quantum information, having been employed in numerous groundbreaking quantum information processing experiments. However, although many approaches to realizing a reliable periodic source of single photons - a critical resource for quantum applications - are being pursued, to date none operates at a level sufficient for realizing scalable optical quantum information processing. To date, nearly all experiments have been limited by inefficient photon-pair sources and detectors. Consequently, for example, a protocol needing five photons would be the equivalent of rolling five die and getting a ""6"" on each one, with the likelihood of only (1/6)(1/6)(1/6)(1/6)(1/6)= 0.00013. By incorporating time multiplexing of the photon source - making multiple attempts (~20) until we get a successful output, the success probability to create five photons is increased in principle to 88%. Large-scale quantum information processing also requires highly efficient detectors and high-fidelity photonic circuits. This project will solve these needs, combining advanced technologies for periodic single-/multi-photon sources, integrated photonic waveguide circuits, and highly efficient single-photon detectors. The net result will be a new capability for optical quantum information processing, greatly exceeding what has been possible until now.<br/><br/>The realization of an efficient periodic source of indistinguishable photons is an enabling technology for many quantum information protocols, including one-way quantum computing, improved quantum cryptography, and quantum metrology. It would immediately enhance almost all existing quantum communication protocols, simultaneously increasing the possible rate while reducing the deleterious effects of multi-photon events. Spontaneous parametric downconversion is well known as a source of heralded single photons - detecting one of the daughter photons indicates the presence of the other one. However, the downconversion process itself is probabilistic, and therefore the resulting single photons are not on-demand; furthermore, using a brighter pump pulse to increase the likelihood of producing a pair automatically increases the unwanted probability of producing more than one pair. By employing temporal multiplexing, allowing photons created in any one of, e.g., 50 time slots to be mapped onto a single final time window, the net efficiency for single-photon creation can be greatly enhanced, while minimizing the likelihood of unwanted multi-photon events. The benefit becomes even greater when intentionally trying to create states with many photons: the methods developed here could enable rate enhancements over five orders of magnitude (and for one experiment up to 12 orders!). A similar improvement in optical circuitry (with regard to size and stability) is realized using custom-fabricated waveguides written into low-loss glass. One key feature of this work is the collaboration with Israeli researcher Yaron Silberberg, who will develop the required photonic waveguide circuitry, and work with the group on the final set of applications. The technology of 'integrating' a large number of waveguides and optics such as beamsplitters and phase shifters into a tiny glass substrate (approximately cross 5 centimeter area) will provide enhanced stability and interference between multiple photons. Thus, the unique bi-national connection in this proposal enables the development and implementation of sophisticated quantum photonic systems well beyond those that have been possible to date, until now limited to only a few photons. Combining the new source with optimized photonic waveguide circuitry, the project will then investigate several interesting photon-based quantum effects, including potentially scalable optical quantum logic and quantum walks."
0.396071,"A single particle of light, or a photon, can be correlated with another photon such that measuring the properties of one instantaneously affects the properties of the other even if they are not in the same location. Such correlations make photons useful for creating new technologies that allow for faster and more powerful computing and completely secure communication as well as for testing fundamental physical theories. Yet creating photons with just the right correlations for such applications remains challenging. This research project addresses these difficulties by creating and demonstrating new techniques for measuring and controlling single photons and the matter with which they interact. By adjusting the energy source and medium in which photons are created, photons are created whose correlations are close to ideal for new technologies and fundamental tests of physics principles. It has been shown that single photons with properties suitable for secure long-distance communication can be stored in a memory made of a gas of atoms that preserves their correlations. In this project the interaction of light with the environment itself, such as how light is absorbed and transferred between different forms of energy in molecules, will be studied. The correlations of single photons will be used to gain more insight into how such processes occur. Extending the ability to control the properties of single photons and their interactions with matter has implications for creating new types of computing based on the laws of quantum mechanics that can solve otherwise prohibitive mathematical problems and simulate complex physical systems. It also enables methods of sending information completely securely, with clear indications of any eavesdropping, and improves the ability to test the theory of quantum mechanics. Understanding light-matter interaction in molecules supports the creation of new drugs and improvement of technologies that use such molecules. This research project also provides students training in quantum optics and atomic and molecular physics and informs the public about quantum technologies through demonstrations, museum exhibits and public lectures.<br/><br/>This research project extends our understanding and ability to control the spatial and spectral-temporal properties of quantum states and their correlations. Quantum applications that utilize photonic quantum states often have specific requirements for the photons' spatial and spectral-temporal properties and correlations in order to perform protocols. Through this work new techniques will be developed and applied to measure with unprecedented speed and resolution the joint correlations of photonic quantum states produced via spontaneous four-wave mixing. The spectral tunability of photon-pairs created in artificially structured materials will be explored using a new scheme based on dual-pump spontaneous four-wave mixing. Photonic quantum states will be engineered using self- and cross-phase modulation and by tuning the group velocity difference between two distinct pumps, to create photon pairs that are completely uncorrelated (except for the existence of one indicating the other).<br/><br/>Quantum memories, are critical components for quantum information processing applications. High-bandwidth storage and retrieval of telecom-wavelength photons using an off-resonant Raman protocol in atomic barium vapor will be demonstrated. The inherent correlations of the atomic system will be utilized to generate pure photons useful for quantum applications relying on high-visibility two-photon interference and demonstrate entanglement of atomic ensembles. Quantum information research has resulted in techniques to measure the spatial, spectral and temporal correlations of photonic quantum states. These techniques will be extended and applied to better understand and control the materials with which the photons interact. New spectroscopies based on single-photon level interference and coincidence detection will be used to gain unique insight into the coherence and population dynamics of molecular liquids, including the intricate redistribution of energy among vibrational states.<br/><br/>By extending the understanding and ability to control ultrafast photonic quantum states and their interactions with material systems, the research contributes significantly to the goals of quantum information research in the areas of quantum communication, quantum computation, and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. The new techniques demonstrated for quantum control in the spectral, temporal and spatial domains of photonic, atomic and molecular quantum states have the potential to open up exciting new avenues of research and technology development. The research is integrated with outreach components to inform the public and K-12 students about the amazing properties of single photons. The PI prepares interactive demonstrations of the applications of single photons in quantum communication for display in the University of Illinois physics building, and for presentation at public outreach lectures, engineering open houses, and for exhibit in a local children's museum. The research provides professional training to graduate students in quantum optics and atomic and molecular physics."
0.3,"Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform information-processing tasks that cannot be performed efficiently using conventional information-processing systems. This project funds center-wide research and outreach activities of the Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC). The Center involves the efforts of four faculty members at the University of New Mexico (UNM) and one at the University of Arizona (UA). The goal of research at CQuIC is to combine the abstract understanding of QIS that comes from mathematical physics and computer science with the practical knowledge of physical systems that comes from physics, in order to design practical quantum-information-processing protocols and to implement such protocols in laboratories at UNM and UA. <br/><br/>CQuIC's chief scientific-outreach activity is the administration and organization of the SQuInT Network, a consortium of 26 node institutions, including research universities, undergraduate colleges, national and industrial laboratories, and international centers for QIS research. The SQuInT Annual Workshop, which had its seventeenth installment in February 2015, has grown to be one of the major scientific meetings in QIS, unique in its integration of physics and information-science talks and its emphasis on presentations by a mix of senior personnel, postdocs, and students. This project provides partial, but substantial support for the SQuInT Annual Workshop. <br/><br/>The research to be carried out under this project has two different, but closely related focuses. The first is development of fundamental techniques for preparation of quantum states, control of quantum dynamics, and precision measurement, together with verification of any of these three. Some of the proposed research is theoretical and platform independent: Investigate in-situ characterization of errors in quantum information processing (QIP) protocols using syndrome data from quantum error correction. Other research is tightly coupled theory-experiment development and refinement of control toolkits for particular quantum systems, in this case, optical photons and cesium atomic ensembles: Develop and implement sophisticated techniques for state, process, and detector (POVM) tomography in the 16-dimensional ground hyperfine manifold of the cesium atom, and develop and implement techniques to control and squeeze the collective spin of atomic ensembles consisting of a thousand to a million cesium atoms. The second focus is application of these control techniques to QIP tasks. Some of this work is primarily theoretical: Investigate the potential, capabilities, and robustness of analog quantum simulation, with particular attention to the prospects for boson sampling. Other research is tightly coupled theory-experiment application of control techniques to perform QIP tasks in our laboratory systems: Implement the quantum kicked top in the 16-dimensional ground manifold of cesium, and implement sophisticated techniques to discriminate optical-frequency coherent states for enhanced optical communication."
0.180156,"The motions of objects in everyday life appear to follow simple rules (Newton's laws). For example, a hockey puck gliding across ice tends to keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless a force acts on it. It is implicit in Newton's laws that you can always measure everything about the puck's motion, such as its position and its speed, without affecting the motion. It seems that the same should be true of any object, whether it is huge like the planet earth or tiny like an atom. However, this is not how nature works; very small objects, such as an atom or an electron, seem to obey a different set of rules, called quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics predicts that strange things can happen, for example, an atom can have properties of being in two places at the same time, until its position is actually measured. As strange as those rules are, they make the electronics in computers and cell phones work, so we know they are accurate. Why don't hockey pucks have this strange quantum behavior? Interaction with other objects tends to hide the effects of quantum mechanics for objects much larger than atoms. The research team supported by this project will levitate a tiny diamond crystal in a chamber with almost no air remaining to minimize its interaction with other objects and stretch the size limits over which quantum mechanics does apply. The results of these experiments will improve our understanding of quantum mechanics, which is the foundation on which almost all our modern technology is based. <br/><br/>This program ultimately seeks to produce ""cat states"" in a mechanical system, where an object is in a quantum superposition of two different positions. This is a challenge which has puzzled physicists since the famous thought experiments of Schrodinger, 80 years ago. Researchers supported by this program will demonstrate that a trapped diamond nanocrystal containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers is a nearly ideal platform for creating such motional quantum states. In particular, they will work towards demonstrating four critical capabilities of this system. First, the diamond nanocrystal must be trapped in vacuum with an ultra-high quality factor (Q). Second, it must be possible to manipulate and read out the spin state of the NV centers. Third, the NV center spin states must couple to the state of the mechanical motion. Last, the mechanical motion must be cooled to near the ground state to initialize the system to a known configuration. The experiments begin by loading a diamond nanocrystal into the trap. Next, the spin state of NV centers in the trapped nanodiamond will be read optically and manipulated with a microwave drive. Finally, the mechanical motion is coupled to the NV center spins through externally-imposed magnetic field gradients. The combination of the ultra high Q of the mechanical motion and quantum control of the NV centers makes trapped, NV-containing nanodiamonds a unique system for generating motional quantum states. The development of this system could be of great value in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum mechanics and the properties of novel motional quantum states."
0.175,"Quantum information science (QIS) promises means for storing, transmitting, and processing information in ways not achievable using conventional (classical-physics-based) information technology. Success in QIS could revolutionize both technology and science through new computation and communication capabilities. Major breakthroughs are still needed before these can become reality. It is generally recognized that the most powerful quantum computation will take place using material systems (atoms or electrons). In contrast, quantum communication across a network (a ""Quantum Internet"") will take place using light (photons). In addition, specialized quantum-information processing will take place using light or a combination of light and interacting atoms, as needed, for example, to construct signal repeaters for extending the range of quantum communication over longer distances. This project will develop a radical, yet practical, new approach to using photons to encode quantum information.<br/><br/>Photons in a light beam have four distinct properties, any of which could be used to encode quantum-information: polarization (e.g., vertical or horizontal), two-dimensions of beam profile (spatial shape), and temporal shape (variation in time of brightness during a light pulse). In order to fully utilize light for transmitting information in a quantum network, it is necessary to be able to manipulate and sort a beam of light according to the states associated with each of these properties. While polarization and spatial beam profiles have been previously developed as means for encoding quantum information on photons, the temporal shape of photons has gone largely unrecognized as an important potential technique. The project endeavors to complete the ""tool kit"" for photon-based QIS by developing means to use photon temporal shape to encode information. This approach has predicted benefits in that 1) it allows more than one bit of information to be encoded on a single photon, 2) the encoding method is robust against the alterations of light that occur while traveling in a long optical fiber, and 3) the method nicely interfaces with atom-based quantum-light memories, which will be used in the future construction of a Quantum Internet. <br/><br/>Controlling quantum systems is of broad interest in science and information technology, metrology, quantum chemistry, and nano-mechanics. Optical technology and quantum-optics-based information science offer excellent opportunities to integrate research with science education. To improve the quality of general science education for non-science majors, the P.I. cofounded in 2010 the Science Literacy Program (SLP) at the University of Oregon, and serves as its Co-Director. The SLP has provided mentored instructional opportunities to many graduate students and undergraduate science majors serving as co-instructors in science literacy courses. He developed and taught an SLP course, Quantum Physics for Everyone, which presented quantum information science to non-science majors, using active learning techniques to engage the students. He will continue serving as SLP Co-Director.<br/><br/>From a more technical perspective, the project will develop the idea that in QIS, temporal modes (TMs) of photons, and more generally light fields, should be viewed on an equal footing with polarization and transverse modes. TMs are wave-packet modes that have the same carrier frequency, polarization, and transverse spatial mode, and occupy the same time bin, but yet are temporal orthogonal. To enable the development of TMs for use as qubits and qudits, the central needed technology is the quantum pulse gate (QPG), which will implement a near-100% efficient spatial sorting of field-orthogonal TMs. Based on their recently proposed method of temporal-mode interferometry (TMI), the researchers will demonstrate the elements of a complete quantum information framework that employs field orthogonality of single-photon temporal modes. The three requirements - generation of resource states, the targeted and efficient manipulation of TMs, and their detection and characterization - can be fulfilled with current technology. In particular, the researchers will study, experimentally and theoretically, means for implementing single-qubit quantum-logic operations (Pauli-X, -Y, and -Z gates; and phase-shift gate) using the quantum pulse gate device as the basic building block. They will also demonstrate that the QPG can act as a real-time controllable switch that is temporal-mode selective, by varying a phase shift internal to the device. In addition, they will demonstrate means for verifying the fidelity of such gate operations, using a new form of quantum-state tomography, which can determine the quantum state directly in a TM basis."

DarkSide-50 will take advantage of the Borexino Counting Test Facility (CTF) and of the scintillator and water purification equipment built at the underground lab at Gran Sasso, Italy by the Borexino collaboration. While the Borexino and DarkSide collaborations remain two separate entities, almost all of the Borexino groups have joined the DarkSide Collaboration, and will work on both activities.<br/><br/>Borexino is a detector designed to observe low-energy solar neutrinos. It is the most recent large-scale, real-time solar neutrino detector to become operational and has been in operation for a little more than three years, during which time it has acquired solar and terrestrial neutrino data. The solar neutrino goal is to improve the measurement of Beryllium-7 neutrinos to an uncertainty less than 5%, and to make the first real time measurements of other neutrino branches, especially the pep, and possibly also the pp and CNO neutrinos. DarkSide-50 is a 50-kg dual-phase argon detector under development for the direct detection of dark matter particles. It is designed to test innovative low background methods to ensure background-free operation. It will initiate the use of underground argon for dark matter applications. It will be deployed, enclosed in a liquid scintillator neutron veto, within the CTF water tank. The scintillator-water combined shield provides background-free operation for ton-year exposures.<br/><br/>For Broader Impacts, the proposed activity will advance the scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer an excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute to the success of a cutting edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&O programs such as the Princeton-Abruzzo-South Dakota summer school for high school students."

0.32,"Quantum information technologies are a driving force for the advancement of fundamental physics and enable large-scale secure communication, unprecedented processor speeds, and higher resolution measurement techniques. These applications require a source of entangled photons, which act as bits of information with interesting quantum properties, as well as circuits that can manipulate and measure these photons. An almost unexplored approach is to generate triplets of entangled photons in a single step. This scheme significantly simplifies the generation of larger entangled states, enabling exciting quantum experiments and filling a huge gap in the development of quantum computers. In this project, the investigator and his students will use titanium dioxide (TiO2) integrated photonic circuits to produce triplets in a robust, scalable, and commercially viable format. Leveraging their expertise in TiO2, nonlinear optics and integrated photonic devices, the group will develop a source that directly produces entangled triplet photons at telecommunications wavelengths. Maturation of TiO2 and photonic integrated quantum circuits will move the field of quantum information science in the direction of commercializable products. While advancing the discoveries in the fields described above, this project will also contribute to the training of future multidisciplinary scientists and engineers through research-based education of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Quantum information technologies are a driving force for the advancement of fundamental theories and can enable large-scale secure networks, quantum information processors, and enhanced measurement and lithographic techniques. Photonics is an ideal platform for such technologies; however, the generation, manipulation, and detection of single and entangled photons remain a challenge. While sources of spontaneous single and pairs of photons are widespread, triplet-photon sources are almost completely unexplored and represent the missing link for fundamental tests in quantum theory and heralded photon pairs for quantum communication and computation. Furthermore, a triplet-photon source significantly simplifies the generation of larger entangled states. This project will seek to developm a source that can directly produce entangled triplet photons at telecommunications wavelengths (e.g., 1500 nm) at a rate of 4,000 triplets/sec (six orders of magnitude greater than current experimental efforts) using third-order spontaneous parametric down-conversion. By coupling to a resonant cavity, the group will further enhance the emission rate by an additional order of magnitude and improve spectral control. TiO2 is the ideal material for this process because of its high transparency, large nonlinearity, high linear refractive indices, and negligible fluorescence. The group will exploit the strong, sustained nonlinearity and tight light-confinement in TiO2 devices to achieve unprecedented triplet-photon generation rates directly on chip, where they can readily be routed, manipulated, and then measured using integrated detectors."

0.15,"The recent developments in information technology are having a large impact on the society. One factor in the explosion of new technologies is the rapid increase in computing power, described by Moore's law: processor power doubles every 18 months. This is accompanied by a reduction in the size of the processors. In the near future, the actual processors based on classical treatment of information will reach the quantum limit; the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics will come into play. Quantum Information Science (QIS) is a new approach to information science that takes advantage of laws of quantum mechanics. New advances in quantum information indicate that devices based on fundamental quantum principles, such as interference and entanglement, can perform certain tasks considerably more efficiently than any classical computer. Efforts in quantum information processing have led to protocols for quantum cryptography, and quantum algorithms. Many platforms have been studied for QIS, such as trapped ions, neutral atoms, Rydberg atoms, atoms in crystals, spin of particles, photons in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) or nonlinear optical setups, mesoscopic ensembles, and polar molecules.<br/><br/>As the field of quantum information science matures, so do its goals. There is a search for more realistic and better scalable systems, for novel areas of application and stronger cross-fertilization with other areas in physics. A hybrid platform for generating quantum states and for quantum information processing, based on molecular ions will be studied, with an eye towards feasibility, scalability, and connection with other subfields in physics. This hybrid platform shares the advantages of other platforms; the long coherence times of neutral atoms, and strong interactions of trapped ions. The required properties of these systems will be studied in order to identify the best candidates among molecular ions that will allow the Coulomb interactions between atoms to be switched off and on. This will help guide efforts in designing new experimental apparatus for quantum information processing.<br/><br/>The main effort relates to quantum information science, namely the possible generation of quantum states, and the implementation of phase gates. First, the use of molecular ions as enablers to design non-trivial states, such as non-local atoms will be explored. Specific species, alkali+alkaline earth and homonuclear alkaline earth diatomic molecular ions will be studied and their properties (energy surfaces, transition moments, hyperfine structure, etc.) computed. Second, arrays of neutral atoms and trapped ions that could be used to effectively create strong long-range interactions that can be switched on and off by using molecular ions as mediators to enable entanglement will be studied, systems, such as combinations of sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca), Na + Ca+, or Ca + Ca+. These new systems will be explored using realistic parameters from careful calculations, to help in understanding complex physical systems, and to predict new phenomena and to generate new theoretical concepts.

The main challenge for building a quantum computer is that quantum components are prone to error. Error correction can be used to overcome this challenge but it places stringent requirements on future quantum computer hardware. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path for bridging the gap between current physical hardware and large-scale quantum algorithms. Specifically how a state-of-the-art quantum error correction scheme, the surface code, behaves when mapped to realistic physical architectures will be examined. If successful, this research will help experimentalists build the first universal scalable quantum computer.

0.15,"Quantum computers have the potential to solve problems that are completely impossible for classical computers, ranging from cryptography for national defense to face recognition and drug development. Just as the transistor is the building block of all modern digital circuits, the quantum bit (aka the qubit) is the heart of a quantum computer. Superconducting qubits, which are essentially artificial two-level atoms that can be designed and fabricated using integrated circuit technology, have emerged as one of the top candidates for realizing scalable quantum information processing. In order to perform quantum computation successfully, quantum computing circuits must be able to transfer quantum information rapidly among a large number of qubits with high fidelity. However, because existing protocols for quantum information transfer (QIT) are in general an order of magnitude slower than single qubit gates, QIT has become the bottleneck for quantum computation. Furthermore, conventional methods of QIT either require a large amount of on-chip real estate or have relatively low quality factor leading to lower efficiency and fidelity. Therefore, it is difficult to scale up qubit circuits to a practically useful size with these protocols. The focus of this project is to demonstrate the basic elements of a novel method of quantum information transmission in superconducting qubit circuits. This new approach uses ""dual-rail arrays of negative-inductance Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (nSQUIDs)"" as the information transmitting structures for significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art QIT protocols. The negative mutual inductance between the branches of an nSQUID assigns the two tasks of processing and transferring quantum information to different parts of the nSQUID circuit and therefore makes it possible to optimize parameters of each part for its particular task, so that much faster QIT can be achieved. The success of the project will thus remove one of the most critical roadblocks to building quantum computers. Therefore, knowledge and insights gained from the project activities can be readily applied to other superconducting qubit based quantum computing circuits.<br/><br/>Quantum information research has emerged as a highly competitive cutting edge research field which is actively pursued by all major nations around the world. It is critically important to national security and to maintaining United States' leadership position in scientific discoveries and technological innovations. This collaborative project between theoretical and experimental groups in quantum circuit physics provides a good opportunity for education and training of the graduate and undergraduate students in one of the frontiers of scientific exploration. The project also includes significant outreach and education activities such as improving the undergraduate and graduate classes in Quantum Computing developed with previous NSF support at the University of Kansas and Stony Brook University; involving undergraduates into quantum information research at Kansas; and presenting colloquia on quantum information at local high schools, colleges and universities."

For this an ion crystal will be cooled close to the absolute zero point of temperature and placed in a periodic potential formed by two interfering light beams. In this way the hypothesis that the onset of friction is connected to a quantum phase transition will be tested.<br/><br/>These research efforts will be complemented by modernizing physics education with a quantum information inspired syllabus.

0.54,"Quantum computing promises exponential speedups over classical computing for specific but important tasks, such as data encryption and the simulation of quantum physics. However, the practical implementation of quantum computing faces daunting challenges: the need for scalability of ""Qbit"" (here, ""Qmode"") registers and the need to circumvent decoherence. This project from Prof. Pfister at the University of Virginia (UVa) aims at implementing large-scale entanglement in the periodic emission spectrum of an optical parametric oscillator (OPO), a.k.a. the ""quantum optical frequency comb"" (QOFC). It is based on the recent realization by Pfister's group of high-quality entanglement in a world-record 60 eigenmodes (""Qmodes"") of the QOFC of a single OPO, into 15 sets of 4 Qmodes, each set being in a square cluster state. This successful experiment was the core of the project supported by an NSF award entitled ""One-way quantum computing in the optical frequency comb."" The objective of the current project is to build on this success and forge ahead toward highly scalable quantum information, along two lines of effort. On the one hand, we seek to generate record-size linear, square-grid, and cubic-lattice cluster states, which enable universal quantum computation. On the other hand, the group is striving to implement the quantum technologies needed for quantum processing in the QOFC. This includes: (i) developing low-loss, highly dispersive optical elements to separate Qmodes, (ii) implementing a network of balanced homodyne detection with high-efficiency PIN photodiodes using integrated optics, and (iii) performing high-efficiency nonGaussian measurements by way of photon-number-resolved detection, which has recently been implemented in Pfister's group at UVa thanks to a collaboration with Sae Woo Nam at NIST and Aaron Miller at Albion College, funded by an NSF MRI award entitled ""Development of a photon-number-resolving detector system for universal quantum computing."" This ambitious program is tantamount to creating a bona fide quantum computer over continuous variables, and studying quantum information in this context.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work comprise an active research contribution to the UVa physics graduate and undergraduate programs. One recent undergraduate student was a former Goldwater Scholar who just joined the physics graduate program at Harvard, was a finalist of the 2011 LeRoy Apker Award of the American Physical Society, based on a paper he published with Prof. Pfister. Also stemming from this research, an advanced graduate course ""Quantum Optics and Quantum Information"" is now taught by the PI on a regular basis. On the interdisciplinary front, this research has spawned worldwide collaborative efforts. Finally, it is important to point out that quantum computing research has stakes in fundamental physics, as well as Defense and National Security: Shor's algorithm for factoring integers exponentially faster would defeat the widely-used RSA encryption protocol. Another direct application of a universal quantum processor of elementary size would be the modeling of presently intractable quantum problems in chemistry, materials science, and condensed-matter physics. Finally, the realization of a scalable quantum register offers possibilities for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics in the regime of mesoscopic entanglement and Schrödinger cats, where theoretical predictions become intractable. As quantum information comes of age, one can thus expect deeply significant scientific discoveries in all fields of the natural sciences."
0.258146,"Quantum memory that faithfully stores and retrieve quantum states is a basic building block for quantum repeaters in long-distance quantum communication. Among the existing approaches to implementing quantum memories, the atomic frequency comb (AFC) in rare-earth ensemble is identified for its outstanding potential, which includes memory efficiency up to 100%, high fidelity, long storage times up to seconds, a large time-bandwidth product for a high bit rate up to gigabit/s, multi-mode capacity, a large range of operational wavelengths, and being solid-state with a relatively simple setup using off-the-shelf components. Achieving high efficiency is the corner stone to fully realize theis potential. Currently, the two major obstacles preventing optimal efficiency are the low absorption length and poorly-formed spectral and spatial structures in the AFC. In this NSF supported project, two novel schemes are combined to solve the problems: employing a low finesse optical cavity to boost the absorption length, and using various temporal, spectral and spatial configurations to optimize the AFC structure. The main efforts will focus on understanding the physics and developing critical enabling techniques in preparing the AFC in rare-earth ensembles and in the storage/retrieving process. We plan to use thulium ions doped crystals as prototype materials to develop and test the schemes. The resulting methods and techniques are expected to be applicable to similar rare-earth ensembles.<br/><br/>The supported project will have broad impact in advancing quantum information science and technology. The project aims at great advances in quantum memories towards practical devices, which will find applications in both long-distance quantum communication and distributed quantum computation.

The efforts focus on cultivating a new generation of scientists and engineers in quantum information-related fields and contributing to the diversity of the scientific workforce. An on-line quantum mechanics course will be developed for high school science teachers so that our K-12 school system will be better prepared to introduce quantum concepts to students at young age.

Qubits and qudits (d-level quantum systems) encoded in atomic ground hyperfine states are especially useful for such work because they provide long coherence times, can be coherently manipulated with radiofrequency and microwave fields, and can be probed weakly or strongly with optical fields. Efforts will be focused on two closely related areas of research. The first concerns control and measurement of quantum systems with complex internal structure, and has as its primary objectives to implement unitary control of qubits and qudits encoded in the 16-dimensional hyperfine ground manifold, to explore methods to prepare arbitrary mixed states and implement completely positive maps, and to improve or develop new protocols for quantum state and process tomography based on weak measurement and augmented by new ideas such as compressed sensing. The second focus area relates to quantum control on real world platforms, and has as its primary goals to improve and extend tools for robust qudit control in inhomogeneously broadened quantum systems, and to apply these to atoms in optical dipole traps and optical nanofiber surface traps.

QIS is now pursued in many contexts, including nanofabricated condensed matter systems, cold atoms and ions, linear and nonlinear optical systems, and various hybrids thereof. Though details vary with the physics at hand, one of the most fundamental challenges of QIS is universal: one must prepare the relevant quantum system in a well defined initial state, drive it though a complex evolution, and access the final state through measurement. In doing so, many of the tools developed on one platform can be applied to another. This project will use cold atoms as a testbed for control of quantum systems that have more than two levels. The resulting toolbox is likely to be useful and perhaps essential in the many implementations where carriers of quantum information have complex internal structure. The project will also contribute to the training of future scientists in the highly interdisciplinary field of QIS. Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results. The project is a cornerstone of the NSF supported Center for Quantum Information and Control, co-located at the University of Arizona College of Optical Science and the University of New Mexico Department of Physics and Astronomy. Weekly video conferencing, an annual research retreat, and joint participation in conferences will enrich the educational experience and strengthen the connections between junior and senior participants at both institutions."
0.14,"Information technology has been an engine for economic growth largely due to the trend known as Moore's law, whereby the component density and computational power of computer chips doubles approximately every two years. In the not too distant future the building blocks of these circuits is set to reach atomic scale, where the laws of quantum physics will replace the familiar laws of classical physics that govern our everyday world. Surprisingly, theoretical studies have shown that if we can manipulate and control quantum devices as well as we now manipulate and control classical devices, entirely new avenues will open up to process information according to quantum mechanics. As a result, quantum computers will in principle be able to solve some important computational problems exponentially faster than classical computers. It is also thought that a simpler class of devices, commonly referred to as analog quantum simulators, may provide approximate solutions to important problems in chemistry and materials science that are currently intractable. Though a functional quantum computer remains a distant goal, the transformative ideas of quantum computation and simulation hold promise to radically expand the capabilities of computer and information technology and sustain its future growth.<br/><br/>This award builds on previous accomplishments by the Principal Investigators in the science and engineering field known as quantum control, which studies how physical devices governed by quantum mechanics can be manipulated and controlled with high precision, even in the presence of inevitable device imperfections and outside disturbances. The first objective of this award is to develop new techniques whereby one can evaluate and verify the operation of quantum devices. This will be done through the use of protocols known as quantum tomography, which determine the state and behavior of a quantum device through a series of carefully chosen measurements. The challenge will be to make these protocols more efficient, i. e., minimizing the number of measurements required, and also more robust, e. g., reliable in the presence of imperfections. The second objective of this award is to realize an analog quantum simulator based on a single atom. This single-atom device will be used to simulate a model system whose behavior is known to be chaotic, i. e., hypersensitive to imperfections and outside disturbances. By quantifying the accuracy of the simulator in the presence of known imperfections, this research will address essential but so far unanswered questions: How far can one trust the predictions of an analog quantum simulator in this challenging but common scenario? And can its accuracy and reliability be improved through state-of-the-art techniques for quantum control? The answer to these questions is relevant for large, federally funded research programs in analog quantum simulation at top research institutions across the US.<br/><br/>State-of-the-art quantum control is approaching the thresholds for fault-tolerant operation on a few physical platforms and is steadily improving on many others. As a result, researchers are now pursuing architectures for rudimentary digital quantum computation and analog quantum simulation (AQS). To continue on this path towards useful quantum information processing (QIP), there is an urgent need for more sophisticated tools in the areas of quantum control and quantum tomography, and especially for protocols that are resistant to real-world errors and imperfections. Furthermore, the quantum information community is heavily invested in AQS under the assumption that errors are less critical than in a digital quantum computer. This makes it imperative to study the tolerance of AQS to errors, even in the absence of decoherence, and the prospects of robust control in the context of complex dynamics such as quantum chaos.<br/><br/>This award will focus on quantum control and measurement, and their application in quantum tomography and analog quantum simulation. The work will build on well established ideas from optimal control and measurement theory, bringing these to bear on a unique experimental testbed: electron-nuclear spins of cold 133Cs atoms in their electronic ground state. This system provides long coherence times, can be manipulated with radio-frequency, microwave, and optical fields, is accessible to measurement though Stern-Gerlach analysis, and has a 16-dimensional Hilbert space, large enough to explore non-trivial tasks of QIP. With its proven capability to apply high-fidelity unitary maps and perform high-fidelity orthogonal measurements, the testbed provides the building blocks needed for QIP at levels of increasing complexity. The planned research is a mixture of theory and experiment, and will address topics in quantum measurement and tomography. In addition, analog quantum simulation, studying the quantum simulation of a spin-15/2 Quantum Kicked Top (QKT) and the use of the QKT paradigm to explore robust quantum simulation in the presence of chaos will be explored. Because the methodologies of robust control and tomography are independent of any particular platform, results from this award will serve as a benchmark for what can be achieved, and a template for similar advances elsewhere in laboratories working with different physical systems. This will help facilitate progress in the broader field of QIP."
0.352924,"Underlying the global economy is the ability to process information quickly and cheaply. The field of quantum information processing, which harnesses the unusual features of quantum physics, offers a novel approach to rapid encoding and manipulation of information. In this project, researchers from Middlebury College, Harvard, and University of Copenhagen create and investigate quantum bits (qubits) ""the fundamental building blocks of quantum computation"" formed from carbon nanotubes. The team of researchers exploits the unique properties of carbon nanotubes to manipulate and interrogate the qubits, with the goal of demonstrating coherent control of the fragile quantum states. The key properties of nanotubes that make them well suited for quantum information processing are themselves newly understood, and are a forefront area of fundamental physics. Those properties include spin-orbit coupling associated with circumferential motion around the nanotube, electron-nuclear coupling and the ability to control dephasing of electron spin. The project is a good balance between future potential applications in the exciting area of quantum information, and condensed matter physics in nanoscale electronics, as fundamental physics. Students involved in the project particularly appreciate the connection between fundamental and applied components of the activity.<br/><br/>The subject of the project ""quantum information processing"" is inherently revolutionary. In addition, the project is designed to build on the exceptional strengths of liberal arts colleges and research universities in educating students and conducting research. Undergraduates perform a significant portion of the research, providing invaluable training for careers in physics. Research conducted at Harvard during the summer feeds directly into the curriculum at the PI's institution, Middlebury College, as students work in parallel on credit-bearing projects and senior theses and interact with their peers at Harvard. The aim is to foster a critical mass of students who are deeply engaged in all aspects of research, from collecting and analyzing data to presenting results, and who have the training and expertise necessary to excel in physics."
0.2,"From intelligence briefings to ecommerce, nearly all levels of society rely on the secure transmission of private information. When two or more parties share secret data, often there are certain actions they can perform to strengthen their information security. For example, sometimes revealing partial information to an unwanted eavesdropper can actually improve the overall security. This project seeks to develop a quantitative picture of how secrecy evolves as the trusted parties manipulate their data and publicly share part of their information with one another. A novel approach to this problem will be adopted through the use of recently developed techniques in the study of quantum entanglement and the theory of entanglement transformations. The notion of secrecy will be placed on the same fundamental level as quantum entanglement in that both will be viewed as precious physical resources that can be manipulated and used for various information processing tasks. Investigating the connection between classical secrecy and quantum entanglement will not only offer a new level of unification between quantum mechanics and classical information theory, but it will also yield a fresh perspective on how quantum and classical physics differ. Ultimately, the deeper understanding of classical secrecy developed in this project will lead to improved security analysis and new methodologies for securely transmitting information.<br/><br/>This research program investigates fundamental questions in quantum information theory and classical cryptography. A typical quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol (like those employed by commercial QKD machines) consists of two separate phases - called Alice and Bob - who use a quantum channel to exchange quantum information between them. However, in this process an eavesdropper - named Eve - may interact with their state so that all three systems are described by the joint quantum state &#961;ABE. Eventually the parties measure their respective systems and obtain measurement outcomes, i.e. classical data. But due to the indeterminism of quantum mechanics, this measurement data can only be described by some tripartite probability distribution PABE. The second phase of the QKD protocol is purely classical and now consists of Alice and Bob using local operations and public communication to convert the distribution PABE into secret key states, which are perfectly correlated bits shared between Alice and Bob, yet completely hidden from Eve. This process is known as public key agreement, or secret key distillation. Using secret key states, Alice and Bob will be able to transmit data secretly from Eve, regardless of her computational power. The distribution PABE is said to possess ""secret correlations"" since using public key agreement, it can be converted into secret key states. <br/><br/>Classical systems that share secret correlations behave remarkably similar to quantum systems that share entanglement. In particular, both quantum entanglement and secret correlations are capable of being transformed, degraded, and enhanced through local physical processing and global classical communication. In this project, a mathematical framework will be constructed that is suitable for studying the most general physical manipulations of secret correlations, something currently lacking in the research literature. Within this framework, new analytic tools will be developed to study the crucial problem of secret key distillation and the broader question of when one type of secret correlations can be transformed into another. A particular focus will be on generating new secrecy monotones and measures that do not rely exclusively on information-theoretic quantities such as entropy and mutual information. Additionally, novel cryptographic paradigms will be introduced that are inspired by similar primitives in quantum information theory, such as random entanglement distillation and entanglement combing. An underlying goal of this project will be to unify classical secrecy and quantum entanglement as physical analogs. Under such a correspondence, known techniques and results in entanglement theory can be applied in the study of secrecy, and vice versa."
0.38115,"Harnessing the quantum behavior of nanoscopic physical systems is at the center of a broad cross-disciplinary effort driven by the promise of various applications for information processing and secure communication. The prospect of performance gains and increased complexity is driving interest in new devices for existing or new functions (particularly, quantum information processing (QIP) protocols) as well as new paradigms for system architectures beyond present technology. Implementations based on solid-state ""spin complexes"" formed by individual paramagnetic dopants and neighboring nuclear and electronic spins are of particular importance because spin-based quantum technology is well positioned to overcome the obstacles to scaling. Assembling atomically identical spin clusters, however, is unlikely in the near term future, making new protocols necessary to precisely determine the spatial structure of an individual node and selectively address single spins within the complex. In line with these ideas, this grant articulates state-of-the-art nanoscale technology and novel spin manipulation schemes to resolve the network of relative couplings of nuclear spins in the vicinity of the so-called NV center in diamond, arguably one of the most promising platforms for future spintronic and QIP devices. Underlying our effort is the notion of circuits configured to exploit the atomic scale differences between logic units so as to process quantum information in optimal ways. Capitalizing on multi-dimensional spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging schemes, it will be possible to expose the structure and connectivity within the nuclear spin network of a given node in ways resembling the solving of a complex molecular structure. Such information will be crucial to identifying and exploiting long-lived nuclear memories, or to implementing quantum correction protocols without resorting to additional, ad-hoc coupling interfaces. <br/><br/>Besides the technological and scientific advantages, our work is expected to have a broad educational outcome because it will offer students a unique inter-disciplinary scientific training and the ability to interact with a network of collaborating labs. These partnerships not only will provide a broad dissemination platform but also will allow the PI to advance ongoing outreach programs designed to provide meaningful research experiences to underprivileged students through summer activities. These plans gain special meaning at City College, a minority serving institution with a uniquely diverse population of inner-city students. Capitalizing on the various recruitment channels at hand, the teaching, mentoring and career counseling components of this project will truly broaden participation, while encouraging groups underrepresented in the sciences to pursue scientific careers both in academia and in industry."

This intersection of QIS and measurement science is now called quantum metrology. The specific questions to be investigated include how best to deploy physical systems, such as atoms and photons and tiny engineered resonators, to make the best possible measurements of such physical quantities as electric and magnetic fields and gravitational fields and how to use the strange property of quantum entanglement associated with interacting systems to improve such measurements.<br/><br/>PhD students associated with this project will work within the framework of the Center for Quantum Information and Control at the University of New Mexico, which has a proven track record of training PhD students for careers in QIS. CQuIC students take a sequence of elective courses on QIS topics, are exposed to the interdisciplinary ideas of QIS through a high-level, weekly seminar series and through the weekly CQuIC group meeting, at which papers posted to the e-print server arXiv.org are reviewed and discussed and at which students and postdocs receive intensive training in the art of giving technical talks.

0.27,"By combining single-photon technology with semiconductor electro-optical devices we investigate a scheme for a quantum CNOT gate. Such a gate is a fundamental building block of quantum computers and quantum communication systems. Nanofabrication and material-growth concepts will be implemented to create optical micro cavity structures with embedded artificial atoms in the form of a nanoscale semiconductor structure, called a quantum dots. A quantum dot, if positioned at the center of the cavity and at the cavity resonant frequency, will interact with an incoming photon in such a way that the photon polarization will become entangled with the electronic state of the quantum dot. This interaction establishes the quantum CNOT gate; the quantum state of the photon is changed depending on the quantum state of the electron.<br/><br/>The research topic directly relates to the micro optoelectronics industry as well as to fundamental studies of confined electron properties in semiconductors. Potential applications in classical and quantum information storage and processing are expected to follow from this project. Since the interactions are at the single photon level, the devices will in principle be very energy efficient. It should however be mentioned that this study does require low-temperature operation conditions. Alternative implementations based on different cavity designs and different optical emitters that remain active a room temperature will also be considered."
0.530616,"The intellectual merit of this project is to exploit how to take advantage of the rich internal structure of ultra-cold diatomic polar molecules, towards the design of a highly tunable quantum simulator/computer. Polar molecules possess a permanent dipole moment,which can be manipulated with external fields, and which can lead to long-range anisotropic interactions. Two dimensional and one dimensional arrays of polar molecules trapped in optical lattices will be considered. The main idea is to use rotational dressed states of the molecules, which can be easily manipulated and controlled by external dc electric fields and by continuous microwave fields, as the spin (qubit) degrees of freedom of the quantum simulator/computer. Direct dipolar interactions, which are orders of magnitude stronger than those achievable using neutral atoms, will be used to coupled the spins. The goal is to investigate how to use this system to engineer topological states of matter, to simulate models used to describe magnetism in real materials, as well as others that may have no solid state analogs, and to process quantum information.<br/><br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work arise,in part, from the educational and outreach aspects, including the training of graduate students and postdocs. These students will benefit from interacting also with experimental groups at JILA that are world-leaders in the planned research areas. Beyond this, the investigators will continue to contribute to community outreach programs, such as public lectures and accessible physics articles. They will also maintain a significant level of service to the physics community through organizing workshops, serving on review panels, and memberships on professional committees. This project contains interdisciplinary science involving application of the unique atomic structure of bi-alkali polar molecules towards the design of highly-controllable quantum simulators. These simulators are capable, on the one hand, of processing quantum information (QI science), and on the other hand, of generating fundamental insights into the physics of solid state systems, such as cuprate superconductors, transition metal oxides and geometrically frustrated magnetic insulators (material sciences)."

0.15,"The development of quantum mechanical approaches to processing, storage, and transmission of information is being actively pursued around the world. Quantum processors are distinct from existing classical systems in that they harness unique features of quantum physics to enable beyond classical capabilities. These include the potential for efficiently solving currently intractable computational problems, for simulating complex physical systems in order to develop new materials, and the ability to transmit information securely between distant locations. <br/><br/>One of the approaches being actively pursued is to use quantum bits (qubits) stored in neutral atoms for memory and processing and to use optical photons (particles of light) for long distance transmission of information. A necessary step is entanglement, that is where a single particle of light, a photon, and/or an atom can be correlated with another photon or another atom such that measuring the properties of one instantaneously affects the properties of the other even if they are not in the same location. While entanglement between atoms and photons has been demonstrated in many experiments what has not yet been achieved is the ability to combine atom-photon entanglement with atomic qubits that can process and store information. The major goal of this research is to demonstrate atom-photon entanglement and atom based quantum logic gates in a single system that can form the basis for future quantum networks. <br/><br/>The research program will also contribute to the training of students for careers in science and engineering. People from diverse backgrounds will be educated and trained in modern experimental science, and will be equipped to bridge the boundary between physics and information science. Training will occur via curriculum enrichments, and through direct participation in the University based research program. We will also inform the local Madison community about the importance of physics to information technology, and the new developments in the area of quantum information science. Outreach to the public will be facilitated by public visiting days at the Physics department, laboratory tours, faculty visits to local schools, and mentoring of high school students.<br/><br/>Our technical approach is based on the use of small clouds of atoms with from 10-100 Rubidium atoms for the dual purpose of creating entanglement between atoms and photons, and as qubits in a small quantum processor. We will use long range interactions mediated by highly excited Rydberg states of atoms to create deterministic entanglement between qubits encoded in multi-atom ensembles and between ensembles and light. These capabilities will form the basis for efficient quantum repeater architectures needed for long distance distribution of entanglement and quantum networking."
0.245,"Modern fabrication techniques have paved the way for many recent breakthroughs in electrically controlled semiconductor nanostructures with length scales on the order of tens of nanometers. Quantum dot devices containing one or several electrons have even been employed as quantum bits. Although these devices are highly adaptable, only a small number of quantum properties have been exploited to date as the basis for a quantum computer. However, the number of potential quantum variables grows quickly with the number of electrons. The aim of this project is to theoretically explore new multi-electron quantum dot configurations that may be particularly well suited for quantum computing. Experimental designs will be considered that contain multiple electrons per quantum dot, or multiple coupled dots. The goal is to identify quantum bits with desirable properties, in terms of control, speed or versatility. The operation of the new quantum bits will be characterized, and their interactions with the environment will be assessed, in order to optimize quantum operations. The identification of new high performance quantum bits will provide a blueprint for near-term experimental explorations, and for long-term, large-scale implementations.<br/><br/>The broader impacts will involve both researchers and members of the local community. The researchers will benefit from collaborations between scientists with different types of expertise. Graduate students will obtain a valuable range of interdisciplinary training and exposure to cutting edge research in a variety of fields. They will also obtain valuable experience presenting and explaining their research to coworkers with varying backgrounds.

0.201765,"In analogy to the fundamental role that random numbers play in classical information theory, random quantum states and unitary operators are a key resource in quantum information science. Unfortunately, generating a random unitary transformation is intractably inefficient, motivating the investigation of a weaker notion of quantum pseudorandomness that may be achieved efficiently while remaining practically useful. In this program, fundamental properties and implications of quantum pseudorandomness will be explored from a mathematical, information-theoretic, and physical standpoint, by focusing on the generation of pseudorandomness using so-called random quantum circuits. Primary emphasis will be placed on (i) characterizing the behavior of random circuits under more general conditions than considered thus far; and (ii) performing a dedicated study of the effect of implementation errors and decoherence. In doing so, the bigger goal of understanding whether random quantum circuits may serve to model the dynamics of generic many-body quantum systems will be kept in mind, with anticipated connections to the field of quantum chaos.<br/><br/>The scientific impact of this program will be twofold. First, a substantially improved understanding of the complexity involved in generating pseudorandom states and operators using random quantum circuits is expected to emerge. Beside providing a firm theoretical foundation for quantum information protocols that presume randomness as a resource, this could eventually find application in enhanced quantum algorithm design. Second, additional fundamental insights will also be gained on the emergence and characterization of apparent randomness in the properties of complex quantum systems. Intensive training on subjects at the cross-disciplinary boundary between quantum information theory, applied mathematics, and many-body physics will be provided to the graduate student supported by this grant."

This proposal encompasses the activities needed to create the conditions for those individuals to carry out their research.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Discoveries made at the LHC could have revolutionary effects on our<br/>understanding of the unification of forces, the origin and stability of matter, the ultimate underpinnings of the observable universe, and the nature of space-time itself. The LHC, which began operation at ?ãs = 7 TeV in 2010, is expected to reach its design energy (14 TeV) and luminosity (10**34 cm&#8722;2s&#8722;1) during the period covered by this proposal. Early physics papers from CMS have demonstrated the excellent performance of the detector and the analysis chain. The collaboration is poised to explore the standard model Higgs mechanism during the next few years and will probe a wide range of possible phenomena that lie beyond the standard model. U.S. physicists, who constitute approximately 30% of the CMS collaboration, have led many of the early analyses and have made important contributions to virtually all of them. U.S. groups are well positioned to continue this leadership into the discovery phase of LHC operations. It is thus essential to ensure that the detectors developed, constructed, and brought into operation by U.S. groups continue to function at the highest levels of performance; and that data acquired by CMS is made available for analysis by U.S. physicists. There are four main funding categories covered by this proposal: Detector Maintenance<br/>and Operations (M&O) and Software and Computing (S&C), Detector Upgrade R&D, and Common Operations, which includes education and outreach (E&O). The uses of the combined resources of the NSF and the DOE on CMS are managed by the U.S. CMS Operations program and are monitored by the Joint Oversight Group (JOG) composed of representatives of the two agencies.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: LHC research includes advances in technology in several areas, support for university scientific infrastructure, and the opportunity to attract students and the general public to exciting frontier science. Numerous outreach and education possibilities exist, many of which are already being implemented in programs such as QuarkNet. The extensive computing facilities and the interconnecting networks that were established in the past few years will be maintained and expanded. The CMS detector contains a variety of subsystems with numerous technological challenges in areas such as radiation hardness of materials and circuits, precision measurement of ionizing radiation, precision alignment, high-density inter-connecting of electrical signals, and many aspects of computing and data transfer. CMS institutions, often working with industry, have made or implemented innovations in these areas, and R&D continues as part of this proposal. The engineers, technicians, and computer professionals supported in conjunction with the proposed work will maintain and/or add much-needed infrastructure at their respective institutions, facilitating future educational and research opportunities while maintaining a reservoir of the hard-won knowledge gained thus far in building the CMS detector."

This is enabling U.S. physicists to contribute significantly to physics analysis and associated publications. The U.S. ATLAS Operations Program aims to provide the necessary technical support for (1) the maintenance and operation of the U.S.-built detector subsystems;(2) the maintenance and ongoing development of software and computing, and (3), an R&D program for detector upgrades to accommodate accelerator performance improvements . Another component of the program is to provide a strong education and outreach effort. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The goal of the U.S. ATLAS Operations Program is to empower U.S. physicists to address some of the most profound questions in particle physics today: what is the physical origin of mass? Do supersymmetric particles exist and are they associated with dark matter? Does space-time have extra spatial dimensions? Answers to these questions would provide a major advance toward completing a unified view of the particles in nature, the forces with which particles interact, and their role in the past and future of our universe. This is a time when particle physics researchers have compelling indications that the LHC, with collision energies far beyond those available at existing facilities, will lead to especially important discoveries with implications over a broad field of fundamental science. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This proposal will enhance the computing infrastructure for research, education and beyond. The LHC computing requirements are driving a paradigm shift towards global computing with potentially significant economic impacts, and our students will be at the forefront in using these new technologies. NSF-ATLAS groups continue to expand their education and outreach programs, with a particular focus on high school teachers and students and on outreach to under-represented populations. We plan on expanding our outreach efforts during ATLAS data taking, including the network of worldwide grid facilities. The LHC is the major accelerator-based program in which the next generation of physicists is being trained. Support for R&D activities will lay the groundwork for new technologies that might be adopted by other fields as well as train our graduate and undergraduate students.

0.21,"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award supports a fundamental theoretical investigation of the transport properties of ultracold neutral plasmas. Ultracold plasmas are a novel state of matter because the low temperature causes constituent particles, electrons and ions, to be strongly coupled. This medium has fundamentally different properties than traditional plasmas, analogous to the ways in which liquids differ from gases. Strongly coupled plasmas arise in several disciplines influencing energy, security and fundamental physics research. Examples include dense plasmas found in inertial confinement fusion experiments, intense laser-material interaction studies, sonoluminescing microbubbles, as well as astrophysical objects such as white dwarfs and giant planet interiors. Ultracold plasmas provide a unique window to view this physics because they can be accurately measured using lasers. This enables detailed tests of theoretical models. In addition to the theoretical research, a complimentary outreach program will introduce the public to plasma physics through an interactive ""What is Plasma"" demonstration. This will be an integral part of a larger exhibit on the history of space science at the University of Iowa (UI) to be displayed by the UI Natural History Museum, and later as a traveling exhibit in the UI Mobile Museum.<br/><br/>Ultracold plasmas are formed by laser-induced ionization of trapped ultracold atoms, resulting in a charge-neutral mixture of cold ions and electrons. Advances provided by this project are statistical mechanical theory and molecular dynamics simulations capable of accounting for both components of the plasma. Theory and simulations in this relatively new field have focused on one-component models, treating the plasma as a single fluid. The new advances address two-component physics that will become increasingly important as experiments strive for lower temperatures. The particular processes that will be emphasized are equation of state, mutual diffusion, viscosity and energy relaxation rates. The project will focus on understanding how various microphysics processes affect macroscopic transport, including the opposite sign of electron and ion charge, the nonequilibrium nature of electrons and ions, and the dynamic dielectric response of the plasma. The results will provide insights into the fundamental physics of strongly coupled plasmas, contributing to several frontier research fields."

This offers a unique underlying opportunity: to learn how nature uses the interaction of these forces and thereby develop the knowledge that will enable novel bioengineering and bio-inspired systems. The PI's approach will use mathematics, biology and engineering to investigate the hydrodynamic principles that underlie and enable specific animal water entry and exit behaviors, as well as to develop mathematical models for such complex dynamics. The PI will identify how differences in animal movement patterns, body size, and surface characteristics relate to differences in performance in fluid transport (drinking) and fluid force generation (locomotion across or through interfaces). In the modeling of interfacial dynamics, the PI will develop water exit models and also modify the current theory to integrate water entry followed by exit, as suggested by relevant aspects of animal movements. In physical experiments, the effort will quantify processes of water entry and exit with various well-controlled parameters. This approach provides a complete framework that has not been implemented in these systems before. This project will provide interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students by training them in fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology as well as in experimental methods combined with rigorous mathematical modeling."
0.079862,"Coral ecosystems are of significant interest to conservationists because of their remarkable diversity. Coral reefs, in comparison to colonies of soft corals, are composed of hard corals with calcium carbonate skeletons. One significant difference between the two corals is that the soft coral of the family Xeniidae actively pulse, and this energetically expensive behavior has been shown to enhance photosynthesis rates by an order of magnitude. The central goal of this proposal is to describe how these active movements might give soft coral a competitive advantage through augmented photosynthetic rates under certain environmental conditions. The broad focus of this project is to determine how active movements of flexible organisms enhance particle capture and nutrient exchange. In particular the PIs will study species of the family Xeniidae, the pulsing soft corals, using a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments. This work will develop mathematical models to represent poroelastic structures representative of the feathery tentacles of the corals. The PIs will also develop adaptive numerical methods for handling the flux of nutrients at these moving elastic boundaries. Two graduate students and four undergraduates will be trained at the interface of scientific computing, mathematical modeling, and experimental biology. The PIs willrecruit a diverse group of undergraduate students through established mechanisms at each institution. Several educational activities will be implemented to promote computation in biophysics, including the development of quantitative biology labs.<br/><br/>The following specific aims will be addressed in this project: Aim 1: Determine how the pulsing dynamics of a single polyp affects the bulk transport of fluid past the organism and the small scale mixing around the surface of the organism. Aim 2: Determine how the pulsing action enhances particle capture, the exchange of nutrients, and removal of waste. Aim 3: Determine whether or not the group pulsing dynamics are optimized for exchange using network analysis and computational fluid dynamics."
0.18,"Recent decades have seen dramatic improvement in the ability to prepare, manipulate, and control quantum systems with ever increasing fidelity on smaller and smaller time scale and with finer and finer spatial resolution. This has opened new scientific and technological frontiers, for example, in quantum information processing, manipulation of quantum gases, and the control of Rydberg (highly excited) atoms. Though such systems are inherently quantum mechanical, much intuition about the behavior of such systems is based on the underlying classical models for such systems. Classically chaotic models present particular difficulties, due to the extreme complexity and number of classical trajectories. This research seeks to utilize newly developed theoretical (e.g. topological) tools to classify chaotic trajectories in atomic systems and to use these trajectories to compute transport properties (e.g. decay rates) and energy levels of such systems. Such topological tools will also be applied to problems in the control of Rydberg atoms. Through graduate and undergraduate research experiences, this work will also help train the next generation of scientists and help to nurture the newly established campus of the University of California at Merced. UC Merced was opened in 2005 and has already made a significant impact on the economy and education in California's Great Central Valley, the agricultural heart of the state.<br/><br/>The broad theme of this proposal is the analysis and control of atomic systems through a deep structural understanding of chaotic trajectories. This is manifest in the following specific objectives. (i) Building on the prior development and computer implementation of homotopic lobe dynamics---a topological technique for classifying large-amplitude chaotic motion---decay rates and other atomic transport properties will be computed from a detailed analysis of a relatively small number of a system's periodic orbits. (ii) These classical periodic orbit computations will be augmented with quantum phase information to generate semiclassical estimates of individual chaotic energy levels. (iii) Building on the successful use of phase space turnstiles to control the ionization of quasi-1D Rydberg states, the turnstile technique will be applied to the more challenging control problem of circular Bohr-like Rydberg wavepackets.<br/><br/>The well-established power of periodic orbit techniques has not been widely applied to ""real world"" problems due in large part to the difficulty of characterizing and computing the relevant orbits, especially in complex systems with a mixture of chaos and regularity. Successfully computing classical transport rates for mixed systems would thus dramatically expand the applicability of periodic orbit techniques. Furthermore, using these techniques to estimate individual quantum eigenvalues would address a long-standing question in quantum chaos: is it possible to semiclassically compute quantum spectra for general chaotic systems? Finally, applying phase-space turnstiles to 3D Bohr-like wavepackets would provide a new laboratory mechanism to rapidly control and engineer such states, e.g. increase or decrease the principle quantum number. It would also improve the general understanding of chaotic transport in higher dimensional systems."
0.54,"In this project the PI will investigate the role of contractile actin networks in driving shape changes and morphogenesis in Drosophila embryos. Contractile actin networks are increasingly being shown to play a central role in fundamental biological processes involving cellular transport including cell division and embryogenesis. A physics-based approach that integrates quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy data with mechanistic, physics based modeling is proposed to investigate these processes. A major challenge posed by this data-driven modeling approach is the unbiased evaluation of competing physical models. To meet this challenge, a Bayesian inference framework is explored that models noise in the data generation process to systematically test competing hypotheses of transport mechanisms. Specific contributions of this research project include a unified, physical understanding of how dynamic, contractile actin meshworks operate to transport organelles and entire cells during basic biological processes including cell division and embryogenesis. Further, a data-driven approach to bridging physics-based transport models with fluorescence microscopy data sets is explored that will be of broad utility to the biological physics community. <br/><br/>Contractile actin networks are protein networks present in eukaryotic cells that play an important role in cell division, cell movement, and tissue development. However, a mechanistic, physical understanding of how short time-scale, dynamic contractions of actin at the subcellular scale interact mechanically to coordinate cellular transport at larger length and time-scales does not exist. Resolving this mechanism requires a quantitative, physics-based approach that models contraction-driven transport at multiple scales ranging from single cells to collections thereof. The present project is at the forefront of this research area, which is of great importance to our scientific understanding the roles of contractile actin networks in development. <br/><br/>Educational initiatives being advanced by the PI include undergraduate and graduate curriculum enhancement, including the new graduate elective offered in the Department of Biological Engineering, Physical Biology, and a new Institute-wide seminar series in Biophysics at MIT. As a result of the present research project, the PI is establishing a webserver for objective, Bayesian analysis of transport measurements to infer physical transport models in a variety of scientific disciplines, updating a webserver for integration of physics-based modeling into molecular animations of proteins, protein assemblies, and cytoskeletal dynamics for educational purposes, and developing a virtual laboratory in molecular and cellular biophysics for students at City on a Hill, a local charter high school serving under-represented minorities in the Boston area. Educational and research activities of the PI will be further disseminated via continuous rotation of undergraduate students from the Biological Engineering Research Experience for Undergraduates program and MIT's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, as well as from developing foreign countries."

REU students are integrated into small teams of undergraduate researchers working closely with a faculty mentor, who nurtures their experimental, analytical, and communication skills. Students also experience physics in action by visiting regional facilities, where they interact with practicing physicists. Active recruitment at community colleges expands research opportunities for underrepresented students and for those with limited research prospects.

0.150107,"Experimental data both in plants and animals indicate that the vasculature permeating a wide array of tissues and organs, such as plant leaves and the brain, is hierarchically organized and dominated by nested cycles. The PI will investigate the physical principles behind the emergence of such hierarchically organized, reticulate circulatory systems. Complex multicellular life would be inconceivable without the evolution of space filling circulatory systems to distribute nutrients and collect waste. Vascular systems are ubiquitous and they have some common features, but also distinctive differences. Taming that complexity can provide intuition about ecological adaptations in plants to deal with intermittent or long term drought. The work will also offer a profound understanding on how subtle modifications in human vasculature are associated with diseases such as hypertension and how events like stroke affect the circulation in the brain. The PI will work with education experts at her institution to integrate a research approach into a classroom setting at the introductory course level and expose undergraduates very early on to authentic research experiences. In addition, in partnership with the Biology department, she will design and implement a pilot program to create a handheld device application for use by the general public that allows users to scan barcodes and access information about plants specimens at the botanical gardens on campus.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate the physical principles behind the emergence of such hierarchically organized, reticulate circulatory systems. The work will focus on three key thrusts (a) How do the loopy, hierarchical vascular structures across different taxa and kingdoms compare with each other and how specific is the detailed architecture of a vascular system to an organ or a species? (b) Why did these hierarchically nested structures emerge independently several times in both plants and animals? (c) How is hierarchical nestedness maintained in animal vascular systems where vascular remodeling predicts heavy pruning of the vascular structures? The PI's work will be primarily theoretical and computational, but motivated and driven by experimental data, acquired by collaborating teams (animal data) and undergraduates (plant data) under the PI's supervision. Active participation of undergraduate students in research is the core element of the PI's educational plan."
0.27235,"Unlike the planets orbiting the sun, the electrons that whorl around the nucleus inside atoms are not allowed to do so at arbitrary distances. Quantum theory prescribes that only very specific average distances from the nucleus are allowed. This limitation gives rise to the specific colors of light that atoms respond to when hit with a laser beam. By tuning the laser precisely, one can find the specific colors that are in resonance with the orbiting electron, and thereby learn about the intricate details of the internal structure of the atom. While most atoms have many electrons, making the task of understanding the complicated pattern of orbits relatively difficult, hydrogen and helium have only one and two electrons, respectively, and hence are amenable to very precise theoretical prediction. By comparing these very precise predictions to similarly precise measurements, one can test whether or not the theory of ""quantum electrodynamics"" (the fundamental theory of light, atoms, and most of the rest of the ordinary world around us) is really correct, or only approximately so. The group supported by this grant plans to develop and deploy the laser sources and techniques that will allow improved tests of the quantum theory described above. If the theory is found to be correct at the new level of accuracy, the results of the experiments can then be used to determine the size of the nucleus in hydrogen and helium. A comparison of these sizes with what is known or predicted in nuclear physics will then provide a test of the scientific understanding of these simple nuclei. In this way, these experiments bridge the gap between the atom and the nucleus, and test the consistency of two regimes of physics which differ in length scale by a factor of 10,000. Laser sources and optical techniques are ubiquitous in science, technology and the economy, so training of students in this area provides valuable expertise, and has the potential to develop generally important laser sources and optical techniques for a wide range of applications. <br/><br/><br/>This research develops laser technology and precision laser techniques. It applies them to the study of helium fine structure and the precise determination of hydrogen and helium nuclear sizes. Optical methods are developed which involve high-speed electro-optic modulation of a stabilized semiconductor laser, creating microwave tunable frequency side bands on the laser. These side bands can then be used to drive and determine the transitions frequencies of the triplet 2S -> 2P in helium 3 and 4, and 1S->2S in hydrogen and its isotopes. The physics of the laser interaction with hydrogen and helium atoms is carefully studied to obtain the unperturbed frequencies of studied atomic transitions. Results will be obtained with sufficient precision to provide important comparisons with theory. These include (1) the atomic theory and computation of electron-electron interactions in helium, the simplest multi-electron atom, and (2) the nuclear interactions and computations that predict the observed size of few-nucleon nuclei. In particular, isotopic shifts in these experimental results allow the charge radii of helium-3 and tritium to be determined and compared to predictions of few-nucleon theory and the underlying description of the nuclear force."
0.75,"The recently built Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) has become the premier lunar laser ranging (LLR) facility in the world, delivering one-millimeter range precision between Earth and Moon as a way to test General Relativity. General Relativity makes specific predictions about the shape of the lunar orbit, so that we may use the Moon as a laboratory, made possible by the reflectors left on the Moon by the Apollo astronauts and unmanned Soviet rovers. The goal of this work is to extend high-quality LLR observations over an additional three-year period, simultaneously collecting calibrated measurements of local gravity well enough to determine site displacements at the millimeter level. In tandem, an intensive effort will be initiated to advance the solar system model to a state that can take advantage of millimeter-quality data. It is by comparison to a complete and sophisticated model that questions relating to gravity, geophysics, and lunar physics can be explored. Though not the main focus, knowledge of the lunar interior stands to gain the most from APOLLO, as the experiment routinely acquires 4 to 5 reflectors in one session, providing exquisite measurements of the lunar orientation and distortion. But this refined knowledge of the moon will also facilitate understanding of how the moon moves in its orbit, as such information is crucial to determining the path of the Moon's center of mass through space.<br/><br/>LLR tests many fundamental aspects of gravity, like the equivalence principle, the constancy of gravity, gravitomagnetism, and the inverse-square law. Improving our knowledge of gravity therefore informs a diverse range of cosmologists, astrophysicists, particle physicists, and string theorists. This effort will also contribute to Earth and planetary science, especially via the inclusion of the superconducting gravimeter data. The open-source solar-system analysis code emerging from the project will provide an interesting platform for analyzing a wide range of data sets, including radar ranging in the solar system, Doppler radar to spacecraft around the solar system, pulsar timing experiments, etc. The same platform can form the basis of covariant studies for future proposed space missions that aim to test fundamental physics. Additionally, graduate student and postdoctoral training is a valuable component of the total effort. Finally, APOLLO will continue its strong tradition of public outreach, including featured appearances on popular television shows."
0.15,"In the past thirty years super-massive black holes (millions or billions of times the mass of our sun) have been observed in the centers of numerous galaxies. Many stars orbit these black holes and emit gravitational radiation which causes the star to spiral inward and eventually to be swallowed by the super-massive black hole. The characteristics of the gravitational radiation, from both the inspiral and the eventual in-fall of a star, will be theoretically determined. The analysis of data from future gravitational radiation observations will then provide tremendous insight and understanding of strong gravitational fields, the stars in the centers of galaxies and the super-massive black hole itself.<br/><br/>Our place in the universe can only be studied via physics and astronomy. These fundamental sciences catch the attention of the best and the brightest of students.

This project aims at understanding some aspects of non-equilibrium systems. Remarkably, it turns out that concepts and techniques developed in String Theory can be used to attack this fundamental problem. This project will use these new tools to understand universal features of this process, i.e., features which are common to a wide class of systems. As such, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the understanding of universal physical phenomena. The broader impacts resulting from this project will be to enhance the quality of undergraduate and graduate physics education, and to support frontier physics research in the Kentucky region. <br/><br/>At a more technical level, Das will study non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly coupled quantum field theories using gauge-gravity duality. In addition, gauge-gravity duality will be used to understand the meaning of yet another non-equilibrium system: the expanding universe.

0.15,"This award supports the collaboration between researchers P. Nikolic at George Mason University and M. Rigol at Georgetown University. Ultracold atoms are a novel physical system whose properties can be dominated by a correlated behavior of many interacting particles. The theoretical discovery and characterization of correlated quantum states that may be difficult to obtain in any other system is the fundamental purpose of this project. The main focus are unconventional paired insulators and superfluids stabilized by nearly resonant interactions in optical lattices. Using simple microscopic models that are theoretically tractable and routinely realized in ultracold atom laboratories, this research will advance the many-body quantum theory in the atomic physics context, and analyze the emergence of correlations commonly found in complicated solid state materials. Our understanding of high temperature superconductivity is expected to benefit from the inter-disciplinary nature of this research, while the results will have potential applications to quantum engineering and high-precision measurements. <br/><br/>A broad outreach effort included in this project will benefit from the location of George Mason and Georgetown Universities in the metropolitan Washington DC area.

0.062,"Diatomic molecules, consisting of only two atoms, are the simplest molecules that can exist. Yet, although the structure of diatomic molecules is comparatively simple, the molecule, with the two atoms bound together through the overlapping structure of the electrons surrounding the atoms, demonstrates a rich internal structure that can influence the behavior of a system in which the diatomic molecule interacts with other molecules surrounding it. This collaborative theoretical research program is aimed at understanding how the microscopic structure of diatomic molecules influences the bulk behavior of ultracold molecular gases. The goals of the program are to understand how the details of the molecular interactions and internal molecular structure play a role in emergent bulk phenomena in molecular Bose-Einstein condensates, and to provide guidance and motivation for ongoing experiments. Additionally, this research is designed to foster collaborations between scientists with specializations in few-body and many-body quantum physics, and integrate undergraduate student researchers in the entirety of the research process. In particular, students are involved in developing theoretical tools and implementing numerical calculations, and are presenting at scientific meetings and preparing manuscripts for submission to peer reviewed journals. <br/><br/>The focus of this project is quantum degenerate gases of bosonic molecules in which the spatial and microscopic degrees of freedom of the molecules influence the bulk system behavior. Unlike many conventional condensed matter or solid state systems, quantum degenerate gases of ultracold molecule provide us with a great deal of control over both their microscopic and bulk properties, and they permit the investigation of collective, emergent quantum phenomena in unique contexts. Recent experimental progress towards the realization of quantum degeneracy in samples of diatomic molecules promises to significantly enhance the utility of ultracold quantum systems. This research is motivated by the idea that the interplay of spatial and microscopic degrees of freedom can lead to a variety of rich behaviors in quantum many-body systems, such as an interaction driven spin-orbit coupling at the two-body level and state-dependent dipolar interactions that exhibit strong dependence on confinement geometry. Using mean-field and perturbative quantum field theory methods, this research (1) generalizes a two-state model of a molecular Bose gas to account for realistic experimental scenarios, including finite trapping geometries, arbitrary polarization fields, and short-range interactions; (2) extends the model to incorporate more microscopic states and apply it to describe Bose gases of rigid rotor molecules with large effective spin degrees of freedom; and (3) incorporates beyond-dipolar interactions, such as quadrupolar interactions and lossy collisions, into the model. The long term goals of this work are to develop a rigorous theoretical understanding of how the microscopic structure of diatomic molecules influence intermolecular interactions, and thereby play a role in emergent quantum many-body phenomena, and to provide guidance and motivation for experiments with quantum degenerate molecules that will be available in the near future."
0.08,"The advances of modern electrical devices are often driven by the discovery of new quantum materials. In many materials, the coupling between electron spins and their motional degrees of freedom (linear momentum and orbital angular momentum), i.e., spin-orbit coupling, plays a crucial role in the underlying material properties. Understanding the effects of spin-orbit coupling in a controllable platform could provide important guidelines for future design and discovery of new quantum materials with desirable properties and functionalities. In this context, ultra-cold atomic gases offer such a controllable platform for material design and discovery with unprecedented level of control and precision in experiments. Previous research has realized one type of spin-orbit coupling (the coupling between spin and linear momentum) for ultra-cold atoms, which now becomes one major research frontier in physics. However, another important and fundamental type of spin-orbit coupling, the coupling between spin and orbital angular momentum (SOAM coupling), has not been explored for ultra-cold atomic gases. In this project, the generation of SOAM coupling for ultra-cold atoms and their applications in engineering new quantum states will be studied. The study of such highly controllable SOAM coupled cold atomic platform will in turn influence the future electronic material design and discovery. This work will not only pave the way for coherent control of cold atomic systems for many important applications (e.g., material design, quantum computation, precision measurement, etc.), but will also influence fundamental research in cold atomic and condensed matter physics. <br/><br/>The major objective of this project is to investigate the generation and applications of SOAM coupling in ultra-cold atomic gases using higher order Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) laser modes. Another goal is to study the cold atomic physics with spatially varying spin-linear-momentum (SLM) coupling using higher order Hermit-Gaussian (HG)) laser modes. Specific tasks include: 1) Study the generation of SOAM coupling or spatially varying SLM coupling using LG or HG Raman laser modes; 2) Investigate ground states and collective dynamics of cold atoms in the presence of SOAM coupling and HG-SLM coupling; c) Explore novel quantum phases induced by SOAM or HG-SLM couplings for both bosons and fermions. Various numerical and analytical methods (e.g., mean field approximation, time-evolving-block-decimation algorithm, perturbation theory, etc.) will be applied. The work will provide a diverse platform for both graduate and undergraduate students to explore theoretical cold atomic and condensed matter physics. In addition, this effort will include outreach activities for K-12 students and involvement of students from under-represented groups, such as women and minority students."
0.075,"Some of the simplest objects making up the world as we experience it on a day-to-day basis are atoms and molecules. These atoms and molecules consist of nuclei made up of protons and neutrons surrounded by a sea of electrons. Interactions among atoms and molecules, especially chemical interactions, involve the motion of the electrons. Exploring the dynamics of this motion, leading to interactions, has been a major focus of research since the discovery of quantum mechanics, whose laws allow us to calculate this motion. When an atom or molecule consists of a large number of electrons, the calculations can only be approximate and are extremely difficult, while at the same time being important for understanding aspects of chemistry. This project will focus on calculating a subset of these interactions. The research will be carried out at an undergraduate institution, offering the possibility of a true research experience for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will examine the consequences of correlated electron dynamics of small atoms and molecules with more than two electrons in order to better understand the similarities and differences in different target atoms and molecules that result from having many electrons. Electron correlation is a fundamental phenomena with great impacts on the behavior and structure of all matter. Many decades of research towards developing more accurate ways of accounting for the non-approximated dynamics of electronic motion in even the simplest atoms and molecules have been focused on bound states (energy levels of atoms, potential curves of molecules, etc.) but the consequences of this correlation also greatly impact the resulting double continua when two electrons are ejected from a target by photons. These correlated electron interactions are fundamental to the organization and structure of matter at the atomic level and continue to be of vital importance to study and better understand. Broader consequences of pursuing more a complete understanding of electron correlation in simple atoms and molecules with more than two electrons would impact many other fields of study, including chemistry, atomic and molecular physics, molecular biology, and material science, to name a few. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the impacts of these fundamental electronic correlations for non-trivial atoms and molecules with more than two electrons in order to better understand the ways that the initial and final states of the electrons that remain bound to the atom or diatomic molecule can affect the two photoejected electrons leaving the others behind. Theoretical calculations describing these events from first principles will be applied to targets with many electrons that continue to interact with the fully correlated electrons before, during and after the photoionization event. It is hoped that this project can further elucidate the broader consequences of how all of the electrons bound to an atom or molecule can affect those that will be moved into the continuum and how consequences of symmetry and electronic structure impacts outgoing electrons. Both time-dependent and time-independent approaches will be explored. The work is closely coupled to kinematically complete experimental investigations of these systems."

The research to be done will include theoretical studies as well as laboratory demonstrations. The projected results include dramatic simplifications of communication techniques that can come from exploitation of the principle of ""entanglement"", previously not associated with macroscopic light beams. Entanglement refers to the situation in which widely separated particles cannot be described independently of each other (or, mathematically, when the whole is not equal to the sum of its parts).<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to demonstrate the utility of entanglement at the non-quantum level. The simple existence of non-quantum entanglement is quickly becoming accepted. Utility will come, for example, from acquiring the ability to use classically entangled macroscopic light beams for communications protocols. This will avoid the strict requirements associated with generation and management and registration of individual photons. In practice, below-threshold diode laser light will provide macroscopically entangled light beams with exactly classical (thermal Gaussian) statistics, and power meters will provide detection capability without individual photon detection. This combination has already been demonstrated in the laboratory. Desirable classical features are the ability to obtain entanglement beyond the two-party level with ordinary lab devices, as well as the existence of stochastic randomness, available in every partially polarized macroscopic light beam. A new theoretical description of three-party additive entanglement inequalities, distinct from tangle-based monogamy, has already emerged from ongoing preliminary work. Two-way beneficial exchanges with the fields of quantum information and quantum optics appear desirable and feasible, for example in implementing protocols for optical multi-mode entanglement swapping at the macroscopic level.Experimental verification will elucidate the potential benefits of this new theory in practical applications."

All of these investigations shall be carried out in close collaboration with experimental groups in an effort to insure the quantitative accuracy of the theoretical methodologies developed. In addition, the PI will continue to study the interaction of radiation with confined atoms and ions, e.g., confined in fullerenes. Of great importance will be the realistic handling of the confining potential, e.g., treating all 60 carbon atoms of C60. The results will provide further insight into the nature of these fundamental atomic processes that are of importance in plasma physics and controlled thermonuclear research, atmospheric, solar, and astrophysics, radiation and radiological physics and therapy, and for studies of x-ray laser mechanics.

Control of quantum systems -- electrons, atoms and molecules is one of the 'grand challenges' of modern physics. This research cuts across many disciplines in physics, mathematics and chemistry. Microscopic quantum systems can be understood and controlled by understanding and controlling the analogous macroscopic classical systems. New discoveries in classical mechanics can be used to show how to obtain similar control over quantum systems. For example, the theory of chaotic transport was first introduced to study systems of three bodies interacting under gravity, and has more recently been used to design spacecraft trajectories, examine orbits of comets, study transport of meteors from Mars to the Earth, and learn about mixing in fluids. It will be used to study escape of atoms from cavities, escape of electrons from highly excited atoms, and transport of atoms through nanojunctions. These are systems which have only a few degrees of freedom, for which the interparticle forces are known and controllable, and on which precise measurements can be made. This research is also connected to technology. The mechanisms of escape of electrons from atoms is similar to the mechanisms of escape of electrons from nanojunctions ('designer atoms') and similar to the mechanisms of escape of photons from optical resonators. In addition, highly excited states of atoms can be used as infrared detectors, and chaotic ionization processes have been used to make a streak camera. The field of nonlinear dynamics is excellent for introducing students to research. As soon as students learn elementary aspects of Newton's Laws, they can begin computing trajectories, and analyzing their structure.<br/><br/>A new phenomenon in classical and quantum integrable systems called monodromy will be studied. Also new phenomena associated with pumping ultracold atoms from one reservoir to another, 'Ballistic Atom Pumps', has been discovered and will be further explored. Computations predicting future observations of the 'tennis-racket flip' in isolated molecules will be carried out. Finally dynamical control theory will be applied to understand respiration in premature infants. For example, it is believed that periodic apneas occur when time-delays in a control loop throw the system into oscillation; this theory will be compared with data provided by University of Virginia."
0.15,"This research program will study a new approach to lasers that promises to produce light with coherence and wavelength control that is two factors of ten better than any system available today. The idea is based on superradiant emission, where an ensemble of atoms with an extremely narrow atomic transition can undergo quantum synchronization. This is like a laser except the coherence is stored in the atoms rather than the light. <br/><br/>The past decade has seen remarkable progress in the development of atomic clocks that utilize ultranarrow optical transitions. These systems are now reaching precision and accuracy thresholds that open up many potential future applications, including advanced optical communications, gravitational mapping and geodesy, next-generation time and frequency standards, and advanced navigation and global positioning. The best atomic clocks today and the lasers that probe them are the highest quality coherent oscillators that have ever existed, with intrinsic frequencies in the optical domain and coherence times that can now exceed minutes. The challenge going forward is to continue this impressive technology development and pursue the broad spectrum of practical applications.<br/><br/>The ultranarrow intercombination lines of group-II-like atoms confined in optical cavities provide a platform for a revolutionary technology based on the steady-state superradiance from macroscopic atomic ensembles. Such systems promise to dramatically improve atomic clocks since the coherence time could be orders of magnitude longer than the best reference-cavity stabilized lasers achieved to date. Storing the coherence in the atoms rather than the light overcomes the intrinsic sensitivity of reference-cavity stabilized lasers to cavity length noise, which otherwise translates directly into frequency noise on the emitted light.<br/><br/>This research program explores this idea to contribute to the general theory of quantum optics systems and more explicitly to the understanding of the quantum theory of the optical laser in the extreme bad-cavity limit. Collaboration with experiment is a key aspect allowing the results to impact directly in the development of applications and devices. The specific goal is to quantitatively layout the landscape that bridges steady-state superradiance and lasing and to thereby explore the variety of potential implementations. A major challenge will be to identify and mitigate quantum noise sources that adversely affect the spectral coherence of the output field."
0.241147,"This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in Physics at the University of Chicago. The award will support ten students per year for ten weeks of summer research. The core of the program for each student is a well-defined 10- week summer research project under supervision of a University of Chicago faculty member. Projects are distributed among: high-energy, cosmic-ray and astrophysics, general relativity, condensed-matter physics, non-linear dynamics and biophysics. A series of lectures presented by faculty provides an overview of some of the most important research topics currently pursued in these areas of physics. <br/><br/>The interns will learn to communicate science by submitting a written report and making an oral presentation on their work. The program provides students with exposure to the breadth and unity of physics. It brings the REU students into contact with one another. This creates the peer interactions among students that increase the program's excitement and vitality, and helps prepare them for future careers in Physics and in STEM fields in general."
0.105,"This theoretical research program, to be performed by a collaboration between Dr. Mark Edwards of Georgia Southern University and Dr. Charles W. Clark of the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI), an institute run jointly by the University of Maryland and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will be devoted to the design and study of new ""atom circuits"" for the purpose of developing an ultra-precise rotation sensor and for gaining a greater fundamental understanding of quantum matter at ultra-cold temperatures. An ""atom circuit"" is an atomic gas confined by laser light and held at temperatures just a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero. Gases of identical atoms confined at such low temperatures cause the constituent atoms to exhibit their wave-like quantum nature and the gas can form a state called a ""Bose-Einstein condensate"" (BEC). A BEC is a system of identical atoms all of whose matter-wave shapes are the same. Bose-Einstein-condensed gases can be manipulated by the confining laser light into arbitrary shapes such as rings and the atoms can be made to flow around circuits within the confinement. Such systems are called ""atom circuits"". These circuits have the potential to be at the heart of quantum devices that can sense rotations and magnetic and gravitational fields in an ultra-precise way. This research program will design new atom circuits and develop theoretical tools for characterizing and probing them. This work will performed in close collaboration with experimental researchers at JQI/NIST.<br/><br/>This research program is designed to enable two talented Georgia Southern University undergraduate physics majors to gain cutting-edge research experience in the area of ultra-cold atom theory thus advancing discovery while promoting learning. Edwards and the Georgia Southern students will communicate with both the JQI research group headed by Charles Clark and with members of the Laser Cooling and Trapping group at NIST, headed by Gretchen Campbell, using Google Hangout. Georgia Southern students will attend the weekly Quantum Information/Bose-Einstein meetings at NIST via the internet. The project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by maintaining an established collaboration among an undergraduate institution (GA Southern), a national laboratory (NIST), and a major research university (University of Maryland). Broad dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding will be accomplished by bringing distinguished scientists to the Georgia Southern University campus to present colloquia and by developing visualization capabilities with the new digital projection system in the Georgia Southern Planetarium. Finally, new atom-circuits have the potential to be at the heart of a new generation of practical devices that will find applications in navigation, metrology, geodesy, and studies of the fundamental properties of matter.<br/><br/>This collaboration will conduct a theoretical exploration of various designs of atom circuits formed by confining a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) gas in an optical potential consisting of a horizontally oriented red-detuned light sheet and an arbitrary two-dimensional potential within this plane created by various red- and blue-detuned laser beams. Advances in optical trapping technology have enabled the creation of ultra-cold atom systems strongly confined in the vertical direction while being subject to an arbitrary potential in the horizontal plane. New atom-circuit potentials will be devised and studied. Studies of these systems will include (1) circuit behavior, (2) development of simple models of circuit operation analogous to Kirchhoff's rules for electronic circuits, (3) theoretical development of possible experimental probes to measure parameters appearing in these simple models, (4) effects of the environment, such as finite temperature, on circuit operation. The major tools that will be developed will be the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin (ZNG) theory in the laboratory and rotating frame. The ZNG theory treats the system as a combination of a BEC and a thermal cloud that can be weakly perturbed. The result is a finite-temperature, non-equilibrium system."
0.225,"The project will develop new dynamical methods to control the resonant light-matter interaction through modulation in time and/or in space of the parameters of the resonant atomic transition (frequencies and/or line widths) by means of the strong off-resonant control field. It includes the development of (i) a new highly efficient method for the formation of the VUV and XUV attosecond pulses via the spectrum broadening by means of the temporal modulation of the atomic parameters and (ii) a method to produce and to control optically the photonic structures in a homogeneous atomic media via special modulation of the refractive index induced by the strong laser field. A theory of the VUV and XUV radiation transformation during its propagation through an optically thick resonantly absorbing atomic medium, dynamically perturbed by a strong IR or optical laser radiation, will be developed. It will advance understanding and control of the strong ultrafast light-matter interactions, including appreciation of the role of the resonant, interference, and cooperative effects in such interactions. <br/><br/>Attosec pulses provide a unique ultrafast tool for recording and control of the electronic motion in atoms, molecules, and nanostructures, leading to profound applications in chemistry and biology, medicine and energetics. Development of the new method of attosecond pulse formation with the pulse characteristics superior or complementary to those produced by the current high-harmonic-generation technique will further push those strategically and fundamentally important applications. Development of the new method for an optical production of the photonic structures in the homogeneously distributed atomic ensembles with the widely variable parameters, determined by the intensity and frequency of the control field, will essentially extend the applications of such structures for the control and manipulation of the flow of light. The graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in these interdisciplinary fields of atomic, molecular, and optical science, learning and developing the methods of coherent control of the light-matter interaction in the ultrafast strong-field regimes based on the modern laser technologies. Collaboration with experimental groups will be initiated, aiming at implementation of the newly developed dynamical methods of coherent control in the experimental investigations."
0.42,"The goal of this project is to investigate strongly interacting ultracold atoms and molecules. The PI will study novel few-body states and search for new exact results for the many-body systems. Most results will be very quantitative and free from uncontrolled approximations. There are a number of topics which will be studied, including three- and five-body Efimov states, states where the atom is constrained in one or more dimensions, for example near a surface, and atomic or molecular states near a Feshbach resonance. In addition, the PI will derive exact relations for strongly interacting Fermi gases and density profiles for quantum gases near a wall.<br/><br/>With the advance of technology, mankind can now actively manipulate the microscopic world. It is particularly useful to cool atoms and molecules to temperatures that are billions of times closer to absolute zero than the background of the universe. High precision atomic clocks, for example, are only possible with sufficiently cold atoms. In order to study these systems, one must solve the Schrödinger equation, which is challenging even for just a few atoms. In many cases, the lack of an adequate solution has hampered the understanding of the behaviors of ultracold atoms and molecules. The new research directions in this project will provide a guide for the ongoing experiments on ultracold atoms and molecules. Because of the quantum similarity between cold atoms and other particles, such as electrons in solid state materials and protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei (they all satisfy the Schrödinger equation), theoretical research of ultracold atoms and molecules may also shed new light on material science and nuclear science. The PI plans to integrate his research and educational activities by creating a special topics course on Few-Body Quantum Physics and training doctoral students who will learn advanced scientific and mathematical techniques."

This work will attract and train talented students and postdocs in this active area of research. Particular effort is made to attract women and minorities to those fields. In addition, many of the effects studied in this work have the potential to impact future applications of quantum computing/simulation as well as nano-engineering."
0.320784,"This award supports a theoretical program to examine in detail collisions of photons (light), electrons, and heavy charged particles with atoms, ions, and molecules. Highly sophisticated numerical methods and computer programs will be developed and then applied to perform benchmark calculations, whose predictions will be compared with data from state-of-the-art experiments currently being performed in various laboratories worldwide.<br/><br/>The interpretation of the results will lead to a deeper understanding of highly correlated processes on the submicroscopic atomic scale. Of particular interest are processes in ultrashort intense laser fields, at a time scale that allows for the study, and ultimately the control, of electron behavior in chemical processes. Finally, the project provides accurate atomic data, which are needed in many applications, such as modeling plasmas for the lighting industry, processes in planetary atmospheres, and the physics of stars and lasers."
0.15,"This award supports theoretical research on dipolar Fermi gases. In such ultracold gases of molecules, interactions between the electric dipole moments of the molecules lead to a rich array of unusual quantum phases. They belong to the latest breeds of quantum matter engineered in laboratories by precise control of molecules using laser light. The system has the potential to simulate and solve some profound mysteries regarding strongly interacting fermions with long-range interactions. The research will chart out the phase diagrams of dipolar fermions on two-dimensional optical lattices. The goal is to discover and understand novel phases of matter and predict their experimental signatures. The results can provide input for current and future experiments. The knowledge acquired will contribute to the understanding of interacting fermions in general, a subject of fundamental importance to physics and material science. Better understanding and consequently better control over the system will help to achieve other goals of ultracold molecule research, such as precision measurement and quantum computation.<br/><br/>The award will stimulate deeper dialogue between many body physics and Atomic, Molecular, and Optical physics at the interdisciplinary frontier of ultracold molecules.

0.08,"Simple rules can lead to complicated behavior. This maxim is particularly true in quantum mechanics, the theory describing microscopic objects such as atoms. Tools of theoretical physics will be used to determine how such exotic behavior emerges in ultracold atomic gases. While these studies may potentially lead to novel applications in areas such as quantum computing, metrology, or materials science, the direct goal of this set of projects is to test fundamental concepts about emergent physics in quantum systems. There are three disconnected lines of research. First, when atoms are confined to tight tubes they behave differently than atoms which are free to move in three dimensions. The cross-over between this exotic one-dimensional state and more conventional three-dimensional physics will be studied. Second, an exotic state was recently discovered in electronic systems. Dubbed ""topological insulators,"" these materials have insulating bulks, but conducting surface modes. Moreover the surface modes behave in unconventional ways. The cold atom analogs of these systems will be studied. Finally, the cold atom analogs of electron systems with magnetic impurities will be studied. Metals with magnetic impurities display a number of important phenomena, some of which are not completely understood. The goal is to produce a controlled system for testing various theoretical ideas.<br/><br/>This project has three research directions which will advance understanding of cold atoms, and many-body physics. These are chosen to dovetail with recent experimental and theoretical development. The first research direction will involve the dimensional crossover between 1D and 3D in a superfluid partially polarized Fermi gas. The 1D system displays a fluctuating version of the FFLO state. There is hope that true long-range FFLO order can be stabilized for intermediate confinement. The PI will use the inhomogeneous Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations to study this crossover. The second research direction will involve lattice defects in an artificial atomic Chern insulator. There is a potentially transformitive conjecture that such defects are related to the fractional quantum Hall effect. Much of this physics can be revealed by numerical studies of the single-particle Schrodinger equation. Even if the conjecture is incorrect, the study will teach us about these defects, which are important in solid state systems. The third research project will involve attempts to see Kondo physics in cold atoms. By studying this problem in cold atoms, the goal is to obtain a more direct insight into this exotic physics. Greens function techniques will be used for this latter project."

The meeting will bring together computational physicists, chemists, mathematicians and computational scientists to understand and develop the tools of uncertainty quantification applied to theory and simulation relevant to systems ranging from materials processing to astrophysical plasmas. The modeling in these systems is critically dependent on data validation, verification, uncertainty analysis and quantification. This meeting represents an opportunity to exploit advances in the science of uncertainty quantification to improve our understanding in these systems."
0.075,"Ultracold molecules offer unprecedented opportunities for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, quantum information processing, and controlled interrogation of molecular events, including chemical reactivity in the ultimate quantum regime. A quantitative description of their collisions and interactions requires a quantum mechanical approach, but it is computationally challenging for many molecules of interest to current cooling and trapping experiments. The primary difficulty is the proliferation in the number of quantum states and degrees of freedom to be included in the calculations and the sensitivity of results to both short-range and long-range intermolecular forces. This work will develop new theoretical and computational tools that go beyond existing models for the treatment of chemical reactions at temperatures below 1 degree Kelvin. It will significantly enhance theoretical capabilities for the description of chemical reactions at cold and ultracold temperatures and provide an efficient tool for quantized studies of chemical reactions at low temperatures. The proposed research transcends disciplinary boundaries, and the computational algorithms developed will also be equally applicable to molecular processes in diverse environments ranging from atmospheric chemistry to astrophysics. Funding of this project will also contribute to future workforce development in Science and Technology.<br/><br/>This project deals with the development of accurate and efficient methods to study chemical reactions and energy transfer in cold molecular collisions. The full Close-Coupling (CC) method will continue to be developed and optimized. A hybrid method that uses full CC at short range and Multi-Channel Quantum Defect Theory (MQDT) at long range will also be developed and benchmarked. These methods will be applied to a number of reactions including F + H2 and OH + H. In addition, the PI will explore the importance of the geometric phase in chemical reaction dynamics using the O + OH reaction at the ultracold limit as a illustrative case."
0.2,"Recent experimental progress in ultra-cold atomic/molecular gases and unconventional optical lattices has allowed us to push our exploration of the quantum world to a new limit, where a quantum many-particle system can be controlled and measured with exceptional precision. In modern quantum physics, one key development is the geometric/topological interpretation of quantum systems, from which topological field theory and the concept of topological states of matter are developed. The main objective of this investigation is to improve our knowledge on quantum topological states of matter by realizing, characterizing and understanding topologically-nontrivial quantum states in ultra-cold atomic gases. The physics principles revealed in this investigation may shed new light on other branches of scientific research including solid state physics, quantum information and quantum computation. In addition, the research plan contains an education component, which promotes awareness towards the research on novel quantum states and provides the general public, especially the next generation, novel knowledge on the future development of quantum computation. This setup offers an ideal platform for the investigation of quantum many-body systems and their topological properties.<br/><br/>The investigation contains a combined effort of theoretical and numerical studies utilizing modern theoretical techniques such as quantum field theory and exact numerical methods. By identifying topological states that are most suitable for realization in atomic systems, the study will provide direct guidance for experimental investigations. In addition, the unique properties of atomic gases will allow us to stabilize and to study novel topological states, which have never been realized in other systems. By studying these unconventional topological states, new principles of physics can emerge and will be studied."
0.18,"Atoms that interact strongly at low energy exhibit universal behavior that does not depend on details of atomic physics. The development of methods for trapping atoms, cooling them to ultralow temperatures, and manipulating their interaction strengths has made universality of practical importance for controlling atoms and molecules. The ultimate goal of this project is to predict the behavior of few-body and many-body systems consisting of strongly-interacting ultracold atoms and the weakly-bound molecules formed by these atoms. Although this project is focussed primarily on ultracold atoms, universality ensures that the results will also be applicable to other fields of science, including nuclear physics, high energy physics, condensed matter physics, and astrophysics.<br/><br/>This award will be used primarily to support a graduate student who will be working on this research project. The training received by the graduate student in carrying out the research will contribute to the building of a diverse scientific workforce.

0.21,"Information processing (IP) is at the heart of the modern economy. The cutting edge of IP is a new paradigm -- ""quantum information processing,"" (QIP) -- where bits are encoded in microscopic states of light and matter. The nonintuitive properties of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement allow for computations, communications, and measurements beyond the power and any existing IP device. This grant studies the implementation of QIP with atomic gasses cooled to ultralow temperatures. Laser beams act as a quantum databus to entangle atoms with one another, and as a mechanism for reading out the information. The control of atoms is studied to create new quantum states that have the unique properties necessary for QIP. This work is theoretical, carried out in close collaboration with laboratory experiments. <br/><br/>The research contributes to the knowledge base of quantum information science, and to the training of future scientists in this highly interdisciplinary field. Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results. The project is an integral part of the NSF-funded Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC). We use video conferencing to allow participation of CQuIC partners in the regular activities of CQuIC, including weekly group meetings and research seminars, and strengthen the connections between junior and senior members through an annual research retreat. All students and senior personnel actively participate in the Southwest Quantum Information Technology (SQuInT) network, including the annual workshop.

0.06,"This project will concern the investigation of reactions of slow electrons with biomolecules. Such slow electrons are typically found in human tissue after irradiation with deep ultra-violet photons and X-rays. The processes concerned will be in the excitation of electron states in the biomolecule, a process which is complicated by the size of such molecules, and involves close collaboration between two established and advanced theoretical (Caltech) and experimental (Cal State Fullerton) groups. Recent success in work with water has provided impetus for this collaboration to look at more complex molecules - methanol and ethanol and has provided a good foundation for this direction of research.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this collaboration is its involvement of international experimental (U. Juiz de Fora) and theoretical groups (USP, U. Parana in Curitiba, Unicamp) in Brazil. It also provides involvement of US undergraduate students at Cal State Fullerton to go to Brazil to carry out summer research to do experimental work in developing projects there as well as taking electron-biomolecule collisions data to transfer US technology to Brazil and to foster scientific relations between the two countries. This also provides impetus for Brazilian faculty and students from these universities to come to the USA to CIT/CSUF and collaborate.

0.27,"Intellectual Merit: This project focuses on understanding theoretically the interaction of intense coherent laser radiation with electrons, atoms, and molecules and on investigating the use of ultrashort (attosecond scale) laser or electron pulses to image the time-dependent motion of electrons in atoms and molecules. The interactions of electrons with both intense laser fields and with atomic and molecular potentials are difficult to describe accurately; also, their interactions with ultrashort laser or electron pulses must be described time-dependently. We have developed a number of theoretical approaches to overcome these difficulties. In particular, we have solved essentially exactly the problem of a weakly bound electron in a short-range potential interacting with an intense laser field and the results obtained for this particular system can be accurately generalized to the case of other, more complex atomic and molecular systems. Our investigations include: (1) using short (attosecond scale) electron pulses as both temporal and spatial probes of electron motion in both atoms and molecules; (2) investigating the utility of using intense lasers to assist or induce electron scattering from atoms, electron recombination with atoms, and electron bremsstrahlung (radiative) processes in the vicinity of atoms; (3) developing analytic formulas for laser-induced high-order harmonic generation for the heretofore analytically unexplored cases of elliptically-polarized laser fields, crossed two-color laser fields, and chirped, few-cycle laser fields, both for atoms and for asymmetric diatomic molecules. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved with this project are given a broad education in theoretical atomic physics, first hand experience in all aspects of scientific communication, and in teaching undergraduates at a large Big 10 Land Grant university.

Our work on increasing the intensities of high order harmonics may one day lead to sources of coherent x-rays, thus providing a new means for visualizing living biological structures as well as nanoscale material structures. Our investigations involving ultrashort (attosecond) pulses of electrons may lead to ways of resolving electron motion both temporally and spatially. The P.I.'s membership on the American Physical Society's Publications Oversight Committee (2010-2013) and on the Science Advisory Board of the Max Planck Institute on the Physics of Complex Systems (2007-2013), a major theoretical atomic physics center in Dresden, Germany, is evidence of his continuing service to the scientific community."

0.07,"This research program deals with the basic interactions of light and matter, studying entanglement and how entangled states evolve in time. Entanglement refers to the situation in which widely separated particles cannot be described independently of each other (or, mathematically, when the whole is not equal to the sum of its parts). An important direction for the research is to use mathematical models to explore these entangled states. This may have important applications, for example in managing the security of communication channels and in quantum information science.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop a complete catalog of correlation relations among a large number N of fundamental physical systems (spins, atoms, photons). This will be done by the technical process of bi-separation of quantum states. We have used both analytic and computer-based mathematical procedures to carry out, but have not yet published, a preliminary exploration of pure state bi-separations. These lead to constraints on occupation of what can be called entanglement-shared quantum state space. These constraints have a geometrical interpretation via simplexes and polytopes in N dimensions. The consequent description of N-party additivity leads to entanglement sharing relations and they substantially extend in a new direction the concurrence-based results called quantum monogamy. In the important but still simple case of 3 entangled parties, there are three bi-separations: a|bc, b|ac, and c|ab, and the consequent polytope in this case is a pair of base-to-base tetrahedrons inside a unit cube. Cross sections of the polytope transverse to the body diagonal of the cube are triangles, and we have found that their areas serve to quantify the amount of entanglement sharing that is possible among the three parties a,b,c. Exchanges with the fields of quantum information and quantum optics appear desirable and feasible, for example in developing protocols for multi-mode entanglement swapping at the macroscopic level."
0.2,"Correlations among photons are typically very weak: because photons do not interact with each other, the position of one photon does not depend on the position of another photon. However, if 'matter' is present with which the photons strongly interact, the matter mediates an effective interaction between the photons-- the first photon strongly affects the matter which then affects the second photon-- that then leads to photon-photon correlation. The matter can take a wide variety of forms, such as atoms, quantum dots, or superconducting qubits. Interactions in one dimension (1D) are particularly interesting since the photons cannot miss each other which often leads to enhanced correlations. Interest in these quantum optics phenomena in one dimension, dubbed 'waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)', or ""waveguide QED"",, has rapidly grown in recent years, driven notably by the fact that several such experimental systems can now be made with relatively strong interactions. Examples include tapered fibers coupled to atoms, microwave transmission lines coupled to superconducting qubits, and semiconductor dielectric waveguides coupled to quantum dots. Photon correlations in multi-qubit waveguide systems will be studied. Theoretically much is now known about a single atom or qubit interacting with 1D photons, and so the time is ripe for considering photonic waveguide systems with more complex matter. First, situations in which a few two-level-systems (qubits or atoms, say) interact with 1D light will be studied with the aim of describing the specifically quantum properties of the light that can be produced (non-classical light). Then, the case of many qubits (a large amount of matter) will be considered with the idea that new phases of the light/matter system may be possible. Phase transitions in driven systems, called dynamical phase transitions, are receiving increasing attention; the waveguide QED system may be a way to realize different kinds of dynamical phases. The research in this project connects to several other broad fields. First, nanophotonic devices often involve two-level systems and 1D modes as building blocks. The new physical effects studied here will lead to a better understanding of such elements and may lead to qualitatively new devices. Second, the proposed structures in their superconducting qubit/microwave version constitute quantum meta-materials, a rapidly developing offshoot of the enormous interest in meta-materials generally in recent years. Third, quantum networks for quantum information purposes involve elements that look exactly like the waveguide QED systems studied here. <br/><br/>The subject of this research is the correlations among photons in a waveguide caused by their interaction with discrete quantum objects, such as atoms, quantum dots, or qubits. Photon correlations caused by strong light-matter interaction have been studied extensively in the context of relatively closed cavities. In contrast, one-dimensional (1D) waveguides are quantum open systems, in some of which, nevertheless, it may soon be possible to achieve strong coupling to atoms or qubits. In this theoretical work photon correlations in multi-qubit waveguide systems will be investigated. Specifically, three areas will be studied. First, nonclassical light and time delay for few qubit systems will be studied. The photon correlations (coherences) will be calculated for several few qubit situations involving up to 10 two-level or three-level systems. An immediate result will be the change in the properties of the non-classical light generated as a function of number of qubits - non-classical features are expected to be enhanced, though the interplay with interference effects may be complicated. Three-level systems introduce a new aspect: time-delay. The use of this for enhancing interaction or interference effects (interferometry) will be evaluated. Second, for many qubit systems, the question of whether dynamical phase transitions can produce new states of light will be studied. An infinite system with sparse periodic, disordered, or dense atoms or qubits brings in the possibility of a new state of light. Since the system is necessarily driven, this would involve a dynamical phase transition. Whether such a transition can take place in a waveguide QED system will be evaluated. Finally, quantum optics phenomena with DC electrical transport will be studied. Electromagnetic radiation along a chain of Josephson junctions coupled to a superconducting qubit is a new waveguide QED system. If time permits, the possibility of probing the system by electrical transport through a weakly coupled probe junction, thus revealing the quantum optics properties, will be investigated. Several methods will be used to tackle these problems. Tasks 1 and 3 can be started with exact methods that were developed previously, and then will be continued with numerical propagation of pulses. Both the few and many qubit problems will be approached with a slave-boson mean field theory and Keldysh quantum field theory. The comparison with the exact methods in the few qubit cases will provide an important cross-check."
0.18,"Laser-driven collisions of electrons and atoms--so-called ""recollisions""-- are a key process in ultrastrong lasers. Understanding their role in various laser field configurations is potentially very rewarding for tracking the motion of giant molecules by taking their snapshots in real time. A mechanism which accounts for the rich physics in these strong laser fields is urgently needed. In particular, the impact of recolliding electrons ""hitching rides"" on special orbits on their way to and from the atom will be researched using mechanical models. <br/><br/>Mechanical treatments of atoms are the perfect physics education and training tool because they allow many atomic properties to be understood pictorially and with comparatively little effort. In addition to graduate student training, undergraduate research projects on classical dynamics will be a component of this research program, as will advising mathematics and science teachers at high schools and technical colleges on pedagogical aspects of atoms. This research is often viewed as a valuable source for applications by mathematicians, and a source of new insights by chemists and therefore serves to strengthen the research infrastructure."
0.185,"Tunneling through a potential barrier is one of the most basic and extraordinary features of quantum mechanics. It plays a key role in important technologies such as tunneling diodes and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), both used in common devices ranging from electronics to biological measurements. Atomic, molecular, and optical theory has a long history of exploring fundamental questions in physics in tabletop experiments, from limits on the standard model of particle physics in studies of basic symmetries of the universe to time variation of fundamental physical constants in cold molecules. We will push the limits of quantum mechanics and disparate notions of what is macroscopic, in practical realizations in ultracold quantum gases. We focus on macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT), i.e., tunneling of many particles at once, where very many outstanding problems remain unanswered. Bose-Einstein condensates and ultracold quantum gases provide an ideal context in which to explore MQT because they are highly tunable and controllable macroscopic quantum systems in which theoretical ideas can be realized directly in present experiments.<br/><br/>We have a multi-faceted approach to meet broader impact goals. First, we will continue to organize national and international workshops and conferences including the recent cold molecules program in Spring 2013. Second, we will work with large numbers of undergraduate researchers via the Colorado School of Mines' (CSM) senior design / senior thesis program, CSM's combined BS/MS programs, and the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program. Third, we will continue to foster an accepting, diverse environment within our research group to support underrepresented groups in physics. Finally, the training of students in rigorous numerical techniques and high-performance parallel computing is key to success in a number of arenas in society, from the space program to global climate change. We will train such students, and support a PI involved in that effort from the undergraduate through post-doctoral levels."
0.3,"This research project addresses mechanisms underlying the strong interaction of subatomic physics in terms of the confined quarks and gluons described by that part of the Standard Model known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We implement a continuum nonperturbative approach based on the Dyson-Schwinger equations of QCD which preserves the short distance renormalization group behavior of perturbative QCD while the infrared domain is described by one parameter to generate the empirical amount of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. The latter phenomenon is the source for the generation of at least 98% of the mass of known stable matter in the universe, and it guides the development of our theoretical methods.<br/><br/>This work will analyze and interpret information about the quark and gluon structure of sub-atomic particles produced by the Jefferson Laboratory at Newport News Virginia (JLab), and provide predictions for the experiments anticipated from the upgrade currently being undertaken. Theoretical work of this type informs and motivates a portfolio of fundamental physics programs at sub-atomic physics laboratories across the world. Specific physics issues addressed include parton distributions of the pion and kaon mesons, the transition or generalized parton distributions of the pion and kaon mesons, the elastic and transition form factors of pions for a complete range of momentum transfer, and an extension to nucleon parton distributions, and their ratios. We anticipate a by-product will be a new understanding of the mass scale for transition from non-perturbative to perturbative dynamics in the pion charge form factor. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of the program include the cross-fertilization of nuclear and particle physics, a return on the investment in the experimental facilities at JLab and RHIC, and integration of research and education through the research training of graduate students in connection with undergraduate teaching. The interactions of graduate students with scientists who are prominent nationally and internationally is a contribution to the nation's infrastructure for research and education. The PI uses examples from this research program to illustrate key elements of core graduate classes in Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear and Particle Physics. The PI supervises an informal seminar course for graduate students and postdoctoral associates to discuss and present aspects of QCD and field theory that underly this research program. The collaboration with overseas colleagues will enhance international cooperation in science research and education."
0.42,"In this project, the PIs will use single-molecule optical tweezers to elucidate the structural, mechanical and thermodynamic consequences of biologically-relevant post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the behavior of individual nucleosomes and on chromatin condensation. The fundamental biological significance of the proposed research is that the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes and chromatin, and its modulation by histone modifications and histone H1, are essential aspects of gene regulation in all eukaryotes. Specific objectives of this project include: (1) assemble nucleosomes and chromatin, using histone H4 with prescribed single and multiple site-specific acetylation; (2) compare the behavior of chromatin in the presence of magnesium ions or magnesium ions and linker histone H1, which are key factors regulating condensation, to the behavior of chromatin without these factors; (3) determine accurate free energy differences between the different molecular states encountered, using an intelligent force-stepping protocol; (4) compare the behavior of nucleosomes containing histone H4 with acetylated tails to those containing H4 with mutated tails, that mimic acetylation, revealing the role of charge. Thus, this project will provide observations and measurements needed to create and validate physical models of eukaryotic gene expression. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include: (1) these studies have potential human health benefits, because several diseases, including asthma and a number of cancers, are linked to histone PTMs; (2) by following Yale's Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology (IGPPEB) and serving as teaching fellows in a novel introductory physics sequence, that seeks to engage life-science undergraduates, the graduate students involved in this project will join a new generation of researcher/teachers, who excel at quantitative approaches, have the biological sophistication to identify and apply their skills to cutting-edge biological problems, and are excited to educate future generations; (3) to encourage an interest in science in the next generation, the PIs will work with Breakthrough New Haven, a high school preparation program for socio-economically disadvantaged students in Grades 7 and 8, to implement hands-on science modules for Breakthrough's summer program, and will host high-school students for summer research projects in their laboratories.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.5,"In this project the PI will combine the tracking and imaging technologies to understand what flagella do as cells run and tumble. Using current technology the PI will be able to track cells, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, that move even faster than E. coli, which, if grown on a rich medium, swims nearly 40 diameters per second. One of the goals of the project is to compare the run-tumble behavior of cells with different numbers of flagella. Another goal is to study mutants in which the concentration of the response regulator CheY-P is constant. The latter experiments can confirm or rule out the possibility that flagellar coordination is driven by fluctuations in the concentration of the response regulator CheY-P, fluctuations known to occur in wild-type cells. In addition the PI will visualize single filaments in flagellar bundles. Bacterial motility is profoundly important for human health, where it helps promote infections, including those complicated by biofilm formation. Bacterial chemotaxis is the best understood behavioral system in biology, with the understanding of chemoreception, signal transduction, and motor output sufficiently complete to inspire productive mathematical modeling. The PI will establish a facility where the behavior of any organism can be characterized and students will participate. The PI will utilize the talents of physics undergraduates, both for programming and for tracking, which will introduce them to this exciting interdisciplinary field."
0.422821,"The present CAREER award integrates research and educational components focused on the understanding of nuclear properties and their application to the interdisciplinary field of nuclear astrophysics. The main focus of the research is to address the question: How were the heavy elements made? The research component aims at the study of the decay properties of exotic nuclei utilizing the technique of Total Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS). Measurements will focus on nuclei along the rapid-neutron-capture process (or r-process), which is believed to be responsible for the origin of half of the heavy elements. The measurements will build on the previous experience of the PI in the development and use of a Total Absorption Spectrometer and will utilize existing equipment at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory together with the implementation of new proposed equipment, in this case a tape transport system for the removal of background activity from the detection area.<br/><br/>The technical focus of the research is through the measurement of beta-decay strength distributions of nuclei along the astrophysical r-process. The beta-decay strength distribution is the only reliable parameter for constraining the theoretical models used in r-process calculations and improving their predictive power. <br/><br/>The PI will also establish a unique, new one-week summer school for rising juniors in the area of nuclear physics. The school will be available to 12 students each summer and provide hands-on laboratory activities as well as instruction in nuclear physics. Students from schools that do not offer an undergraduate course in nuclear physics will benefit from this summer school. Ultimately it is important to increase the number of graduate students in the field of low-energy nuclear structure physics, which is important not only for the basic science addressed, but as a training ground for skilled workers in critical areas of homeland security."
0.244965,"An international REU site, Modern Optics in the City of Light, will bring eight undergraduates to Paris each summer to conduct research, collaboratively, with faculty at the University of Michigan's Center for Ultrafast Optical Sciences (CUOS) and several Parisian research institutions; Ecole Polytechnique, Ecole Nationale de Techniques Avancées (ENSTA), the Institut d'Optique Graduate School, Université Paris-Sud 11, and Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan. The students will be put into research teams that include the student, a faculty member at UM and a faculty member in one of the Parisian institutions. The students will spend one week in Ann Arbor, followed by nine weeks in Paris. Each student will keep weekly on-line research diaries to aid in communication with each full group. A CUOS faculty member or research scientist will accompany the students to Paris and stay for one week to ensure that the students get a good start. The students will be housed in a local hotel in Ann Arbor and at the Cité Universitaire in Paris.<br/><br/>The research that will be conducted will include both on-going collaborative projects between CUOS and the French institutions and new collaborative projects. The research in all projects will all involve the use of ultrafast lasers to discover very current, state-of-the art phenomena in a wide range of fields including; relativistic optics, plasma physics, materials spectroscopy, nano-machining, patterned biological cell templating, high power fiber lasers, plasma x-ray sources, dynamics of nano-magnetic materials, terahertz imaging, biomedical imaging with shaped pulses, fatigue life studies of materials, as well as other topics."
0.091722,"The ability to learn relational data is critical to human life as we know it. By learning the relationships between syllables and words, or scientific and mathematical concepts, we produce language, form lexical knowledge, develop physical intuition, exercise logical deduction, and attain expertise in our line of work. Collectively, these relational data can be described as a graph in which nodes might represent syllables or concepts, and edges might represent shared content or conditional probabilities. Yet, how the organization of such a graph impacts our ability to learn the data or the neural processes that affect learning is far from understood. In this project the PI will use network science as a mathematical framework within which she will study the human learning of relational patterns, and answer the question of whether graphs that are complex in the mathematical or naturalistic senses are more or less difficult to learn, or require different neural processes. To facilitate broader impacts, these efforts incorporate art to transform STEM to STEAM, a recent international innovation that improves long-term retention of content and scientific reasoning. The goals of this program are (i) to create a local community - from preschoolers to adults - who are generally inspired by cutting edge science, and who more specifically appreciate the concepts of network architectures in natural information and in their brain?s ability to learn that information, (ii) to produce undergraduate and graduate students trained at the interdisciplinary boundary between network science and neuroscience to address critical and timely scientific questions that transcend national boundaries, (iii) to develop course material that incorporates these timely research questions, and (iv) to polish and release teaching materials developed in these aims to international and global collaborators, and to the public. The PI complements these efforts with extensive mentorship for women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields, and with educational outreach efforts in under-served inner-city Philadelphia schools.<br/><br/>In particular the PI will use a 3-pronged approach that employs (i) engineering-based tools from network science to systematically define graph ensembles of relational information with dissociable topologies, (ii) behavioral studies to determine which graph topologies are easier or harder to learn, and (iii) functional neuroimaging to identify predictors of individual differences in learning. Exploratory work seeks to translate the knowledge gained in these areas to instructed learning of scientific concepts. In this proposal, the PI brings together her background in theoretical physics and network science, her expertise in multimodal human neuroimaging, her current research program intersecting engineering and cognitive neuroscience, and her recently developed methods to predict individual differences in learning from the dynamics of human brain functional connectivity to determine how the graph topology of relational information maps to individual differences in human learning behavior as produced by dissociable neurophysiological processes."
0.44323,"The goal of this program is to study materials at a fundamental level. The result is a deeper understanding of important materials, and new insights into the principles of material properties. By creating and studying models of new materials, the researchers want to find out if speculative new materials can be realized in Nature. The experimental program employs methods developed in atomic physics to control the motion and orientation of atoms with unprecedented precision. Those well controlled building blocks can now be assembled into new materials like Lego pieces. These new materials may show behavior similar to naturally occurring materials which are not fully understood, or even display phenomena never seen before. Assembling new forms of matter with well separated atoms has the advantage that the building blocks and their interactions are well known, and therefore also the basic equations describing their behavior. This together leads to a platform where both theoretical methods (analyzing these equations) and experimental methods (using the precision of atomic physics) can be combined to obtain a deeper understanding for important materials and find new possibilities for synthesizing new materials. The major focus of the research program is on the question how strong magnetic fields and magnetic couplings (called spin-orbit coupling) change the properties of electrons in semiconductors and metals. Since our Lego pieces are neutral atoms, real magnetic fields are replaced by so-called synthetic magnetic fields created with the help of laser beams. In addition, the researchers will study fundamental aspects of ferromagnetism, and create ultracold molecules. The realization of new forms of ultracold matter will advance our understanding of materials and provide guiding principles for materials research. The proposed work is fundamental in its immediate impact, but in the long run, it should lead to devices and advanced materials with yet unknown properties, and open new possibilities and applications. Besides promoting the progress of science; this program educates students and postdocs and prepares them for a career in areas of advanced technology.<br/><br/>More technically, the goal of this project is to further advance the use of cold atoms as model systems for strongly correlated matter, but also to take this approach to the next level by creating materials with no known counterpart in Nature. In the spirit of quantum simulations, samples will be prepared which are the simplest possible realizations of many-body Hamiltonians representing idealized paradigmatic forms of matter. The major foci of the proposed research in the next five years are the themes of synthetic gauge fields and spin orbit coupling. These goals make strong connections with current frontiers in many-body theory and in condensed matter physics, including the quantum Hall effect, topological insulators, and strongly correlated states. These materials are more profoundly quantum mechanical than ordinary materials because they exploit non-trivial quantum mechanical phases (geometric phases, Berry phase) or quantum entanglement. In addition,it is planned to explore itinerant ferromagnetism, cooling to picokelvin temperatures using adiabatic state preparation, and the sodium-lithium dimer as a heteronuclear dipolar molecule."
12.15,"Understanding and controlling the quantum world are among the great challenges of physical science. Meeting these challenges can open the way to the design of new forms of matter and possibly new paths to information processing. In this quest, strongly interacting systems present both the current greatest scientific challenges and also the highest potential rewards. Ultracold atoms provide a new medium for pursuing this quest because they can be controlled and manipulated with a precision never previously possible, and observed with a clarity that can be breathtaking. The intellectual merit of this work is the quest to discover how natural and artificial materials work, to understand complex quantum systems, and to explore the basic physics and potential applications of engineered quantum systems. As of now, the nature of many strongly correlated systems, their dynamical behavior, and the fundamental and practical limits of quantum control over complex quantum systems are not well understood. Furthermore, only very few practical applications of controlled quantum systems are known, despite the great promise they hold. The work of the Center will attempt to uncover these mysteries. This may lead to the creation of new quantum phases of matter, to a better understanding and greatly improved control over many-body quantum systems, and to new applications of such systems.<br/><br/>Motivated by these considerations, the Center for Ultracold Atoms carries out research guided by the two themes of: Many-body systems and strongly correlated states; and Quantum coherent control of few-body systems. These scientific themes are complementary. In particular, within the first theme, strongly correlated systems can be realized by engineering the interactions and motion of large clouds of dilute ultracold gases. This kind of top-down approach to quantum systems is matched in the CUA with the second theme, where a bottom-up approach uses coherent quantum control of individual particles; controllable sets of quanta can be connected to build up increasingly more complex quantum systems. In what is now the third phase of the CUA, we retain focus on these two key scientific themes, but with a major addition to our spectrum of research to include new atom-like and hybrid quantum systems. Specifically, we use and study atom-like solid-state impurities, nanoscale photonic and plasmonic cavities and waveguides, as well as superconducting and nano-mechanical resonators in order to obtain quantum control and manipulation at a new, previously inaccessible level. These systems share with cold atoms the property that they can be precisely prepared and manipulated using the concepts and tools of atomic physics. Our key motivation for adding these new approaches is to extend the AMO techniques for precise quantum state control to completely new parameter regimes not accessible with ""real"" atoms. At the same time we will use these systems to explore new scientific directions and potential applications.<br/><br/>Within theme 1, the area of many-body systems, projects include microscopic control and probing of strongly correlated states using a quantum microscope or single atom impurities, the study of many-body dynamics far away from equilibrium, and the realization of new systems with strong correlations, in particular the study of quantum magnetism and spin-lattice systems simulated using polar molecules. Within theme 2, the area of few-body systems, we continue our work on quantum state control of strongly coupled atom-photon systems, as well as add a major extension to the CUA by shifting focus towards atom-like and quantum hybrid systems. Recent pioneering work (with major contributions from the CUA) has shown that the precise methods of cold atom science can now be applied to certain solid-state quantum systems. This allows for the creation of long-lived coherent superposition states and the generation of quantum entanglements at previously inaccessible length and energy scales (e.g. between those of dilute atomic gases and solid matter). In addition, novel strongly interacting AMO systems such as Rydberg atoms, polar molecules and ion crystals will be explored, sometimes as part of a hybrid system. These new systems offer avenues to access new parameter regimes and new approaches to device integration. A major new focus will be on hybrid systems, where disparate quantum platforms are coupled (e.g. solid-state spins and photons, molecules and superconductors, isolated atoms and nanoscale waveguides). Such avenues may result in major advances towards scalable quantum systems, and in the development of new classes of applications. In the course of this work a new scientific interface between AMO physics and nanoscience will be explored. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work span a wide range of areas, including materials science, metrology, sensing, communication and computation, chemical physics, biological science and energy research. Some possibilities include: The quantum simulation possible with lattice confined atoms or polar molecules could shed light on materials such as high-Tc superconductors, and eventually result in development of new materials with custom-designed properties. Work on quantum interfaces between light and matter may allow us to develop practical systems for long-distance quantum communication and cryptography. Robust generation of correlated atomic states, such as spin-squeezed states in systems compatible with optical clock transitions, can potentially extend clock performance to unprecedented levels. Quantum controlled atom-like and hybrid systems such as NV centers in diamond may yield unique probes for magnetic fields in biological systems at the nanoscale. Work on quantum nonlinear optics at low light levels could result in new approaches for energy-efficient all-optical switching and computation. Understanding and control of light-matter interaction at nanoscales could eventually result in novel approaches for energy harvesting and conversion.<br/><br/>As well as being a research center, the CUA will continue its focus on education and outreach, using both existing and new efforts. A full spectrum of well-supported activities will continue to make an impact at the K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels (both inside and outside the CUA core institutions), as well as the broader research community and the public. Examples of successful continuing activities include the TOPS program for future high school teachers and the intensive summer course in atomic physics (open to students and other researchers worldwide). An example of a new activity we begin in phase 3 is the production of explanatory videos that describe CUA research, aimed at students and the public. We are also initiating programs to bring to the CUA, for summer research, interested undergraduates from minority serving institutions and programs to expose high-school students to CUA research. A hallmark of the CUA has been the flexible addition of new outreach and education programs as they are conceived, and we will continue this tradition. A major impact of the CUA is through its education of graduate students and postdocs. A large number of young CUA researchers have advanced to leadership positions in academia and industry. Through sponsorship of workshops, the biannual Atomic Physics summer school, the Virtual Journal of Atomic Quantum Gases, and its visitors program, the CUA shares its vision and expertise with the scientific community."
0.218,"Plasma - the fourth state of matter - is of abundant presence in the universe. Plasmas are used by mankind in a broad variety of industrial and scientific applications, from material processing for food packaging, medical applications, and the car industry to next generation particle accelerators and new space propulsion systems. Even in spite of the broad importance of plasma for scientific and<br/>socio-economical aspects, it is the least addressed physical science topic from K-12 education up to college level. The central goal of this CAREER award project of the National Science Foundation is combining a cutting edge plasma physics research mission with a rigorous outreach activity to make plasma physics more visible to the general public as an important field of physical sciences for the development and progress of modern industrial societies.<br/><br/>The central research endeavor of this award project is the generation and understanding of high density plasma regimes using highly efficient plasma sources - in this case helicon waves. Active gas fueling will be explored as a method to overcome the empirical density limit found for such plasma configurations, and state-of-the-art methods of active laser spectroscopy will be employed to measure the dynamics of the neutral particles and of ionization. The Laboratory for Plasma Physics class in the Department of Engineering Physics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is employed as a central element for education and outreach. A teacher summer class will be developed in collaboration with the Madison Metropolitan School District as a fertilizing environment to foster implementation of basic plasma physics aspects as extensions to present high school curricula. This effort will be at the same time a central training activity for next generation faculty. Two graduate students are involved in the development and execution of this central outreach project, transforming the laboratory course into an advanced discovery learning experience on plasma physics."
0.519102,"Gravity, the most evident force of nature, is in fact the weakest of the fundamental forces, and consequently the most poorly tested. Einstein's general relativity, which is currently our best description of gravity, is fundamentally incompatible with quantum mechanics and is likely to be replaced by a more complete theory in the future. A modified theory would predict small deviations in the solar system that could have profound consequences for our understanding of the Universe as a whole. Lunar laser ranging (LLR), in which short laser pulses launched from a telescope are bounced off of reflectors placed on the moon by U.S. astronauts and Soviet landers, has for decades produced various leading tests of gravity by mapping the shape of the lunar orbit to high precision. The group proposes to continue conducting leading-edge observations with the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO), in an effort to subject gravity to the most stringent tests yet. APOLLO, situated atop a 9,200 ft summit in Southern New Mexico, introduces a new regime of millimeter-precision in measuring the lunar orbit. However, incomplete models are thus far unable to confirm the accuracy. The group will therefore seek to build a calibration system to ensure that APOLLO meets its millimeter measurement goal, in addition to continuing the observation campaign. The proposed work will benefit the broader community in a number of ways. On the intellectual front, improving our knowledge of gravity informs a diverse range of cosmologists, astrophysicists, particle physicists, and string theorists. The effort would also contribute to Earth and planetary science, especially via measurements produced by the superconducting gravimeter. The APOLLO team will continue a track record of engagement in education and outreach activities, and will no doubt continue to attract public interest through print, web, radio, and television media.<br/><br/>Among other attributes that contribute to APOLLO's superior observations, routine ranging to all five lunar reflectors on timescales of minutes dramatically improves our ability to gauge lunar orientation and body distortion. This information allows a more precise determination of the path for the Moon's center of mass, thereby facilitating tests of fundamental gravity. Simultaneously, higher precision range measurements, together with data from a superconducting gravimeter at the Apache Point Observatory and from a high-quality Global Positioning System (GPS) station 2.5 km away, will greatly improve our understanding of the instantaneous location of the Observatory with respect to the Earth's center of mass (needed for the gravitational tests) by exposing subtle Earth dynamics that must be incorporated into the model. LLR measurements provide the best available tests of the strong equivalence principle, the time-rate-of-change of Newton's gravitational constant, gravitomagnetism, the inverse-square law, and preferred frame effects. In addition to these classical gravitational tests, APOLLO will permit testing of new ideas in physics relating to dark energy, extra dimensions, and violations of Lorentz Invariance. A large part of the effort proposed here is the construction of an absolute calibration system based on a cesium clock standard, a low-jitter short-pulse laser, and a precision interval counter. This system will provide an independent check of APOLLO's fundamental measurement, potentially identifying faults and confirming their pursuant remediation."
0.336008,"Among the key areas of study currently in particle physics are precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters, the neutrino mass hierarchy and measurement of CP violation in the neutrino sector. To address these requires a more detailed understanding, both experimentally and theoretically, of neutrino interactions in nuclear matter. With the emphasis long baseline experiments, in which matter effects are important, and on Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers as the detectors of choice for many experiments, where the relevant atomic number is A=40 for Argon, such understanding is not only necessary, but fundamental.<br/><br/>The research effort at Virginia Polytechnic and State University is aimed directly at these questions and is based on a complementary approach using experiment, theory and simulation. The objectives include: (1) to compare event generator predictions with experimental data, focusing on comparisons with measurements that the Virginia Tech group and collaborators will perform in Liquid Argon using the MicroBooNE detector; (2) to determine the impact of nuclear models, correlations and neutrino interaction uncertainties on the discovery of CP violation in the lepton sector and the experimental determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters; (3) to include state-of-the-art nuclear models in the neutrino interaction simulation and (4) to determine the level of detail needed in these models to achieve the required sensitivity to observe CP violation. The proposed research is potentially transformative, by altering and refining the scope of the GENIE neutrino event generator to predict events more precisely and interface it with the GLoBES simulator to understand the effect of neutrino interactions on the determination of neutrino oscillation parameters for past and future neutrino experiments worldwide.<br/><br/>In parallel with the research, the program includes important educational components, directed at high school and more advanced levels. The group will build upon an already active PhysTec program at Virginia Tech and will create a QuarkNet center to attract high school teachers and students, with initial emphasis on neutrino physics. The group also actively encourages the participation in the research of students from underrepresented groups through the Virginia-North Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation (VT-AMP) program."
0.15,"Quantum mechanics tells us that both matter and light can exhibit wave-like or particle-like behavior. Devices that use the interference of waves--the fact that waves can cancel each other out or enhance each other--enable highly sensitive measurements of almost anything: time, gravity, motion, or electric and magnetic fields. In particular, atomic clocks, that are based on wave interference, are the most accurate devices ever made by mankind, and have many important technological applications. Clocks and other interferometers operate by measuring many independent atoms in parallel to enhance the signal. The device readout is then subject to measurement noise (projection noise), not unlike the flipping of a collection of coins where the outcome is not always an equal number of heads and tails. Here it is proposed to develop methods to produce correlated states of many atoms (so-called entangled states) that can be used to reduce or eliminate the projection noise. Quantum mechanics allows one to prepare a situation where each coin individually still randomly shows head or tail, but the collection of coins always shows an equal number of heads and tails. By demonstrating the generation of such states, the proposed research program could boost the precision of atomic clocks and other interferometers, with significant implications for timekeeping, navigation, and precision measurements. The proposed work will unite research and educational goals by training graduate students, and by integrating undergraduate students and exceptional high-school students into the research effort. <br/><br/>This project is aimed at the deterministic preparation of non-classical (many-body entangled) states of atomic ensembles and of light fields using collective atom-light interaction enhanced by an optical resonator. Such states can be used to improve the precision of atomic clocks and other atom interferometers beyond the standard quantum limit. The main goals of the project are to demonstrate a non-destructive measurement of the power of a traveling laser beam below the photon shot noise limit, to create Schroedinger cat states or strongly spin squeezed states of a large atomic ensemble via the detection of a single photon, and to use such states to operate an atomic clock below the standard quantum."

0.45,"Entangled states of atomic ensembles have the potential to overcome various limits in quantum measurements, including the so-called standard quantum limit associated with measurements on a collection of independent particles. To realize entanglement in a many-body system, internal states of cold, trapped atoms that are strongly coupled to laser light inside an optical resonator will be used. The photons inside the cavity act as messengers between distant atoms, and can be used to induce effective state-dependent long-range atom-atom interactions. These interactions, in turn, can be utilized to redistribute quantum noise so as to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of atomic clocks and atom interferometers (""spin squeezing""). In this project we implement a modified spin squeezing method that allows one to disentangle the outgoing light from the atoms while maintaining the light-mediated atom-atom interaction. This new method provides not only much stronger spin squeezing than previously possible, it also enables the generation of non-Gaussian entangled states and even Schroedinger cat states in mesoscopic atomic ensembles. Furthermore, using the strong interaction between an atom and a mode of the optical resonator, we hope to demonstrate a variety of novel quantum optical devices, including a single-photon all-optical switch, a dispersive photon-number-state filter, and a deterministic quantum gate between two photons.<br/><br/>A major frontier of physics is the control of quantum mechanical many-body systems. Such control will enable novel devices for storing and processing quantum information, improve fundamental precision measurements, and enhance and deepen our understanding of key concepts of many-body quantum physics. Of particular interest is the quantum control of precision systems such as atomic clocks. Atomic clocks are the most accurate devices ever made by mankind, and have many important technological applications, including the Global Positioning System and telecommunication networks. This research program could significantly improve the precision of optical-transition atomic clocks beyond current limits, and enable many new technologies linked to the ability to precisely keep time. The project will train graduate students and undergraduate students. Exceptional high-school students will be integrated into the research effort. Efforts are made to include underrepresented minority students."

This award will support research that will yield new insights in the diffuse astrophysical electron and tau neutrino energy spectrum and its characteristics delineated by hemisphere. Anisotropy, if it is found, will provide evidence for a galactic and an extragalactic origin of the recently discovered astrophysical neutrinos. The energy spectrum will confirm or refute the characteristics predicted by theoretical models on the possible sources of the high-energy diffuse neutrino flux and may also probe non-'Standard Model' physics.<br/><br/>By integrating forefront research with education and outreach, the PI seeks to broaden the career prospects for SBU physics students and to expand and diversify the pool of students in STEM fields.

0.15,"Twenty-three pairs of human chromosomes contain two meters of DNA. These long DNA molecules are folded inside a nucleus of a human cell that is about 5 microns in diameter. Chromosomes are not only carriers of our genetic information, but are also fascinating polymer systems with an organization that allows rapid packing and unpacking during the cell cycle and easy access to genetic information for reading and copying. This study will elucidate the physical principles that govern chromosome organization, an emerging frontier in the Physics of Living Systems. The investigators will focus on the development of polymer models of human chromosomes and use these models to elucidate principles of genome organization in 3 dimensions during interphase. Recently developed experimental techniques provide a wealth of information about chromosomal interactions and reveal multiple levels of chromosome organization, each with its unique physical characteristics: at large scales, chromosomes are organized into alternating active and inactive chromatin compartments; at smaller scales these are partitioned into subdomains. Little is know about possible physical mechanisms that drive such organization at each level and how the different levels are connected. Available data provide an excellent resource for developing and testing physical models of chromosome organization, allowing us to address a fundamental question: how is DNA folded inside human chromosomes? Activities for freshmen and high school students include (1) involving high-school students in cutting-edge research in our group through the highly successful MIT PRIMES; (2) involving MIT undergraduate students in our proposed research through the MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program; (3) development of a new Freshmen Seminar in Quantitative Biology, aimed at training the next generation of MIT students with an appreciation and understanding of the role of physics in living systems.<br/><br/>The PI will address many important and unexplored problems in Polymer Physics, such as the nature of non-equilibrium states that emerge upon decondensation, the role of topological constraints, and the effect of heteropolymeric interactions in formation of multiscale structures. The four specific aims of the project are (1) develop a non-equilibrium model of the polymer ensemble that characterizes a whole chromosome after decondensation from mitosis; (2) identify physical mechanisms and heteropolymeric interactions that can give rise to organization of human chromosomes into large (1-5Mb) compartments; (3) develop models of domain organization at a smaller (0.2-1Mb) level, and to elucidate heteropolymer characteristics that can underlie such organization; (4) develop a multiscale model that integrates these three levels of organization and can explain several features and characteristics of the Hi-C and microscopy data."
0.776024,"In this project the PI will develop a neuromechanics of locomotion on dry and wet granular substrates. This will be used to address how effective movement results from the interaction of body morphology and posture, muscles, Central Pattern Generators (CPG), and sensory systems with the physical features of complex environments like solidification and fluidization. The PI will study three organisms -- sandfish lizards, zebratailed lizards, and salamanders -- that respectively swim, walk and run effectively within and on granular substrates. These organisms will be chosen as representatives of effective locomotion in a given substrate: the sandfish swimming in sand, the zebra-tailed lizard sprinting over a diversity of granular terrain, the salamander walking in mud. The salamander also embodies features thought to be representative of early tetrapods. The project will use high speed imaging (both visible light and x-ray), granular force platforms, and electromyography (EMG) to record kinematics, dynamics, and muscle activity. The PI will develop controlled granular substrates using fluidized beds which will allow both creation of repeatable initial conditions and rapid perturbations to generate neuromechanical control hypotheses. Robotic models of organisms to test hypotheses will be built as well. The models will have relevance to organisms in the present and will be a step toward development of quantitative hypotheses of the evolution of movement on land. Understanding of the physics of soft materials like mud and wet sand will be enhanced. The work also has clear implications for robotics; in the modern world, in which disasters are common and affect many lives, there is a pressing need for devices that can explore complex shifting terrain. The PI will use the robots from the locomotion research to create hands-on robot modules to teach science by: 1) Developing and teaching a course in hands-on experimental science for undergraduates emphasizing principles of mechanics, electronics and biology. 2) Bringing K-12 teachers to Georgia Tech in the summer to learn to use hands-on locomoting robot kits. 3) Developing ""Robotics Inspired Science Education"" (RISE) nights to utilize robots to generate interest and teach principles of science to the public."
9,"The LIGO Data Grid (LDG) is a distributed computational facility that hosts the middleware and support personnel needed to turn a collection of computer clusters into a powerful data analysis engine for gravitational wave science. Development, deployment and support of the LDG was provided by the NSF award ""Enabling gravitational-wave astronomy on the LIGO Data Grid"" [PHY-0600953]. This award provides continuing support for the skilled personnel who will continue to support and maintain the LDG and deliver the substantial improvements in services, scalability and reliability needed by Advanced LIGO. The primary goals of this proposal are: to allow the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) to complete the analysis of Initial LIGO observations; to deliver the software infrastructure and LDG services to support gravitational-wave astronomy with Advanced LIGO and its international partners; to provide the cyber-infrastructure needed to bring gravitational-wave astronomy together with the broader astronomical community; and to prototype tools for open access to LIGO data for the scientific community and the public.<br/><br/>Gravitational waves and black holes are among the most dramatic predictions of Einstein's General theory of Relativity. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is an ambitious NSF-funded project designed to directly detect gravitational waves and to use these waves to explore the universe. LIGO forms part of a world-wide network of gravitational-wave observatories poised to probe black holes, neutron stars, supernovae and the early universe using gravitational-waves as a new astronomical tool. The Advanced LIGO detectors are currently under construction and will begin their first observations in approximately 2015. The first direct detection of gravitational waves will be a watershed event in 21st century physics and astronomy. The scientific goals of the LSC rely on a substantial computational infrastructure, which spans astrophysical data analysis, detector and analysis middleware, software sustainability and computational hardware support. Initial LIGO has shown that cyber-infrastructure is as essential to gravitational-wave astronomy as the detectors themselves. It will not be possible to detect gravitational-wave sources, to study their properties, and to maximize the NSF's investment in LIGO without support for the enabling computational technologies. This award to develop and sustain Advanced LIGO's cyber-infrastructure will allow the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to be ready for the transformative new science that gravitational-wave observations will bring. The LDG research program will train students and postdocs to be experts in next-generation cyber-infrastructure, push the boundaries of LIGO's geographically distributed, locally-available computational data grid, and sustain the operation of this cyber-infrastructure to support LIGO's science mission. Collaborations with external partners (including Internet2, Globus, Condor and Pegasus) will have significant impact outside the LSC."

0.15,"A good portion of this award is devoted to the study of the formation of singularities, both in solutions of Einstein's equations and in solutions of Ricci flow. For Einstein's equations, one of the key issues is Strong Cosmic Censorship (""SCC""): Is it true that the ubiquitous geodesic incompleteness predicted by the Hawking-Penrose theorems generically involve spacetime curvature (and therefore gravitational tidal) blowup? At least in certain families of spacetimes defined by isometries, the determination that the solutions exhibit ""AVTD"" behavior (dominance of time derivatives of the fields over space derivatives near the singularity) is a very helpful tool for studying SCC, and is interesting in its own right. Some of our work involves the development of a framework for proving that there are large sets of smooth (non-analytic) solutions in these families which show AVTD behavior. Our studies of singularities in Ricci flow have focused on those known as ""neckpinches"". We have, in particular, shown that there is a discretely parametrized family of Ricci flow solutions which develop ""degenerate neckpinches"", with the geometry asymptotically approaching a ""Bryant soliton"" at a prescribed rate (consistent with Type 2 behavior). These solutions are all rotationally symmetric. Wanting to know if the detailed asymptotic behavior seen in these solutions is also characteristic of non-rotationally symmetric solutions, we have chosen to first address this issue in the case of mean curvature flow (""MCF""), since MCF neckpinches share many features with those of Ricci flow, and since it is easier with MCF to compare non-rotationally symmetric solutions with rotationally symmetric ones.<br/><br/>In the projects discussed above, as well as in many others in my research program, the primary goal is to develop an understanding of the general behavior of large classes of solutions of complicated nonlinear systems of partial differential equations. Such equation systems, which play a major role in our modeling of physical phenomena at the terrestrial scale as well as at the astrophysical/cosmological scale, cannot be solved explicitly. However, using techniques such as those developed and used in this proposal, one can learn a tremendous amount of practical information about the behavior of solutions of these models, and therefore make very useful predictions regarding the behavior of the physical systems modeled by these equation systems."
0.271698,"While lasers are typically thought of as heating objects they shine upon, they have also come to be routinely used in scientific laboratories to make things extremely cold. Laser cooling is capable of refrigerating vapors of atoms to fractions of a degree above absolute zero, where their behavior is governed by quantum physics. In the past three decades, scientists have used these cold atomic vapors as a scientific platform for learning about this quantum regime, and the field has given birth to applications such as atomic clocks and sensors. The chemicals that can be investigated in this way, however, are limited to only a handful by the laser colors available. Extending laser cooling to a broader array of atoms and molecules is desirable for learning about these species and how they interact at a level of detail not possible at room temperature. The research team supported by this program will be studying the application of a different type of laser to cool these difficult species. These so-called ""ultrafast"" lasers can be made to emit an entire rainbow of colors at once, and this program will study how to finesse these sources into laser cooling a wider array of atoms and molecules. Successful extension of laser cooling to these species is expected to find use in the next generation of sensors, computers, and platforms for future science.<br/><br/>Direct laser cooling and trapping using optical frequency combs has the potential to extend laser cooling to more diverse species of atoms and molecules than are currently accessible. This potential arises due to their utility in creating many optical frequencies in parallel in parts of the optical spectrum where doing this with continuous-wave lasers is impractical, such as the deep ultraviolet. The enhanced efficiency with which mode-locked lasers can drive two-photon transitions or be converted to desired wavelengths via nonlinear processes results in utilization of the full power in the comb even if only one tooth is used, making this process efficient. Specifically, researchers supported by this program will use picosecond mode-locked optical frequency combs for direct laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of atoms on two-photon transitions (rubidium, nitrogen) and single-photon laser cooling of diatomic molecules (Strontium Hydride). Time-dependent sweeps of the comb will also be investigated as a method for beam slowing and trap capture that would be applicable to a wider array of species than Zeeman slowing, such as diatomics. Development of a widely-applicable technique for cooling of molecules would have payoffs, including the ability to address significant unknowns in the fields of dipolar quantum gases, quantum simulations, controlled chemistry, and quantum computing."

The next generations of particle accelerators are being designed to explore the frontiers of high-energy physics and for xray beams for research in biology, chemistry, physics, material science and medicine. Accelerator science research is necessary to gain greater understanding of the physical processes that can impact the performance of these accelerators and develop new techniques of particle acceleration technology. The accelerator science research will be conducted at two of the premier laboratories in the United States in accelerator science, the Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education (CLASSE) at Cornell University and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.<br/><br/>This award will use the Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring Test Accelerator (CesrTA), to examine important beam physics, such as the electron cloud effect, emittance limitations in storage rings, and the fast ion instability, for future lepton storage rings and x-ray sources. One of the key goals of the CesrTA research program is to improve our understanding of the interaction of the electron cloud with the high-energy particle beam. The electron cloud constrains many of the operational parameters of the storage ring such as beam current; bunch spacing, ring energy, and these parameters can be measured experimentally on CesrTA. Beam dynamics experiments using the CesrTA beam diagnostics capable of quantifying bunch-by-bunch and turn-by-turn beam dynamics will be used to study important lepton storage ring beam dynamics in the presence of the electron cloud. In addition, we conduct basic accelerator science research on crystal channeling at the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET) and the End Station A Test Beam (ESTB) facility at SLAC. Channeling is the phenomenon that arises when charged particles become trapped between the crystal planes due to the electrostatic field of the crystal ions. There is strong interest in using bent crystals as collimators and magnets for high-energy electron and positron beams and well as using crystals as generators of gamma-rays as a positron crystal undulator. The development of a crystal undulator opens the prospect of creation of novel light sources that will find their application in technology, medicine and basic sciences. Both accelerator science research projects provide Cal Poly undergraduate students research opportunities at large accelerator facilities in accelerator science.

0.255,"A stationary inertial Alfvén wave (StAIW) is a nonfluctuating, nontravelling, spatially periodic pattern in the electromagnetic field and fluid quantities, predicted analytically and now being documented in the lab, that explains with a model certain observed morphology and dynamics of long-lived auroral arcs, the source mechanism causing these features, and the evolution from the background state of the magnetosphere for cases of arc duration longer than 10 seconds. A lab experiment will be performed to validate the space-relevant predictions of the StIAW model. The StIA-wave parallel dc electric field accelerates electrons along magnetic field (z direction) to speeds in excess of the Alfvén speed and the ultimate electron velocity gain parallel to the magnetic field will be measured in the lab at various z positions, with a double-sided Mach probe, and compared to a model. Lab documentation of the existence of the StIAW dc parallel electric field in spite of the rapid charge-imbalance compensation ability of electrons along magnetic field lines would be a significant milestone in the space physics field because source, dynamics, and morphology, all three, of stable, long-lived auroral arcs would be explained in a single model. <br/><br/>The planned research will support student mentoring having an international perspective at WVU and UCLA. The planned research strengthens the interrelationship between plasma experiments in the lab and in space that is aimed at targeted validation of geoscience phenomena. Space plasma dynamics, instability, and particle energization represent the broader application of the proposed basic plasma research.

0.2,"There is large and expanding array of problems in fundamental physics (ranging from sub-nuclear structure of matter through astrophysics and cosmology) which deal with systems whose theoretical description involves continuously many variables with strong interconnection between them. Quantum field theory is a unifying mathematical language for such systems. Appropriately, this language is difficult, and in general its ""grammatical rules"" are not even yet established. In this situation, any instances, or ""models"", of quantum field theory whose equations can be worked out all the way through are especially valuable. Such models are known as ""integrable quantum field theories"". Mainly, they serve as the testing ground for verification and development of ideas and mathematical methods, but remarkably many integrable ""models"" directly apply to theoretical understanding of properties of complex materials. That is why today the integrable quantum field theories constitute one of the most important and actively developed area of mathematical physics. Moreover, since the discovery of ""gauge/string duality"" and the role of integrability in this relation, this field of research has found itself at the cutting edge of theoretical high-energy physics. Unfortunately, the integrable models emerging in this context still resist full solution. This research project proposes further development of integrable quantum field theories, with emphasis on the so-called integrable sigma models. This is exactly the general class of models which emerge in the context of the gauge/string duality. Also, similar models are believed to provide theoretical understanding of particularly complicated disordered systems in physics of materials. It is proposed to develop a certain new class of integrable sigma-models, with novel mathematical structure, and find full solutions. This is an intermediate step in the approach to the systems of direct application in the gauge/string dualities. Interestingly, mathematical methods developed for integrable quantum field theories turn out to have broader significance in mathematical physics, and often help to investigate a wider class of non-integrable systems. This area will be explored as well.<br/><br/>The activity consists of three projects. (1) Analysis of a new class of integrable sigma models whose target spaces are deformed group manifolds. With the most general known deformations, quantum integrability of such models require significant modifications of standard tools such as the Lax representations, the Yang-Baxter algebras, and Baxter's Q operators and their relations. The project's goal is to develop all such modifications, and use that as the basis for finding full solutions. The key to our approach will be the so-called ODE/IQFT correspondence, the new mathematical tool of integrable quantum field theories (""IQFT side"") which allows to ""encode"" its algebraic structures into a system of ordinary differential equations (""ODE"" side). This project lays in the mainstream of the current research in mathematical physics; its significance is in the relation to the gauge/string dualities, and possibly to physics of disordered systems. The other two parts the research is to explore applications of the methods of integrability in non-integrable systems. (2) The relation between the 't Hooft's equation in 1+1 QCD and the Baxter's T-Q equation will be used to analyze the meson decays and scattering amplitudes in the large-N expansion, with the ultimate goal of gaining universal tools for analysis of decays and amplitudes in generic 1+1 systems with confining interactions, which are very common in condensed matter physics. (3) The third part addresses possibility of emergence of near-integrable subsystems in otherwise non-integrable quantum field theories, the possibility which was not previously explored."
0.66975,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
0.75,"One of the frontier areas of nuclear physics is the study of the structure of atomic nuclei far from the valley of stability. In atomic nuclei the single-particle orbitals are expected to change as a function of neutron and proton number, and in addition are very sensitive to the presence of deformation. Single-particle characteristics can be probed in single-particle transfer reactions. Light-ion transfer reactions will be studied with beam energies near the Coulomb barrier and about 40-MeV per nucleon. Studies will concentrate on neutron-rich nuclei near the N=50 and N=82 neutron shell closures and light nuclei important to understand nucleosynthesis in stars. These studies will be carried out with accelerated beams of rare isotopes at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University, the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory and the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. One focus is to extract spectroscopic strengths with reduced dependence on theoretical model parameters. <br/><br/>Another challenge in nuclear structure physics is to understand the balance between a microscopic description of the nuclear wave function and a model based on collective motions of the nucleons within the nucleus. This balance changes as a function of excitation energy and angular momentum and may be quite different in nuclei away from the valley of stability from the observed behavior of nuclei near stability. The focus of the second component of this proposal addresses, via measurements of the magnetic moments of excited states, the interplay of single-particle configurations with an underlying spherical or deformed core. The technique of Coulomb excitation in inverse kinematics is well established and has been tested on radioactive beams (RIBs). However, recent high statistics experiments carried out with heavier nuclei than in the past, and with higher energy beams, have uncovered several issues that need to be addressed before the methods are tried at the new RIB facilities. Semi-magic Tin-126 will be studied at HRIBF. A new program of research to be established at the ATLAS facility will focus initially on the low-lying states of Samarium-150 and Gadolinium-152 and on the efficacy of alpha transfer reactions. <br/><br/>The structure of the proposed activities is designed to have as large an impact as possible on the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as postdoctoral associates. The project will also serve to enhance the diversity of the nuclear science workforce by including early career scientists who are women or come from other under-represented backgrounds. The participation of these early career scholars in the forefront research would prepare them for careers in higher education and basic and applied research, in national laboratories and industry. <br/><br/>The anticipated nuclear physics results are also of importance in astronomy, to understand the abundance of elements observed in the cosmos; in condensed matter physics, to understand the microscopic components of the transient hyperfine field; and for nuclear energy and national security, to understand properties of and reactions on fission fragments."
0.447,"The coupling of a particle to its surroundings enables important condensed-matter phenomena such as the formation of polarons in solid-state and low-temperature systems, and is a central concept in the study of decoherence and dissipation. This project focuses on the experimental study of such coupled systems using mixtures of ultracold bosonic atoms trapped in an optical lattice. Using a hyperfine-ground state mixture of bosonic atoms in state-dependent optical lattices allows for the immersion of localized atoms in a bosonic background medium. One of the goals of the projectis to detect polaronic energy shifts and clustering spectroscopically in the limit of strong interactions. Another goal is to study the dynamics of a localized, driven atomic spin coupled to a bosonic superfluid as a simple realization of a spin-boson model for the study of quantum dissipative effects. Using state-dependent potentials as a manipulation tool, a third goal is to study out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional spin mixtures with the possibility of observing spin-charge separation. <br/><br/>The elucidation of behavior specific to complex materials will have the potential for broad scientific and technological impact that can ultimately benefit society. The project will advance the state of the art of quantum-gas research in this direction, and it will also provide scientific and technical training to both graduate and undergraduate students who will gain proficiency in the enabling technologies of lasers and optics, ultrahigh vacuum, and electronics."
0.455,"This work is focused on developing our understanding of strong field molecular ionization by using pulse shaping, velocity map imaging detection of molecular fragment ions and close collaboration with theory. Our research program draws upon our previous NSF funded work on strong field coherent control, and is composed of three main thrusts. First is the study of electron wave packets generated via strong field ionization. Strong field ionization in an intense ultrafast laser pulse can result in the population of multiple ionic states and the generation of attosecond electron dynamics. We are interested in characterizing which ionic states are populated and how this depends on laser pulse parameters. The study of molecular ionization from electronically excited molecules comprises our second thrust area. By studying ionization from electronically excited states, we can investigate the validity of Dyson overlap projections for strong field ionization and deepen our understanding of electron correlation in molecules. Our third area is following neutral excited state relaxation via strong field ionization and velocity map imaging. Strong field ionization has many advantages as a probe of excited state molecular dynamics, providing insight into dissociation and internal conversion.<br/><br/>This research program continually seeks to integrate teaching and research while impacting a large range of participants. People involved in the research include undergraduate students (visiting students through the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program as well as students at Stony Brook University), local high school teachers (through the NSF Research Experience for Teachers program), graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and visiting scholars (through the NSF ROA program). The work is inherently multi-disciplinary, and encourages students to develop knowledge and interests at the boundary between physics and chemistry. It also provides excellent technical and scientific training in the enabling ares of optics, ultrafast laser technology, vacuum hardware, data acquisition hardware and computer programming."
0.54,"A distinction between hydrodynamic turbulence in a bulk fluid, and in one whose flows are restricted to two dimensions, is that energy dissipation at small length scales is generally inhibited in the latter. Under small-length-scale forcing of energy and vorticity into a two-dimensional (2D) fluid, energy is therefore transferred towards larger scales, opposite that of turbulence in a bulk fluid. Most conspicuously, this means that eddies and vortices may merge to form even larger vortices. Two-dimensional quantum turbulence (2DQT) involves the study of 2D turbulence in quantum fluids such as atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In this emerging field of research, numerous open questions generally relate to the dynamics of quantized vortices in superfluids and to the distribution of kinetic energy among length scales. For example, do clusters of quantized vortices of identical circulation naturally emerge in 2DQT flows, as initially predicted by Onsager in 1949? This NSF award supports new experiments aimed at understanding the relationships between vortex distributions, vortex dynamics, and energy spectra in 2DQT. The experimental program of research targeting these topics will utilize highly oblate BECs for the construction of a new imaging system designed to observe vortex dynamics within a BEC, the development of on-demand vortex generation and manipulation methods to study vortex interactions in turbulence with a bottom-up approach, and the study and characterization of developed 2DQT in BECs.<br/><br/>Superfluids such as dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates have remarkable properties, including frictionless flow and fluid circulation that is obtained only by the formation of many microscopic quantum whirlpools known as vortices. The distribution and dynamics of these vortices throughout the superfluid provide information on fluid phenomena such as turbulence. This project is studying the generation of quantum vortices and follows their dynamics in pancake-shaped condensates as a means to understand the characteristics of two-dimensional turbulence in superfluids. Turbulence in classical fluids is known to share similarities with quantum turbulence in superfluids, but for the specific case of two-dimensional flows, the similarities and differences between the quantum and classical cases are unclear. This grant supports research and graduate-student mentoring and training involving new methods of creating, manipulating, and detecting quantum vortices in condensates, and probes the characteristics of two-dimensional turbulence in these superfluids. Through controlled studies of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, our aim is to develop new insights on vortex interactions and other phenomena of turbulence, one of the most challenging and complex topics in physics."
0.516122,"The IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is a one cubic kilometer neutrino telescope at the South Pole with unique capabilities to observe high-energy phenomena in the Universe. Its primary goal is to discover cosmic neutrinos from Active Galactic Nuclei, Gamma Ray Bursts, or other astrophysical sources. The IceCube design makes it possible to discover extra-terrestrial point sources of muon-neutrino flux as well as a diffuse flux of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos that may originate from multiple sources.<br/><br/>This award will provide support for this group to analyze data obtained with the recently completed ICNO. They plan to measure the spectrum of yet unobserved high energy (~ TeV neutrino energies) atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades and to make sensitive searches for the diffuse flux of neutrino-induced muons. The combination of these search channels is anticipated to enhance the discovery potential of all-flavor diffuse neutrino flux searches. Once a signal is observed, the information about the neutrino flavor composition at Earth can be used to study the initial flavor composition of these fluxes at their source. The group will also study directional cascade reconstruction to search for up- and down-going neutrino-induced high energy cascades. This serves both astrophysical purposes and also the PI's longer-term interest to gain sensitivity to the high-energy neutrino-nucleon scattering cross section. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this award involve Stony Brook University's educational and outreach programs. The PI will take part in the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program, which is designed to increase the number of women in science, math, and engineering. This will consist of a WISE introductory research course unit on cosmic ray research and detection, and in facilitating related research opportunities for undergraduate WISE students. The group will also participate in outreach activities for local high school teachers and students through K-12 and Summer programs organized by the Center for Science and Mathematics Education (CESAME) and in activities aimed at the general public, such as the Stony Brook Astronomy Open Nights."
0.164994,"Polarized light (light with directional vibrations whose effects can sometimes be seen in changes in attenuation while rotating polarizing sunglasses) is everywhere--it is in the blue sky, the reflection from a pond, in light scattering from natural and manmade airborne particles, and in the display screens on our smartphones. The understanding and use of polarized light is central to both the science of light and to applications ranging from medicine to consumer electronics. For example, some of the triumphs of the computer information revolution have been built around manufacturing technologies that require almost unimaginable precision in measurements--many of which are light-based and use the polarization of light in ways that can be precisely controlled and measured. The proposed research uses the concept of an ""unconventional polarization state"" - a special form of light in which the polarization varies across the width of a laser beam - to explore fundamentally new ways of carrying out light-based measurements. In conjunction with some special optical devices, it is possible to use an ordinary camera to create a visual map of the polarization in a single image, something that ordinarily requires a sequence of four or more images and accompanying algorithms. These measurement methods will also spur new ways of thinking about how to execute the simultaneous measurement of sub-nanometer process errors in microelectronics manufacturing.<br/><br/>The multiple measurements required to characterize the polarization of an ultrafast laser pulse or individual photon require either a time-sequential operation or explicit division of the amplitude into different detector ports. While each of these has been used to good success, there is a need to truly extend polarization measurements in a way that the maximum amount of polarization information is extracted from each measured photon (in the case of low light levels) or each pulse (in the case of ultrafast pulse characterization). Because the method is extendable to the mapping of polarization over a sampled image field, it is possible to extend the concept to capture either angle- or frequency-resolved polarization information in a single image. The investigation also applies the new physics of unconventional polarization states to the now-famous physics of weak measurements by using unconventionally polarized light to measure two or more physical quantities in a single measurement. This concept will be tested by measuring nanoscale features in a microscope equipped with a liquid crystal controller that defines a field with arbitrary polarization, amplitude, and phase for focused beam scatterometry. The work is expected to impact allied areas of physics (through the introduction of new measurement methods), optical engineering (specifically, polarization engineering and image formation), biomedical optics (in medical imaging and spectroscopy), environmental science (through the use of polarimetric light scattering for aerosol characterization), and semiconductor inspection."
0.45,"This project builds on the breakthrough observation of accelerated decay (Purcell) of the resonant near-field coupling between two ""oscillators"" -- one the typical gain of a single semiconductor quantum well (InGaAs) and the other the very strong absorption of an array of metallic (silver) split ring resonators with very large dipole moments. The observation of this coupling is possible because of the giant vacuum field produced by the split ring resonator having a mode volume, V, a thousand times smaller than the minimum V for a photonic crystal slab cavity fabricated in a dielectric (silicon or GaAs). One can predict from the quantum well results that one should even be able to see coupling between such a resonator and a single stationary quantum dot -- the principal goal of this project -- thus opening a new regime for light-matter (resonator-emitter) interaction. Usually, Purcell enhancement (proportional to Q/V) is achieved in a dielectric cavity of very high quality factor, Q. Thus, enhancement occurs only for an emitter lying within the very narrow range of frequencies of the cavity peak. In contrast here, the Q of the split ring resonator is only of order 10; nonetheless, the Purcell enhancement is still large because of the metallic resonator's very tiny mode volume. Consequently, emitters with transitions lying anywhere within the very broad resonance are subjected to a very large vacuum field and have their spontaneous emission accelerated, resulting in overlap of their radiatively broadened spectra.<br/><br/>The results of fundamental atomic and semiconductor cavity QED research have had lasting impact on semiconductor laser technology. A specific ongoing example is the development of the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) pioneered by a graduate from this group. Single quantum dot cavity QED enables nanoscience to go beyond traditional nonlinear optics and laser physics into a new regime with dynamical processes and active devices now involving quantum dots and photons taken one by one. This research on quantum optics in monolithic solid-state cavities would continue to forge new links between the AMO and nanophotonics communities begun by the observation of strong coupling reported in a highly-cited Nature article."

0.107267,"Electrons play a fundamental role in most natural and laboratory phenomena. These elementary particles are extremely light and agile--they can move inside atoms, molecules and materials on the timescale of ""attoseconds,"" which is a billionth of a billionth of a second. To understand the functioning of physical, chemical, and biological processes, it is important to be able to resolve and control the underlying fast electronic motion. Newly devised attosecond techniques provides exactly such an opportunity, using light pulses to strobe the dynamics of electrons. However, most initial studies in this field have been conducted on simple systems like atoms and small molecules. The researchers supported by this program will develop and extend attosecond techniques to the study of complex molecules and materials, where one or more electrons are interacting with each other. Success along these directions will open up opportunities for direct investigation of many biochemical and nanomaterial processes relevant for light harvesting and energy storage. The proposed program will therefore advance the state of science by building bridges between the field of physics, and those of chemistry, biology, and material sciences. The project will also train the next generation of scientists belonging to diverse backgrounds in this emerging and interdisciplinary research field.<br/><br/>Electronic correlation often dominates the excitation and relaxation dynamics of photo-excited molecules and nanomaterials, manifesting itself in the energy and charge redistribution mechanisms in important natural and laboratory processes, such as photosynthesis, repair and damage or DNA, energy storage at molecule-semiconductor interfaces etc. This research project aims at the investigation of correlation-driven physical and chemical phenomena using various types of ultrafast spectroscopy. The high temporal resolution required for these studies will be achieved through the generation of isolated attosecond pulses using double optical gating or similar schemes. The scientific objectives of this program will be to: (1) investigate coherent charge migration dynamics in polyatomic molecules, such as those consisting of a phenyl group, (2) study the coherence in electron wavepacket dynamics and the origin of decoherence mechanisms, and (3) probe the generation and dynamics of high energy excitons in carbon nanomaterials (e.g. graphene). These objectives will be achieved while training graduate and undergraduate students in the field of attosecond physics. Two powerful experimental techniques will be utilized in the proposed measurements: velocity map imaging and attosecond transient absorption. The investigations outlined in the proposal will provide the building blocks for developing a better understanding of the inner-workings of natural and practically relevant phenomena. Collaborations with theorists will play crucial role in the interpretation of results obtained in this unchartered territory, potentially leading to the development of new theoretical models."

0.229924,"This award funds the research of Professor Nikita Nekrasov of SUNY Stony Brook. All known interactions of elementary particles are described by mathematical symmetries called gauge symmetries. The Standard Model of elementary particles is described by such a gauge symmetry. In physical systems there are often several ground states which describe the system (ice and water at the freezing point has two ground states, for example), and gauge symmetries are no exception. This research will study the different ground states of various systems, including gauge theories. It has recently been realized that the ground states of some systems can be related closely to ground states of very different systems. For example, phase transitions in condensed matter systems are closely related to the possible ground states of gauge theories; ground states of strongly correlated electron systems are related to those in quantum information theory, etc. This synergistic research in mathematical physics offers the possibility of connecting what appear to be very different physical systems. Connections between apparently different systems have had great impact in the past. The study of superconductivity by Landau and Ginzburg led to the Higgs mechanism of the Standard Model, the purely mathematical study of the Riemann zeta function led to a better understanding of prime numbers and this has had major impact in cryptography, and the mathematical study of string theory has led to a better understanding of the properties of strongly interacting particles such as protons and pions.<br/><br/>This award is for support of theoretical research and education on gauge theory in various space-time dimensions, models of statistical physics relevant for strongly correlated electron systems and the theory of phase transitions, and models of string theory relevant for studies of strongly coupled phenomena and the nature of space-time at fundamentally small scales. <br/><br/>The unique nature of this project is the broad impact of the cluster of questions being investigated. It touches upon the gauge theories describing the interactions of fundamental particles, the kind studied at the LHC experiment at CERN and at others machines all over the world, and the gauge theories with various degrees of supersymmetry, theoretical laboratories for testing ideas of importance for phenomenology; the quasi-one and two-dimensional strongly correlated electron systems studied in different laboratories in connection with quantum information on the one hand and superconductivity on the other hand; mathematical questions of algebraic geometric and topological nature, functional analysis and the study of spectra of Schroedinger operators and their non-hermitian analogues; foundations of quantum mechanics and the very art of quantization; topological strings and the topological quantum gravity.<br/><br/>The unifying theme in all these problems is the reduction of the non-perturbative partition function of gauge/string theory computed in a specific supergravity background to a statistical mechanical model. The correlation functions of the statistical model are related to matrix elements of generators of some infinite dimensional algebraic structure. It is planned to use the techniques and methods of all the fields of research mentioned above. Specifically, it is planned to generalize the Ward and Dyson-Schwinger identities of quantum field theory to incorporate non-perturbative phenomena. The intention is to establish, using these identities, that the gauge theories, at least supersymmetric gauge theories, possess a new type of symmetry, at least in the low-energy regime, which is a deformation of conventional symmetries of two dimensional conformal field theories. Using these symmetries it is hoped to find new geometric and algebraic structures in the landscape of vacua of grand unified theories and possibly even string compactifications. <br/><br/>The research lies at the interface of several domains of theoretical physics and several domains of mathematics and provides a good environment for training graduate students."

This position now goes to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (proton-proton), but the Tevatron still has some advantages because it is a proton- antiproton collider. This makes a large number of proton and antiproton constituent particles, quark-antiquark collisions, as opposed to the LHC collisions that are dominated by intermediary particles called gluons. This enables unique measurements of quark-dominated processes, including some aspects of single top quark production via the Electroweak interaction and asymmetries between forward and backward produced top quarks or hadrons containing bottom quarks.<br/><br/>Analysis of the D0 data continues with some 40 additional publications expected over the next two years.

The specific goals are to understand the stick-slip excitation mechanism of idiophones and to determine how structural vibrations affect the sound of brass wind instruments. Studies of the stick-slip excitation of idiophones will be performed using electronic speckle pattern interferometery, laser Doppler vibrometry and recordings of the acoustic field resulting from the vibrations. The results of the experimental research will be compared to a computer model that includes the dynamic effects, as well as the effects attributable to the size of the region of interaction between the instrument and the driver. Studies of structural vibrations of brass wind instruments will involve both optical and acoustic measurements. Previous work has shown that the vibration of the walls of the instrument contribute substantially to the sound produced by the instrument, and that this contribution is not due to direct radiation of the vibrating metal into the surrounding air. This research will lead to an understanding of the mechanism through which the vibrating metal contributes to the sound field.<br/><br/>This work involves undergraduate students, particularly women, in original research.

0.3,"This project has as its main objective to develop new methods that strengthen the quantum interface between atoms and light, and to use this as a tool for enhanced control of the quantum mechanical spin associated with a collection of atoms. The central idea is that by preparing certain non-trivial states of the internal atomic spins, one can greatly increase the sensitivity of a laser probe to quantum uncertainty in the collective spin. In that situation, using the laser probe to perform an accurate measurement of the spin will reduce, or squeeze, quantum noise on the spin below currently achievable levels. Further control of the internal spins can convert such spin squeezing into forms that improve the performance of atomic clocks, magnetometers, or matter-wave based inertial sensors.<br/><br/>The research contributes to the knowledge basis of quantum metrology and quantum information science. Short-term applications include future generations of quantum-limited clocks and sensors, while long-term applications are possible in quantum memories and other hardware required for the nodes in quantum communication networks. Graduate students are involved in all aspects of the project, including training, research, and the dissemination of results. The project is a cornerstone of the NSF-supported Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), co-located at the University of Arizona and the University of New Mexico. As such, it contributes to the training of a wider group of future scientists and engineers in the highly interdisciplinary field of quantum information science."
1.605,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Maria C. Gonzalez-Garcia, Christopher P. Herzog, Leonardo Rastelli, Martin Rocek, Robert Shrock, Warren Siegel and George Sterman at Stony Brook University.<br/><br/>These research activities span a wide range of topics in theoretical physics, largely based on quantum field theory and string theory. Recent years have seen a renaissance of engagement between theory and experiment in particle physics, with new and exciting data from the Large Hadron Collider, from neutrino observatories and from cosmic ray satellites. These new sources of information about our universe enable theorists to test long-standing ideas against evolving data, and to develop new theoretical methods to guide experiment. At the same time, novel applications of quantum field and string theory have been developed in and beyond particle physics, opening unexpected avenues of research into nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum information, sometimes with applications in pure mathematics. As active participants in these historic developments, the senior personnel of this award will continue and develop their work in high energy collider physics, neutrino and astroparticle physics, applications of gauge-gravity duality, extensions of the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry breaking, leptogenesis, superstrings, the geometry of supersymmetric gauge theories, and the theory of the strong interactions. <br/><br/>By advancing our knowledge of the laws of nature and by contributing to a better understanding of the physical universe, this research has significant broader impacts and implications for our world view. Indeed, many of the topics under study by the senior participants are frequently discussed in the media, such as the discovery of the Higgs boson, the role of neutrinos in the Universe, string theory and the quark-gluon plasma. The research outlined in this proposal will also serve in the training of graduate students and mentoring of postdoctoral fellows. The faculty on this proposal conduct their research with graduate students, and share their experience and expertise with undergraduates and community members, in and beyond the classroom."
0.3691,"The field of quantum information science is an intensely pursued research area due to the technological impact that a realized quantum computer would have. The availability of a trustworthy quantum processor would revamp numerous aspects of science and engineering, including the optimization of chemical reactions, the development of ultra-secure communication channels, and the materialization of powerful computers. After nearly twenty years of experimental research, technologies have emerged that may serve as the elementary building blocks for a quantum processor. Among these are technologies associated with the interaction of photons and atoms. The supported research group aims to develop a milestone towards building a quantum processor: the realization of an interface between two single photons and atoms in a configuration designed to perform logic operations at the quantum level.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to fully characterize a proof of principle system capable of a two-qubit operation using light. To accomplish this goal the supported research group will interface two of the most powerful tools in quantum optics; that of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) for strong light-matter coupling and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) to allow control of large optical nonlinearities. The research program will pursue two primary objectives. First, the group will finish construction of the first experimental setup in which two cavities are coupled simultaneously to a 87Rb ensemble, thereby creating an interaction medium for two independent optical modes (qubits). Under EIT conditions, the cavity fields will experience an enhanced interaction strength permitting the observation of nonlinear effects using single-photon fields, the essential component of a quantum optical gate. Once achieved, the second objective is to fully characterize the gate operation using a technique known as coherent state quantum process tomography (csQPT). This tool allows the characterization of quantum optical processes, such as gates, using only coherent states which are readily available from a common laser source."

Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics at Stony Brook University.<br/><br/>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has finally started to deliver large amounts of data, probing the universe at energies that have never been directly explored before now. During the next few years, the mechanism responsible for the origin of all mass for fundamental particles in the universe will be discovered. Professor Meade's research will be focused on the interplay of theoretical physics, phenomenology and experiment. This interplay is key to either discovering the ""new"" Standard Model (SM) or completing the last missing ingredients from the existing SM of particle physics. Part of his work will be based on studying the ramifications of existing ideas such as Supersymmetry, while other aspects of his research will focus on more exotic models motivated by experimental results. Professor Meade's research will also investigate the connections between astrophysics, cosmology and our continually evolving understanding of particle physics.<br/><br/>This project also plans to have significant broader impacts. Professor Meade plans to participate in the MARIACHI program, an existing program for high school students that provides research opportunities in high energy/astroparticle physics through cosmic ray research. He will also participate in the ""adopt-a-physicist"" program designed to share the experiences of active physicists with high school students, to promote the benefits of studying physics. Professor Meade also plans to engage local magnet schools via curriculum development or lectures, designed to bring our current understanding of particle physics from the LHC to future scientists more directly."
8.45,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva Switzerland is the world's premier particle collider facility in operation. By recording the collisions of protons at the LHC, the ATLAS experiment studies nature at the shortest distances and highest masses ever accessible in a laboratory. In essence, it is simultaneously the world's most powerful microscope and an experiment creating conditions that existed in nature only near the time of the Big Bang. Studies there have already led to discovery of a new fundamental particle, the Higgs Boson. This discovery is of such high scientific impact that the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics was given to the people who first predicted the existence of this particle.<br/><br/>This NSF award enables upgrades of the ATLAS experimental apparatus needed for high precision studies of Higgs Boson properties and a wide variety of searches for particles needed to explain unresolved puzzles. An example of one such puzzle is ""What is the dark matter which makes up nearly 30% of the universe""? There are many other similar questions. The next three years represent a transition of the LHC physics program from a collision energy of 8 Teraelectronvolts (TeV) data-taking and operation, to extended operations and data taking at nearly double the energy, 13-14 TeV. Over a thousand scientists from the United States are involved with this scientific program on several major experiments.<br/><br/>This award provides support for Dr. Hobbs at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and his collaborators at three U.S. universities to upgrade the ATLAS detector so that it can continue to operate efficiently at higher energies for a longer time and at a higher rate. This upgrade will enable scientists to collect data to search for new physics to explain inconsistencies in the particle theory that arise as the energy is increased and to fully understand how the Higgs boson fits into a fundamental theory of the universe.<br/><br/>The universities supported by this award will build new instrumentation to be installed in the ATLAS detector, which is necessary in order to carry out a real-time selection and collection of data and provide a better measurement of particle energies. In addition to producing results which advance fundamental scientific knowledge, the work associated with these upgrades trains students, young researchers and technicians to carry out basic research by formulating questions and procedures to understand what is not known, and it also trains them to develop and operate complex, custom electronics systems and advanced computer algorithms needed to sustain extremely high data rates and classify large, complex data sets in fractions of a second."
0.21,"This research will investigate important issues of quantum computational universality in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), explore connections of MBQC to ideas in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics, and other quantum computational models. Specifically, the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models supply a rich playground for exploring new universal resource states and for understanding the intricate relations of quantum computational universality to percolation, spatial connectivity, magnetic order, and phase transitions in computational power. The long standing open question of the existence of a finite spectral of any two-dimensional rotationally symmetric (including AKLT) Hamiltonians is important also for the stability of generating related resource states by cooling. This will be studied with both analytic and numerical means. The research also includes searching for new types of resource states and developing model Hamiltonians whose thermal states can be used for quantum computation without the need to switch off interactions. Furthermore, this program studies how topological order can be of use to quantum computation, and conversely, how MBQC offers an efficient means to create a large class of topologically ordered states. <br/>Intellectual Merit: MBQC is one of the several models for building quantum computers. Essentially, all that is needed is a suitable highly entangled resource state to begin with and the ability to perform local measurements. This approach of realizing a quantum computer is promising with several physical systems, such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and photons, complementing other approaches of implementing quantum computation. MBQC also provides a conceptual framework for answering fundamental questions in quantum computation and for bridging to other areas of research. The questions that will be addressed include: (1) What entangled states can qualify as an universal resource and can they arise as unique ground states of physically reasonable Hamiltonians? A complete understanding may lead to novel characterization of states of matter in terms of computational capability. (2) Is there a generalized Haldane conjecture in higher dimensions and how to test it? Tackling the long standing open question of the spectral gaps of two-dimensional AKLT Hamiltonians will give insight to a possible generalized Haldane conjecture in 2D and pave the road for probing richer phases in isotropic spin Hamiltonians in higher dimensions. (3) Can topological order provide insight to the quest of new resource states? (4) Are there advantages over others that the MBQC model offers? The research findings of MBQC from this program will not only advance our knowledge on various aspects of quantum computation and its connection to ideas in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics, but also have potential impact on future quantum computer technology. <br/>Broader Impacts : The PI is taking the initiative in organizing a forum for discussing scientific results in quantum information science and stimulating collaboration across disciplines at Stony Brook University. He will integrate his research on quantum computation in the courses that he is currently and will be developing for both undergraduate and graduate students. This project will also include training of a graduate student and mentoring of a postoctoral researcher."

0.138771,"Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high-energy gamma-rays. VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. This award supports scientists at Iowa State University to carry out research with VERITAS. The group will work on new data analysis techniques to improve the study of spatially-extended sources and to facilitate the joint analysis of data from multiple observatories. Using these new analysis techniques the group will conduct a systematic study of Galactic sources of particle acceleration, and ultimately search for signatures of dark matter. The group will work with the Iowa State University planetarium developing multi-wavelength astronomy and high-energy astrophysics shows, displays, and demonstrations. <br/><br/><br/>The PI has adapted a maximum likelihood framework for VERITAS data analysis that will be extended to enable simultaneous fitting of data from multiple instruments. In addition, the PI will implement a new background estimation method based on this maximum likelihood framework that will improve the analysis of extended sources. Together, these developments will help maximize the impact of the VERITAS long-term science program. The PI will perform a systematic study of Galactic particle accelerators such as supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae, their interaction with their immediate environment, and the evolution of the particles they produce, along with more long-range work searching regions of high dark matter density for the gamma-ray signature of dark matter self-annihilation."

0.781263,"This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics--Experiment Program in the Physics (PHY) Division in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS), and the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics--Theory Program in PHY/MPS, and the Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology--Theory Program in PHY/MPS, and the Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology Program in the Astronomy (AST) Division of MPS, and the Science, Technology, and Society Program in the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE), and the Division of Graduate Education (DGE) in the Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR),and the Office of Integrative Activities and the Office of International Science and Engineering. For nearly a century, physicists have used quantum mechanics to understand many properties of the physical world, from the behavior of atoms and molecules to the nuclear forces that govern sub-atomic particles. Predictions from the theory have matched experimental observations to impeccable accuracy. Conceptually, however, the theory includes some strikingly strange features. Among the most curious is known as ""quantum entanglement."" According to quantum mechanics, particles that have been prepared in a special way can retain a connection, even after they have moved arbitrarily far apart from each other--a property which Albert Einstein dubbed ""spooky actions at a distance."" Nowadays entanglement is at the heart of many cutting-edge technologies, including quantum encryption and quantum computing. Yet every experimental test of quantum entanglement to date has been subject to various loopholes: alternative explanations, different than quantum theory, that might account for the long-distance correlations in the particles' behavior. In this project, the principal investigators aim to address the most stubborn, and least studied, of these loopholes, known as the ""setting independence loophole."" To shield against any unintended coordination between the particles and the measurement apparatus--coordination that could mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics--the selection of which properties of the particles to be measured will be determined by real-time observation of some of the oldest light in our universe: light that was emitted from astronomical objects so far away from Earth and from each other that neither object would have been able to receive any signals from each other prior to the moment they emitted the light that is observed on Earth today. The new series of experiments will thus test entanglement on an entirely new scale. If, as expected, the results match the predictions from quantum mechanics, then any alternatives will be ruled out or severely constrained, and new technologies such as quantum encryption will be placed on the strongest possible footing. If, on the other hand, the experiment finds novel departures from predictions, that could point toward profoundly new physics. This project also has an informal education component that will take place through exhibits and programs at the MIT Museum; these will connect the public to the experiment as it evolves in real time, and will be evaluated and widely disseminated. <br/><br/>Experimental tests of Bell's inequality have been subject to several loopholes which hold out the possibility, however slim, that individual particles could possess simultaneously sharp values for noncommuting variables. Such behavior would be at odds with quantum mechanics, and would subject quantum-encryption protocols to new vulnerabilities. The most subtle loophole is known as ""setting independence."" In any test of entanglement, one must select detector settings on each side of the experimental apparatus, choosing to measure, for example, a particle's spin along the x-axis, the y-axis, or some intermediate angle. The usual assumption is that no third party, acting in the shared causal past of the entangled particles and the measurement apparatus, has affected the joint probability distribution for detector settings. Yet even a tiny coordination among detector settings and the entangled particles could mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics. In this series of experiments, the principal investigators aim to address the setting-independence loophole using real-time observations of distant astronomical sources, such as quasars--sources that were causally isolated from each other and from the worldline of the Earth at the time they emitted the light that is observed on Earth today. Any non-quantum-mechanical coordination among elements of the experiment would thereby be pushed back billions of years, in some scenarios back to the big bang itself, an improvement of 20 orders of magnitude over current constraints."
0.54,"Measuring the position of mechanical objects very precisely has several applications in fundamental research as well as in technological devices. In atomic force microscopes (AFM), for example, lasers are used to read out the position of a microscopic cantilever scanning over a surface, with sufficient precision to measure surface variations on the sub-nanometer scale (less than a thousandth of a millionth of a meter--9 zeros past the decimal place). On a completely different size scale, laser light is used to read out the positions of kilogram-scale mirrors of interferometric gravitational wave (GW) detectors with sub-attometer precision (less than a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a meter--18 zeros past the decimal place). Even though these devices occupy very different scales, they are united by similar principles and limitations to precision position measurement. AFM cantilevers, the mirrors of GW detectors, and indeed a large variety of other mechanical oscillators used as tools of quantum information science, as time keepers, as frequency standards, or as other precision sensors have one thing in common. They all seek to operate at the best precision that quantum mechanics allows. When using laser light to measure the position of a mechanical object, the quantum fluctuations of the light, arising from the discrete nature of photons, imposes a limit on how well one can do. This work explores these quantum limits to position measurement in laboratory experiments that span micro-gram to gram scale mechanical oscillators, with the goal of developing techniques for improving position measurements in general, but also with specific applications to GW detectors.<br/><br/>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) seeks to detect GWs emitted by violent cosmic events such as supernova explosions and collisions of neutron stars and black holes. Since GWs are completely distinct from electromagnetic radiation, direct detection of GWs is expected to open a new window into the Universe and provide opportunities to study cosmic phenomena that are ""invisible"" using light alone. GWs from astrophysical sources cause microscopic distortions of spacetime that can be measured by an interferometer whose mirrors are suspended as pendulums to isolate them from all other effects beside the GW. The changes in arm length, typically of order 1e-19 meters (1/10000 the size of a proton!), are detected by very precise measurement of the interference pattern of the laser light reflected from each 4 kilometer long arm of the interferometer. Quantum fluctuations of the light arising from the discrete nature of photons limit the sensitivity of GW detectors. The so-called shot noise, due to the random quantum fluctuations of the light, limits the precision with which the interference pattern, and hence the GW signal, can be measured. Similarly, radiation pressure noise limits the sensitivity due to the interferometer mirrors being ""kicked"" by the fluctuating momentum of the photons that is transferred to the mirrors when the laser light reflects from them. The proposed experimental program comprises cavity optomechanics experiments with gram- and micro-gram scale mechanical oscillators are aimed at studying several radiation pressure induced phenomena, including direct observation quantum radiation pressure (backaction) noise that is expected to be a major limiting noise source in Advanced LIGO; observation and manipulation of optomechanically induced transparency; observation of ponderomotive squeezing, a promising alternative for generation of squeezed states of light; ground state cooling of macroscopic objects; and reaching and surpassing the free-particle Standard Quantum Limit, which would allow for direct tests of quantum non-demolition measurement techniques. The main purpose of this research is to further the understanding of optomechanical systems in the quantum regime focusing on the features most relevant to GW detectors. Equally attractive is the prospect of exploring the fundamental physics of quantum correlations due to light-mirror couplings in a macroscopic mechanical oscillator system."

0.15,"Our modern world is run by electrons--they flow through our smart phones, computers, and machines to carry out a myriad of tasks from data storage and calculations to heavy lifting when employed in electromagnets. It is surprising that we do not better understand how electrons work together. This award supports studies of a novel substance, an ultracold gas of strongly interacting atoms, which behaves in many ways like electrons. For example, just like a metal becomes ""superconducting"" at low temperatures and starts to conduct electricity without resistance, the atomic gas becomes ""superfluid"" and atoms flow without friction. However, scaled to the density of electrons in metals, superfluidity would occur in the atomic gas already far above room temperature, thanks to the strong interatomic interactions. Just like electrons, but also protons and neutrons, the atoms belong to the class of particles called fermions, which cannot share one and the same state. This requirement makes computations extremely difficult and experiments indispensable to learn about the behavior of fermions. Confined in an artificial ""box"" of light, the atomic Fermi gas will be a pristine platform to learn about the equation of state of strongly interacting fermions, as they occur in modern materials, for example high-temperature superconductors, but also in neutron stars and nuclear matter. With the help of these and other studies, we might be led to an understanding on how to realize room temperature superconductivity. The project also holds the potential for observing new states of fermionic matter such as a supersolid--a superfluid that is also ordered like a crystal. The research will present a stimulating learning experience for graduate students.<br/><br/>Ultracold Fermi gases of atoms represent a paradigmatic form of fermionic matter, where all details of the interparticle interaction, the external confinement, and the spin composition are precisely known and under the control of the experimenter. This project employs a Fermi gas of Lithium-6 atoms to try to answer long-standing questions about 1) the thermodynamics of two- and three-dimensional systems, 2) the fate of fermionic superfluidity in the presence of spin imbalance and 3) non-equilibrium dynamics in fermionic superfluids. The Fermi gas will be confined in tailored potentials, in particular a homogeneous box potential and a hybrid harmonic-box potential. Creating a homogeneous Fermi gas will take away many of the existing experimental limitations in obtaining accurate thermodynamic information. The box potential allows accessing new phases of fermionic matter that have not been observed before. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superfluid in two dimensions features algebraic order that would be masked in an inhomogeneous trap. A homogeneous 3D Fermi superfluid in the presence of spin imbalance should spontaneously break translational symmetry by forming a train of solitons, where excess fermions reside in the nodes of the order parameter. This describes the famous Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) state, a supersolid phase of matter that has not been conclusively observed despite five decades of research. In the present work, soliton trains will be directly created in the presence of spin imbalance, thereby engineering the LO state."
0.36,"This award supports ongoing research on the dynamics of binary systems in general relativity, and research on astronomy with gravitational wave observations. This work will further our understanding of how black holes in binary systems interact with one another, and how the signals that will soon be measured with gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO are generated. As part of this work, gravitational wave signals are converted to sound (""sonification"") to create powerful tools for illustrating the impact of gravitational waves for astronomy. Media content will be produced to illustrate how black holes' shapes are dynamically distorted by the tidal field of an orbiting body. This is done not only as part of the dynamical studies but also for communicating the science of gravitational-wave sources to the general public.<br/><br/>The specific projects pursued in this time frame are a mix of studies using black hole perturbation theory, and studies in support of astronomy with the LIGO gravitational wave detectors. Black hole perturbation theory will be studied in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Maryland and Germany to revise and extend the very successful ""effective one body"" (EOB) approach to compact binary dynamics. Work in this program so far has done much to clarify how interactions with a black hole's event horizon affect the evolution of compact binary. Future work will begin to probe orbits with substantial spin-orbit misalignment, laying the groundwork for using the EOB framework on a larger family of astrophysically relevant orbits. Black hole perturbation theory will also be used to understand as precisely as possible how a black hole is distorted by an orbiting body, and how momentary resonances between orbital frequencies can change the system's evolution. In the domain of gravitational wave astronomy, neutron star fluid instabilities will be studied to find out whether they can significantly affect the ability of LIGO and sister instruments to detect binary inspiral. Even if the claimed effect turns out to be incorrect, this will be a valuable exercise in assessing how robust are the techniques that will be used for binary inspiral. Another project will investigate how precisely the calibration of each LIGO instrument must be known in order to accurately pin down the sky position of coalescing binaries. Searching for counterparts to these events with telescopes has become an extremely hot topic in recent years; making sure that LIGO can accurately tell telescopes where to look is crucial for insuring that these searches are fruitful."
1.752097,"This MRI project will build a large, novel magneto-electrostatic spectrometer, highly optimized for precision measurements of four key parameters describing neutron beta decay: ""a"", the electron-neutrino correlation, ""b"", the Fierz interference term, as well as ""A/B/C"", the beta/neutrino/proton asymmetries. The device will be mounted at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline (FnPB) of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The proposed spectrometer will be a premier instrument for precision study (at the level of a part in ~1000) of neutron beta decay in the US and in the world. The experiment is expected to provide critical results toward resolving longstanding discrepancies in the neutron decay world data set. The proposed device, coupled with state of the art neutron beam, will enable the collaboration to set stringent limits on certain processes that would extend the Standard Model, with strong implications in astrophysics. The spectrometer will be developed and built by a consortium comprising University of Virginia (UVa), Arizona State University (ASU), and ORNL, with UVa as the lead institution.<br/><br/>Besides advancing fundamental science, the proposed project's impact is mainly in higher education. The UVa and the ASU groups have established records of training Ph.D. and postdoctoral scientists who have proceeded to assume productive roles in academia, research, and industry. Several undergraduate students will gain valuable research experience working on the proposed project; four have already been deeply involved in the design phase. As well, the PIs' groups have an established record of including members of underrepresented minorities (in recent past there have been two African American Ph.D. students, as well as women Ph.D. students, postdocs, and undergraduate students). The PIs are strongly committed to attracting members of underrepresented groups, to help broaden the human resource base of the field."
0.3,"This award supports a new program of research by the MIT group of Mike Williams on the LHCb Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, Geneva, Switzerland.

For at least the next five years, LHCb will be the premier flavor-physics experiment in the world. Williams has been one of the principal architects of the high-level trigger (HLT) for LHCb in the recent past. This trigger allowed LHCb to collect a nearly 100% pure b-bbar sample during experimental operations in 2011 and 2012. The PI wrote this trigger, making MIT uniquely qualified as a group to prepare the experiment to handle future running conditions, including a collision energy of 13-TeV and significantly higher luminosity. <br/><br/>MIT has a strong record in outreach, and PI Williams will build upon this tradition with links to the LHCb program.

This program provides a unique opportunity for minority students to experience life at a large research institute. Beginning in the summer of 2013, students from this program will be able to do flavor-physics research using LHCb data."
0.36,"Intellectual Merit: This project will address several fundamental questions relevant to how the quantum electronic behavior of electrons in isolated atoms are modified in the presence of other atoms, and to what extent that behavior can be controlled and manipulated using lasers and electric fields. The experiments will utilize ultra-cold gases of atoms with one highly-excited ""Rydberg"" electron. Such atoms are useful because: they are particularly sensitive to neighboring atoms; the motion of electrons within them is sufficiently slow that it can be probed with very brief laser pulses; and the relative positions of the atoms themselves can be strongly influenced by the forces between atoms. One experiment will attempt to induce electronic motion in one atom and establish conditions where that motion can be spontaneously transferred to an electron in a neighboring atom. Another will explore the conditions in which a group of excited atoms act as a single quantum mechanical unit, emitting radiation collectively rather than individually. Further work will utilize lasers to induce transient repulsive interactions between pairs of atoms, preventing hard collisions between them, and possibly creating ordered atomic arrays that mimic condensed matter systems. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Results from the project have the potential to impact fundamental science in several active research areas outside of atomic physics, including condensed matter physics, quantum information, and quantum control. Beyond these scientific connections and associated applications, the greatest near-term societal benefit of the project will be the education of the participating graduate and undergraduate students. Students involved in the project will gain valuable experience with state-of-the-art laser equipment and techniques as well as training in scientific ethics and methodology. They will develop written and oral presentation skills, and travel to conferences where they will present and defend their results as well as establish professional contacts. They will participate in group meetings and develop group problem solving skills in the laboratory. Moreover, their interactions with chemistry and engineering students, postdocs, and faculty in a shared multi-disciplinary laser laboratory will provide opportunities to learn about laboratory techniques used in other disciplines, as well differences in scientific cultures, language and terminology. These young women and men are the next generation of scientists and engineers. Their experiences with the project will enable them to contribute to laser, photonics, and other industries; develop new technologies for national defense and security applications; and/or educate another generation of scientists and engineers."
0.6,"This project encompasses an integrated education and research plan in the field of evolutionary systems biology. The research objective of the project is to use quantitative experiments with microbes to investigate evolutionary dynamics on rugged fitness landscapes. Major advances in biophysics and evolutionary systems biology have resulted from the emergence of a new field integrating quantitative microbial experiments together with theoretical studies in evolutionary dynamics. A unifying theme in much of this research is the richness of the evolutionary phenomena that emerges from rugged fitness landscapes. This ruggedness is the result of interactions between different mutations. Such interactions can be caused by physical interactions within a protein (epistasis), network interactions within decision-making modules in the cell, or social interactions between different members of a population. The proposed research project uses the evolution of antibiotic resistance as a model system to explore the evolutionary dynamics that result from these various forms of interactions. The lessons learned will provide new insight into the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project follow from the close integration between the research project and an extensive education and outreach effort. Using experience gained from ten weeks of studying undergraduate science education as a Fellow at the National Academy of Sciences with the Board on Science Education, the PI will create an extensive set of conceptual ConcepTest Questions in Physical, Systems, and Evolutionary Biology. These questions will be tested in a pair of new courses taught by the PI and then will be posted online at the Compadre website, providing a valuable resource to the teaching community that is currently unavailable. The PI will actively involve members of his research group in these teaching activities, thus encouraging the next generation of teacherscholars to use techniques from education research."
0.07995,"The goal of this project is to provide a detailed verifiable explanation of the origin of the heating of the solar atmosphere. Most of the light reaching Earth originates at the 'surface' of the sun, a region called the photosphere. However, the regions of the solar atmosphere immediately above this surface, the solar chromosphere and corona, create most of the dangerous Ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation. These regions also generate the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that pass the Earth at speeds in excess of 400km/s. Both the rapidly changing radiation and the solar wind create hazards for spacecraft, astronauts, and have a number of important terrestrial impacts. A long-standing mystery has prevented scientists from understanding and accurately modeling the chromosphere and corona. A short distance above the 'surface' of the sun, the solar atmosphere's temperature jumps up by a factor of two to three. The goal of this project is to provide an explanation of the origin of this heating. The project will also provide opportunities to recruit and train student researchers in plasma and solar physics, simulations, and modeling at the Boston University. Many of the Boston University PI's undergraduate research advisees, about half of whom are women, have continued on to graduate school. <br/><br/>This research will examine whether solar plasma flows emerging from the photosphere can transfer sufficient energy into turbulent plasma of the solar atmosphere, which, in turn, will heat the chromosphere sufficiently to explain whether the observed UV spectra originate there. It will also evaluate whether this mechanism can account for chromospheric spectral observations. This requires four linked research tasks: (1) solving for plasma drifts and fields when a convecting neutral gas pushes it across magnetic field lines; (2) analyzing the theory of streaming instabilities applicable to the collisional plasma found there; (3) performing a series of kinetic simulations to explore the nonlinear and thermal properties of the resulting turbulence; and (4) incorporating the resulting electron heating into a radiative transport code in order to evaluate its impact on chromospheric radiance. This research combines several research areas encompassed by the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Science and Engineering."
0.361428,"The focus of our research is to investigate nuclear-hadronic dynamics with a particular emphasis on its relation to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of quarks and gluons. Of particular interest is studying the role of chiral symmetry, which is one of the basic symmetries of QCD. The effective field theory named chiral perturbation theory offers a systematic and practical framework to translate the symmetries of QCD into those of hadrons, particles that actually constitute atomic nuclei. The proposed research makes extensive use of this formalism. To describe those phenomena that are at present beyond the applicability of chiral perturbation theory, models are used that approximately reflect the symmetries of QCD and that can be applied to complex nuclei. Specifically, it is proposed to study: eonsequences of nuclear chiral perturbation theory as applied to few-nucleon systems; effective-field-theoretical estimation of radiative corrections for weak processes in few-nucleon systems and systematic improvements of the existing theoretical treatments of the muon-deuteron capture reaction and neutrino-deuteron reactions; nuclear chiral perturbation theory applied to inelastic reactions involving rather high energy-momentum transfers; and neutrino-deuteron reactions beyond the pion-production threshold. <br/><br/>The effective field theory approach is known to be highly useful in our attempt to relate the properties of atomic nuclei to the underlying dynamics of the quarks and gluons. Our investigations not only deepen the understanding of nuclear-hadron physics but also have important bearing upon nuclear astrophysics and search for physics beyond the standard model. Our study has particularly close connections with the on-going and future neutrino experiments that are meant to look for signals for non-standard physics. The budget allows us to hire a post-doctoral fellow and an undergraduate student to join our research effort."
1.425,"The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) began full-scale operations in September 2007 and completed a telescope upgrade in the summer of 2012. This award funds ongoing maintenance and operation of both the telescopes and the array facility over a 3-year period. VERITAS seeks to both identify new sources of Very High Energy (VHE: E >100 Gigaelectron-volt) gamma rays, and to perform in-depth studies of the known sources to better understand their underlying fundamental processes. The primary targets of VERITAS Galactic observations are supernova remnants, pulsars, binary systems, and known VHE sources whose classification is currently unknown. The extragalactic targets observed by VERITAS include active galactic nuclei, radio galaxies, starburst galaxies, galaxy clusters and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, Local Group galaxies, dwarf galaxies and globular clusters are targets of VERITAS observations focused on the indirect detection of cold dark matter. VERITAS is currently the most-sensitive VHE gamma-ray observatory in the world. After 6-years of operation, the experiment is well-understood and promised performance metrics of the experiment (e.g. total data yield and data quality) are achieved or surpassed. Continued operations of VERITAS for this funding cycle are expected to result in new gamma-ray science. <br/><br/>Broader Impact and Outreach: The VERITAS collaboration is involved in public engagement as an important element of its research program. The Adler Planetarium and the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Visitors Center at the VERITAS site coordinate activities, websites and public displays to promote VERITAS science to the public, other educators, museum professionals and the wider community. VERITAS scientists provide education and public outreach experiences in the form of multimedia products, public presentations and activities such as classroom visits, an annual public lecture series, ""star parties"" at the observatory, and tours of the experiment."
0.199017,"This collaborative research project, consisting of four institutions (Rice, Yale, UIUC and Princeton) aims to continue the Physics of Living Systems Student Research Network (PoLS SRN). This network has been in existence for four years and has had a dramatic impact on many graduate students, both in the US and abroad, working on the application of physical science techniques to living systems. These students now can participate in a global community that can help deal with the many complex issues involved in conducting research in such a new and inherently multidisciplinary field. These issues range from proper training, to gaining a broad perspective, to accessing technical expertise that may not be available at their home institution. In addition to the obvious broader impacts related to training of a research workforce, there are other broad impacts of this plan. Via the interaction of one of the PoLS nodes (Rice) with the biomedical community in Houston, students and faculty will be exposed to possible avenues whereby physics can contribute to human health issues. Funds to attract students from under-represented groups to network meetings will be available through the new funds administered by the newly proposed network coordinator. Also deas vetted by the PoLS SRN will be adapted to create student networks in other areas of science and engineering.<br/><br/>There is by now little disagreement with the general notion that concepts and methods from physics have been a critical contributor to the increased understanding of the living world, and that its importance will be growing as the scientific world moves toward an ever more quantitative and predictive form of biology. Thus, the physics community clearly needs to train a new generation of scientists who can lead this effort, scientists who have the right mix of physics/mathematics rigor and broad knowledge of living systems from molecular scales on up. The PoLS SRN aims at creating a community of graduate students who can collectively help themselves and their mentors accelerate and enhance this training process. This is being done by a mix of in-person and virtual modes of communication, and this proposal is a plan to continue and expand these efforts; it will reach more students, improve the social networking portals, and make use of the complementary research agendas of the different network nodes to provide broad technical expertise. Doing all of this, will boost the intellectual level of the entire research field and convince the best students that the Physics of Living Systems is truly the most exciting research frontier in 21st century science.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics, the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry, and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems."
0.15,"The purpose of this project is to enhance knowledge of how disorder affects the electronic solids, such as metals, insulators, and superconductors, that form the basis of modern technology. The ability to control how electrons carry heat, energy, and information in solids enables applications such as computers and efficient energy generation and transmission. The disorder and imperfections inherent in solids are often deleterious and can, for example, increase the resistance of metals to electrical current flow. On the other hand, disorder may enhance superconductivity, which is transmitting electrical current without resistance, and thermoelectricity, which is transforming heat into electrical energy. In general, how disorder affects many exotic solids, such as high-temperature superconductors, that may lead to new applications and higher efficiencies is not understood. In part, this lack of understanding arises because the simplest models of how electrons behave in these materials cannot be solved using even the most powerful supercomputers that will be created over the next century. This project will use atoms trapped in a crystal of light and cooled to just a billionth of a degree above absolute zero temperature to simulate these models in an experiment. The ability of disorder to transform solids between metallic, insulating, and superconducting states will be investigated by measuring how the atoms respond to changes in the light and magnetic fields. The possibility to use disorder as a new tool to suppress processes that disrupt applications such as information storage will be explored. These measurements will be employed to test theories that may be used to design novel materials.<br/><br/>The influence of disorder on the behavior of strongly correlated electronic solids, such as high-temperature superconductors, is poorly understood, despite the prevalence of imperfections in these materials. Numerical simulations provide limited insight, and theory has been challenged to develop controlled approaches to understanding the interplay of strong interactions and disorder. Furthermore, using measurements on materials to test theory and simulations is complicated by the inability to separately control material parameters, imprecise knowledge of disorder, and complications such as phonon-electron scattering. Ultracold K-40 and Rb-87 atoms trapped in optical lattices will be used to explore the impact of disorder on superfluids in Hubbard models, which are minimal models of strongly correlated electronic solids. In these experiments, controllable and precisely characterized disorder will be introduced using optical speckle. The interactions will be manipulated independently by tuning the optical lattice potential depth and via a Feshbach resonance. The disordered attractive Fermi-Hubbard model will be realized for the first time using atoms by tuning to the attractive side of a Feshbach resonance. Combinations of transport and pair fraction measurements will be employed to answer the long-standing question of how fermionic superfluids localize in strongly correlated systems, i.e., whether pairs or single particles constitute the disorder-induced insulating state. Rethermalization and relaxation in localized superfluids (i.e., Bose-glasses) will be probed by measurements of quasimomentum and density profiles. The atomic momentum distribution will be disturbed from equilibrium using quasi-momentum-selective stimulated Raman transitions, and the density profile will be manipulated using a local, repulsive optical potential created by a focused blue-detuned laser beam. Measurements will be compared with state-of-the-art theory and numerical simulations."
0.092457,"This project explores the use of an atomic barium ensemble as a scalable source of pure ultrashort single photons and the creation, preservation and detection of various types of entanglement between distant photons, atomic ensembles and combinations of both. By applying an off-resonant ultrashort laser pulse to warm atomic barium vapor, we generate a collective excitation in the atomic ensemble, called a spin wave, together with a quantum of electromagnetic excitation, i.e. a photon. The detection of the photon signals a successful event and the presence of the spin wave in the matter. This long-lived collective excitation can be converted into an ultrashort single photon in a pure wave-packet at a later desired time by applying another ultrashort pulse. By combining numerous atomic ensembles, we are able to create multiple pure ultrashort and identical photons synchronously, an essential requirement for high bit-rate quantum computation and communication applications. The broad bandwidth of the involved fields permits us to study the spectral properties of nonclassical correlations between the created photon and the atomic excitation, adding to our understanding and ability to control the properties of light-matter interaction at the quantum level.<br/><br/>The work of this project provides and demonstrates a method to generate photons suitable for high-speed quantum communication and computation operations, such as entanglement swapping and Bell state measurements. These applications are essential components of protocols such as quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and Bell inequality detection. Through this project graduate and undergraduate students are trained in experimental and theoretical ultrafast quantum optics and atomic physics. The project serves as the basis for an undergraduate tutorial at the University of Delaware to motivate and improve student understanding of quantum mechanics."
0.228,"The nature of high performance computing is undergoing rapid change with the advent of general purpose GPU-accelerated architectures. These changes open new opportunities for scientific discovery at a much reduced capital and energy cost, but to exploit them, new algorithms and methods are required. <br/><br/>This project supports the collaborative development and implementation of GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) codes and innovative algorithms for the numerical simulation of the strong interactions of quarks and gluons, namely quantum chromodynamics (QCD), on a lattice. Specifically, this project supports the development of CUDA (parallel coding model from NVIDIA)-based code modules and OpenMP threading that can be used with the MILC [Multiple Instruction (and Multiple Data) Lattice Calculation] code. This 200,000-line code suite is used by several research groups around the world and supports some 100 million core-hours of computing at NSF and DOE national centers and laboratories mostly on conventional supercomputers. Our code development will allow improved performance on GPU clusters and on computers such as Blue Waters at NCSA that contain both GPUs and conventional multicore processors. Performance models developed will guide the performance tuning and help to plan future calculations and should also be of value in studing the effectiveness of exascale architectures. <br/><br/>Interpretation of many of the experimental results in particle physics is currently limited by lack of theoretical understanding. This reduces our ability to determine parameters of the Standard Model and to find evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model through precision experiments. The calculations that are enabled are thus important for the interpretation of many experiments in elementary particle physics. Some of these experiments at Fermilab, Cornell, and at SLAC have been completed. Others such as in Beijing, Geneva, and Japan are still running. <br/><br/>We have publicized previous work on code development and performance modeling by presentations at appropriate conference and publication. We will continue to do so for the current work in order that others can benefit from our methodology and innovations. The MILC code is widely used in benchmarking by several high-performance computing centers. This in turn has led to several vendors contacting us regarding performance of our code on their current and future chips. Thus, having GPU-accelerated code available in MILC could help in the evaluation of or co-design of future high-performance computing architectures. <br/><br/>Finally this project will contribute to the professional education and training of future scientists via the participation of postdoctoral reseachers."
0.310216,"This project will investigate the physical properties of living tissue that are important in determining the tissue curvature. The PI will quantitatively determining the number and location of defects in ordered tissues and will develop a mechanical theory of the defect distribution that can be compared with experiment. This constitutes the first quantitative study of tissue curvature as a determining factor of structural organization. Understanding of the morphology and morphogenesis of organisms has grown tremendously based on recent advances in biological and genetic research. Yet, few attempts have been undertaken to describe the development and structure of organs or tissues through quantitative mechanics. The results of this work will be equally applicable to all curved tissue layers that show a degree of order, including cancer cell acini, whose morphology is important for the development of cancer, as well as developing embryos in the morula and blastula stages. As curvature induces constraints on the degree of order, it may play a role in symmetry breaking and polarization, and thus in the earliest patterning of the embryo. Describing a direct influence of mechanical forces on cell development will be a fundamental advance towards a better understanding of morphogenesis and tissue formation in the context of both diagnostics and therapy, e.g. tissue regeneration or cancer. Data acquisition will employ the help of undergraduate students as well as outreach to high school students through the existing Bugscope project at Illinois, thus connecting with the broader public through a visually fascinating and interdisciplinary project.<br/><br/>This project focuses on insect eyes as a concrete example of an ordered tissue structure, because of the extreme regularity of the compound eye, the large number of individual eyes (ommatidia) in the compound eye, and the relative ease with which the structure can be quantitatively analyzed. Using both SEM imaging and confocal microscopy, the goals are to (i) determine the complete microstructure of the ommatidia and (ii) determine the macrostructure (global shape and curvature) of the eye, in order to (iii) compare the number and position of ommatidial defects with those predicted by the mechanical theory of curved patterned surfaces. The existing theory of defect placement on curved surfaces (developed for a limited number of examples from solid state physics) will be adapted to the more general shapes encountered in insect eyes. Both numerical simulations and analytical theory will be developed. While Drosophila wild-type and mutant eyes in mature and pupal stages will be the main focus, the variety of insect eye sizes and shapes in different species is an asset to this study."
0.105,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Brian Fields at the University of Illinois and Professor Lloyd Knox at the University of California Davis.<br/><br/>The theory of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest elements--hydrogen, helium, and lithium--in the first seconds of the big bang. BBN predictions for cosmic light-element abundances are in broad agreement with observations; this concordance is a major success of the hot big bang model. Moreover, BBN provides a measure of the ordinary matter (""baryon"") content of the universe, as well as total content in relativistic particles (""radiation"") in both visible and invisible form (e.g., neutrinos and any other forms of ""dark light""). In the past decade, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has emerged as a precise and independent measure of cosmic baryons. Comparing BBN and CMB baryon measures thus has provided a new fundamental test of the hot big bang cosmology, and reveal a ""lithium problem."" This BBN/CMB connection is now poised to open qualitatively new possibilities. Recent and upcoming measurements of the CMB for the first time will simultaneously probe not only cosmic baryons, but also cosmic radiation as well as the helium abundance itself. This will enable powerful new tests of cosmology: for the first time, the predictions of BBN can be tested entirely with very precise CMB data. Agreement would dramatically demonstrate the consistency of the standard cosmology, while any difference probes new physics. Professors Fields and Knox will both evaluate and interpret the BBN-CMB comparison, develop tools to efficiently and accurately compare BBN and CMB data. For the first time, a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach will be used to evaluate BBN uncertainties; this will allow a direct and consistent means of combining BBN predictions and CMB data and statistically characterizing the results. As part of this analysis, a new open-source BBN code will be produced, tested, and publicly released.<br/><br/>It is expected that this work will have substantial broader impacts. A publicly available open source BBN code will be released. Moreover, new and strong links will be forged among the CMB and early-universe particle astrophysics communities, and more widely among the particle astrophysics, cosmology, and astronomy communities. Graduate students, both in formal courses in research mentoring, will be trained to synthesize these approaches and to work in an interdisciplinary way. In addition, Profs. Fields will maintain vigorous, sustained outreach programs which include school visits and public lectures bringing this forefront science to a wider audience."
0.472302,"This project is jointly funded by the following programs in the Divisions of Physics (PHY) and Chemistry (CHE) of the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS), and the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) of the Directorate for Social and Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), with co-funding from the Office of Integrative Activities: MPS/PHY/Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics--Experiment, MPS/PHY/Physics of Living Systems, MPS/CHE/Chemistry of Life Processes, SBE/BCS/Program on Perception, Action, and Cognition and the SBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. This project will test the limits of how living things detect light and study how the laws of quantum mechanics apply to biological systems. Single photons (individual particles of light) will be used to study both the human visual system and light-sensitive bacteria. In the human visual system, this project will determine whether humans can see a single photon (a longstanding question in psychology) by using a method of creating one photon at a time to test the vision of human observers. This project will also investigate what human observers see when they detect a photon in a superposition - a state of being in two places at the same time - which is allowed by quantum mechanics. Light-sensitive bacteria will also be studied using single photons, to understand the limits of light detection and the possible effects of quantum laws in a different biological system. In addition to advancing our knowledge of how living things detect and use light, this research might help us understand why particles such as photons show strange quantum behavior such as superposition, while the familiar world around us behaves differently. Making quantum effects available to human perception would also have broad popular appeal, and could be a gateway for students and the public to learn about quantum physics.<br/><br/>To produce single photons, this project will use a well-known heralded single-photon source design based on spontaneous parametric downconversion. Single photons at 505 nm and 440 nm will be used for experiments with humans and E. coli, respectively. To determine whether humans can see single photons, observers will complete a series of trials in which they must choose whether the stimulus photon appeared on the left or the right side of their visual field. If observers are able to choose left or right with accuracy statistically greater than 50%, this is strong evidence that they can see single photons. An EEG-contingent stimulus delivery method will also be developed to improve the likelihood of detection. If single-photon vision is confirmed, a subsequent experiment will attempt a test of quantum nonlocality with a human observer replacing one single-photon detector. Finally, to test perception of superposition states, observers will be presented with both a classical mixture of photons at the left and right spots, and photons in a superposition of left and right. The observer's frequency of choosing left and right will be compared between the two cases, with any unexpected difference suggesting a deviation from standard quantum mechanics. To study phototactic bacteria (which move in response to light), individual E. coli cells will be immobilized in an IR optical trap and stimulated with single photons. In an established technique, the response of the cells can be measured by tracking their swimming and tumbling behavior with the trapping beam. Other species will be studied in following experiments, including photosynthetic Rhodobacter sphaeroides."
0.48,"This project continues an interdisciplinary program to develop fundamental theories of many-particle systems, ranging from ultradense nuclear matter in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and in neutron stars to ultracold atomic and condensed matter systems. Nuclear theory will be applied to study the properties of matter formed under extreme conditions of temperatures and pressures, to matter in neutron stars, with the aim of understanding observations and experiment and, conversely, using observations of neutron stars to learn properties of matter under extreme conditions. This research makes important interdisciplinary connections between nuclear and QCD problems and cold atom systems and will apply expertise in quantum fluids to predict the behavior of dilute helium solutions used in the proposed experiment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Spallation Neutron Source to detect the electric dipole moment of the neutron.<br/><br/>Understanding new states of matter and connections between them provides broad intellectual insights into the basic properties of matter ranging from the hottest to the coldest many-particle systems in the universe. By integrating students and post-doctoral fellows into a diverse program that crosses the traditional boundaries between nuclear, particle, condensed matter and atomic physics, the PI and his colleagues provide unique opportunities for young researchers to think and create across disciplines. The scientists trained in this program have generally gone on to have significant impact in research at U.S. universities and national laboratories, as well as abroad."
0.334232,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Tim Stelzer at the University of Illinois. <br/><br/>After nearly 20 years of planning and construction, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is now the highest-energy particle collider in the world. Data from the LHC is likely to lead to nothing less than a new ""Standard Model"" for the next generation of particle physicists, describing the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at an even higher energy scale. In his research, Professor Stelzer aims to develop methods to improve the efficiency by which new theories beyond the Standard Model might be tested at the LHC. This class of new theories includes those in which the symmetries of the Standard Model are augmented by a so-called ""supersymmetry"" relating particles of different spins to each other. Typically, once a new theory has been identified as interesting, it may take a team of researchers a year or more to complete the calculations necessary to determine how this theory could be tested at the LHC. Methods developed and implemented by this award aim to reduce that time from years to days, dramatically increasing the range of new physics that can be studied as the LHC data is collected.<br/><br/>This project will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Stelzer will involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field. He also intends to give public lectures on his research results, and develop new learning materials for undergraduate students based on results from the LHC."

The network structure will allow students at participating institutions (and a select number of other students) to meet their peers (both in-person and in-silico) and collectively help define the research agenda for this field. It will also allow for the creation of visiting internships, which will serve both as a way of broadening students perspectives on possible approaches to difficult research topics and as a way of creating collaborative ties between groups at the various sites. This structure will also enable the exploration of various means of educating these students in biology, while also ensuring that they develop and maintain a firm grounding in physics.

0.6,"Funding for the three-year project to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) supports the research in general relativity and theoretical astrophysics of the PI, Professor Stuart L. Shapiro. In addition to the PI, the funding supports one postdoctoral research associate and two undergraduate (REU) students to assist in the research. The intellectual scope of this research program spans several problems involving general relativity, the generation of gravitational radiation, relativistic hydrodynamics, and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. A common thread uniting the different theoretical topics is the crucial role of gravitation, especially relativistic gravitation. Compact objects provide the principal forum, and the dynamics of matter in a strong gravitational field is a major theme. Some of the topics for investigation include the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries (binary black holes, binary neutron stars, binary black hole--neutron stars and binary white dwarf--neutron stars), the generation of gravitational waves from binaries and other promising astrophysical sources and the accompanying electromagnetic signals, gravitational collapse, the stability of rotating, relativistic stars and the evolution and final fate of unstable stars, gamma-ray burst sources, and circumbinary disks around merging supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies and quasars. Most of these topics represent long-standing, fundamental problems in theoretical physics requiring large-scale computation for solution. Hence the approach involves to a significant degree large-scale computations on parallel machines, as well as analytical modeling. Many of the numerical calculations employ the state-of-the-art computational and visualization resources of the UIUC's National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). They comprise both initial value and evolution computations and treat vacuum spacetimes containing black holes as well as spacetimes containing realistic matter sources, magnetic fields and both electromagnetic and neutrino radiation. The results have important implications for astronomical observations, including those planned for gravitational wave interferometers, such as the Advanced LIGO/VIRGO network, GEO, KAGRA and eLISA/NGO.<br/><br/>This project has broader impacts beyond the solutions to the specific research problems that it tackles. The planned research bridges the fields of general relativity and astrophysics. It provides the main funding for research in general relativity at UIUC and a significant component of the total support in theoretical astrophysics to that institution. An appreciable portion of the funding is devoted to the education, training and support of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. These students collaborate with the PI on the majority of research topics funded by the project. The grant supports the activities of the PI's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) team at UIUC in computational astrophysics and general relativity theory. The training that each of the PI's undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students receives in large-scale computations and scientific visualization, as well as in several different areas of theoretical physics and astrophysics, prepares them to pursue professional careers in a broad range of scientific and technical fields. The computer algorithms and numerical codes that are developed are useful to other groups working in computational physics and astrophysics. Through the research and outreach activities of the PI and his group, the grant helps promote the use of computers and visualization tools at all levels of education, as well as the public awareness of some the latest and most exciting developments in gravitation physics and astrophysics."
0.5,"In this project, the PIs will investigate the consequences of recent observations that the dynamics of the cell scaffolding is wavelike in many biological processes - from amoeboid chemotaxis to development. The PI's goal is to elucidate how this wave-like characteristic of the motility machinery affects navigation of cells in complex environments, and collective behavior of cell groups. The PIs will use D. discoideum as a model organism that exhibits both individual and collective cell migration behavior, and that exhibits wave-like protrusive activity even when cells are suspended without any surface contact. The specific goals are: 1. Wave-surface coupling: The PIs will analyze how waves interact with surfaces to generate forces and motion using micro-fabricated local adhesion patches and lines. The aim is to understand how patterns of adhesivity may direct migration and to integrate this insight into stochastic simulations of collective cell migration. 2. Cell-cell coupling: The PIs will measure how waves propagate through groups of cells that are in contact and integrate this finding in simulations. The aim is to elucidate mechanical aspects of cell-cell signaling and group migration. 3. Triggering waves and resonances: the PIs will use the strengths of their team in nonlinear dynamics, microfabrication, and quantitative studies of amoeboid cell migration, to achieve these goals. The PIs will carry out the proposed work through the combination of expertise in controlled 3D microfabrication and surface functionalization of local adhesion patches, systematic shape dynamics quantification, and stochastic modeling of collective dynamics. To make their findings broadly accessible, the PIs will also develop a series of videos for YouTube that will highlight wavelike cell migration and cell-cell communication as a jumping point to introduce different scientific topics at a level that is suitable for the general public. The PI will train women and underrepresented minorities in this research program. All students will receive highly interdisciplinary training involving elements of biophysics and materials science."
1.32,"This award funds the research activities of Professors David Gross, Joseph Polchinski, Mark Srednicki, Robert Sugar, and Anthony Zee at the University of California at Santa Barbara.<br/><br/>This award will support research aimed at understanding the basic building blocks of matter and the fundamental laws underlying nature by a variety of approaches: theoretical, computational, and by building models of the properties of elementary particles. Gross and Polchinski are largely focused on the construction of a unified theory of gravity and the particle interactions, based on string theory and related ideas. Particular approaches are the study of the quantum mechanical properties of black holes, the emergence of space-time from a more fundamental theory, and the understanding of higher symmetries that appear in these theories. Sugar studies the properties of the strong nuclear interaction using large-scale computation, directed at testing the existing Standard Model of particle properties and the search for new physics. Srednicki and Zee study models of known and new particles, including neutrinos, supersymmetric particles, and dark matter. These are all areas where a host of experiments will continue to report new results, from the LHC and Fermilab to a variety of deep-mine and space-based observations. The members of the group are broad in their interests and work on other areas as well, including nonequilibrium dynamics, quantum chaos and its connections with mathematics and physics, new methods and applications in quantum field theory (the basic mathematical framework for quantum physics), and the understanding of the cosmological constant, which drives the accelerating expansion of the universe.<br/><br/>The training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows is a major activity of this grant. The broad range of research topics covered by this award, and the strong scientific base at UCSB and the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, provide an excellent environment for the education of young scientists. The PIs are also active in communicating science to the public, through lectures, writings, and interactions with the scientific press and the media, and several have written widely used textbooks. Part of the effort in lattice gauge theory is aimed at developing large-scale computational infrastructure for the entire U.S. lattice gauge theory community. The approach being taken has broad possibilities for application to computationally-intensive problems in many areas of science and engineering."
1.010538,"In pursuit of improving our understanding of the universe by studying the constituents of dark matter, the research objective of this award is to increase the current detection sensitivity of dark matter-nucleon scattering by a factor of about 100 in order to measure the cross-section between Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and nucleons or to severely restrict theoretically favorable parameter space. <br/><br/>In order to achieve this objective, the SuperCDMS experiment must maintain a background environment of less than one event. This group will advance analysis techniques to discriminate electromagnetic backgrounds from dark matter signals using the new interleaved Z-sensitive Ionization and Phonon (iZIP) detectors which are scheduled to be deployed at Soudan. In addition, they are performing calculations and developing simulations to estimate the irreducible internal background from alpha-n and fission interactions in materials immediately surrounding the SuperCDMS detectors. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The award will also fund an outreach program that will increase the public's appreciation for science. In pursuit of this goal, the educational objective is to use SuperCDMS to support secondary teachers through the QuarkNet program and create research opportunities for undergraduates at SMU. Students and postdoctoral scholars working on this project will receive strong scientific and educational preparation in the techniques of low temperature physics, high energy physics and astrophysics and the analysis of data."
1.820663,"This is an exciting time in our quest to understand neutrinos -- fundamental particles that play key roles in the early universe, in cosmology and astrophysics, and in nuclear and particle physics. Results from neutrino oscillation experiments have provided compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass and give the first indication that the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics is incomplete. With the realization that neutrinos are massive, there is an increased interest in investigating their intrinsic properties. Understanding the neutrino mass generation mechanism, the neutrino character (Majorana or Dirac), the absolute neutrino mass scale, and the neutrino mass spectrum are some of the main focuses of the immediate future's neutrino experiments. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that a sensitive search for the neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, which is an important symmetry in elementary particle physics. With the goal of ultimately realizing a 1-tonne scale neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay experiment using Germanium (Ge) detectors, the Majorana collaboration is assembling a prototype referred to as the Demonstrator that is intended to confirm that background levels low enough to justify such a large experiment can be reached. The baseline plan for the Demonstrator is for 15 kg of Ge detectors fabricated from Ge enriched in the double-beta isotope 76-Ge. Because most of the cost of such an experiment is the apparatus associated with it and not enriched Ge, and because one can increase the mass of instrumented 76-Ge significantly without increasing that base cost, there is the opportunity to ""increase"" the physics reach of the project for a reasonable, incremental additional cost. This award provides support for extra Ge detectors fabricated from enriched material to improve the physics reach.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The technology of larger, lower-background HPGe arrays developed from a tonne-scale experiment can be expected to enable a new generation of highly efficient, ultra-low-background gamma spectroscopy measurements. Among the fields that stand to benefit from this new generation of technology are: direct dark matter searches; measurements for environmental monitoring; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities. An E&O program with the Morehead Planetarium on the campus of U. of North Carolina will bring underground science to the public."
1.05,"This award funds the research activities of Professors K. Becker, M. Becker, and E. Sezgin at Texas A&M University. <br/><br/>This research project addresses fundamental aspects of string theory and also explores connections to other areas of physics such as high temperature superconductivity. The first set of projects deals with string perturbation theory and the construction of D-brane effective actions. The results of such work could also be used to check the consistency of models of particle physics obtained from string theory. Another topic to be investigated concerns the application of string theory to condensed matter physics, specifically high temperature superconductivity. Other topics to be investigated include conformal field theories beyond two dimensions, as well as the development of remarkable higher-spin extensions of Einstein gravity and their holographic descriptions. <br/><br/>The research described in this proposal is envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Beyond the interdisciplinary nature of this research, stretching from high-energy physics to condensed-matter physics, these impacts also include the training of graduate students working towards their Ph.D.'s and the training and mentoring of postdoctoral fellows who will be directly involved with the research funded under this award."
11.4,"The Institute for Quantum Information and Matter (IQIM) is a center-level activity that spans Quantum Information Science (QIS), Condensed Matter Physics (CMP), Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (AMOP), and the emerging field of Mechanical Quantum Systems (MQS). The unifying theme for the IQIM is the exploration of collective quantum phenomena that endow physical systems of many interacting constituents with astonishing properties that in effect transform the weirdness of the microscopic quantum realm to macroscopic scales. The principal motivations for the creation of the IQIM are the extraordinary set of scientific opportunities associated with the study of exotic quantum states of matter and the potential for discovery brought by newly developed tools from Quantum Information Science. The IQIM ties together the diverse Caltech community of researchers, from physics to applied physics, to computer science, who focus on emergent quantum phenomena and provides a sustaining base for the scientific development of a new field of research that will actively involve national and international communities of researchers in QIS, CMP, AMOP, and MQS. By way of extensive programs in education and outreach, the IQIM will impact high school and college education and will engage the general public with the ""mind boggling"" nature of the quantum realm.<br/><br/>It has long been known that individual atoms and electrons, as well as electromagnetic and mechanical oscillators (i.e., photons and phonons), obey laws of quantum physics that in many respects defy common sense. Under the right conditions, interactions among many such quantum objects can lead to remarkable quantum phenomena that have heretofore not existed in nature. Advances to create, characterize, and utilize such exotic quantum phenomena have been made in condensed matter physics (CMP), atomic-molecular-optical physics (AMOP), and at the interface between these areas. In conjunction with parallel developments in quantum information science (QIS), a revolution is underway in the study of exotic quantum systems that is the unifying theme and driving motivation for the IQIM. Progress in the experimental realization and theoretical understanding in this area will surely have profound implications for basic physics. The IQIM will merge insights and analytic tools from QIS with advancing laboratory capabilities in CMP, AMOP, and MQS for the discovery and characterization of exotic quantum states of matter, and will thereby shed light on issues at the core of physics. Eventually, the ability to manipulate exotic quantum systems may lead to new technological capabilities, including methods for designing and exploiting quantum materials.<br/><br/>The Institute for Quantum Information and Matter will have the following scientific thrusts:<br/><br/>Quantum Information: Investigators at the current NSF-sponsored Institute for Quantum Information (IQI) have made Caltech a recognized world leader in theoretical QIS. IQI faculty are integral members of the IQIM and conduct research that is closely allied to the IQIM, e.g., the application of topological principles to quantum phase transitions and the discovery of universal features of entanglement that that distinguish quantum phases of matter. Research at the IQIM includes investigations of the connections between quantum information science and other aspects of basic physics. IQI scientists will lead the quest to apply insights into the properties of quantum entanglement for the study of quantum many-body systems and quantum phase transitions, as well as to apply quantum information theory to illuminate how information is encoded in spacetimes subject to strong quantum fluctuations. The IQI will also continue its world leading programs on quantum computation and communication.<br/><br/>Quantum Many-Body Physics: Caltech has world leading programs in the quantum physics of strongly interacting many-body systems (e.g., superconductors, exotic magnets, strongly correlated electron systems, etc.). Research thrusts in this area will emphasize emergent quantum phenomena, including quantum Hall physics, topological states of matter, exotic magnetic systems, and ultra-cold atomic gases, and with strong connections to powerful theoretical techniques from QIS. These studies will involve some of the most fascinating and puzzling manifestations of many-body quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>Quantum Optics: Another area of great strength at Caltech is the study of optical interactions at the level of one atom and photon, where seminal advances in the realization of new paradigms for light-matter interactions by way of micro- and nano-scopic optical cavities have been made. Within IQIM, existing capabilities for quantum control of strong interactions of single atoms and photons will be extended to explore quantum many-body systems composed of 1- and 2-D arrays of atoms whose interactions are mediated by photons in microscopic quantum optical circuits.<br/><br/>Quantum Mechanics of Mechanical Systems: Faculty in the IQIM in will build upon recent advances in opto- and electro-mechanics 1) to achieve quantum control of single phonons in simple material systems, thereby enabling lithographic fabrication of quantum many-body systems with phonon mediated interactions, and 2) to create human-sized objects in entangled quantum states within the setting of LIGO.<br/><br/>The IQIM has many facets beyond fundamental research to explore exotic quantum states of matter and the interface with QIS. With the end of scalability of conventional silicon-based information technology on the horizon, it is vitally important to explore aggressively new paradigms for information technology. By attracting and training top students and postdoctoral scholars in QIS, CMP, AMOP, and MQS, the IQIM will significantly strengthen the US presence in these areas and will broaden the nation's technical base. A particularly important aspect of the IQIM?s broader impact is a vibrant visitor program, which fuels intellectual excitement, facilitates collaborations and exchanges of scientific ideas, and performs a highly valued service for national and international communities at the interfaces of QIS, CMP, AMOP, and MQS. <br/><br/>The IQIM will also undertake extensive programs for outreach and the development of human resources. The goal is to use the public's fascination with the mysteries of the quantum realm to engage a broad community in basic science and education. Activities include the following:<br/>The Caltech Precollege Science Initiative (CAPSI )- In collaboration with CAPSI, IQIM will develop high school curricula for one to two week instructional modules related to the scientific activities of the Institute, <br/>Summer internships for high school teachers and students from multiethnic LA regional high schools,<br/>Caltech MURF program for undergraduate research experience of minority students in IQIM laboratories,<br/>Disseminating science via a science and entertainment partnership in collaboration with The Science and Entertainment Exchange (SEE),<br/>Development of university curricula related to IQIM fields of research,<br/>Public presentations via the Caltech Watson Lectures and YouTube videos.<br/><br/>These activities will be accessible via an interactive IQIM website.<br/><br/>Funding is provided by the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering."
0.09,"A major benefit to undergraduate students pursuing careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines, is the opportunity to experience first-hand the application of technology and scientific techniques in real world settings. This project is part of a research program that studies heavy ion collisions within A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The primary goal is to provide students with research experiences that stimulate an interest in science and technology, exposes them to techniques used in experimental high energy physics, allows the development of global relationships and prepares them for careers in science and technology. The project on which the students will work has a focus centered on understanding the behavior of extremely dense matter, similar to that existing a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. This is achieved by colliding atomic nuclei at very high energies and studying the remnants of these collisions using highly sophisticated detectors. The students involved in this project will analyze the resulting sub-atomic particles generated by these collisions, and will contribute to the design of new detectors that will enable even more sensitive experiments in the future.<br/><br/>As stated earlier, the focus of ALICE at CERN is to understand the behavior of matter at very high density, similar to the matter that existed a fraction a second after the Big Bang. This state of matter, consisting of a very hot and dense medium of quarks and gluons, is often referred to as a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). By colliding nuclei at very high energies it is possible to create a QGP in a controlled environment that facilitates the study of its properties. Chicago State University (CSU) students will investigate the flavor characteristics, specifically strangeness, of jets resulting from high-energy proton-proton and lead-lead collisions and their use as probes in the study of QGP formation. In addition, CSU students will be involved in a research and development program devoted to the upgrade of ALICE sub-detectors, thereby participating in the hardware development of important components in the ALICE experiment.<br/><br/>Collaboration with a large international laboratory such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN allows students to work with world-class scientists and ""state of the art"" technology, thus preparing them for STEM careers. Additionally, a program such as this has the potential of creating a cadre of students who become ambassadors for STEM; students who demonstrate to their peers the benefits of pursuing careers in science, engineering, math and technology. Also, students who participate in this program may serve as mentors and role models for students of high school age and younger, thereby, contributing to the creation of a pipeline of students actively preparing for careers in STEM."
0.514945,"This proposal addresses the fundamental puzzle of how Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) breaches the protective mucus barrier to reach the epithelial cell surface and colonize in the extreme acidic environment of the stomach. The studies proposed here will advance the fundamental physics underlying bacterial motion and aggregation in a viscoelastic gel, and elucidate the influence of shape on motility and colonization. Chemotactic measurements of bacteria moving in microfluidic devices with multiple chemical gradients across mucin/mucus layers on gastric cells will contribute to the development of a useful ex vivo, biomimetic model.<br/><br/>Many bacteria, like those in the gastrointestinal tract, have to negotiate mucosal barriers to establish colonies. In particular, Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium that causes ulcers, gastritis and gastric cancer faces the additional challenge of overcoming the acidic environment. Previous work from the PI's group established that H. pylori uses the same biochemical strategy of urea hydrolysis to neutralize the acid and elevate the pH for both survival in the stomach and to swim across by triggering a gel-solution transition. Recent studies with mutants having cell shape alterations have shown that the helical shape is advantageous in establishing colonies in agar gels. Preliminary bacteria tracking microscopy and resistive force theory based modeling show that the distribution of swimming speeds is due to polydispersity of shape and size, along with a biphasic temporal variation of speed, and that the helical shape provides added propulsion in a viscous mucin solution leading to a faster swimming speed. Innovative imaging techniques will be used to investigate bacterial motility and the changes that the bacterium causes in the host gel by quantitative measurements of pH changes and alterations in local micro-rheology of its environment. The rheological studies of bacteria infected gels will be characterized using oscillatory shear rheology. Microfluidic geometries will be designed to mimic the gastric mucus environment under ex-vivo conditions, layering substrates with epithelial cells covered with mucus or purified mucin or gelatin or agar and establish pH or ionic gradients to examine the bacteria motility and the extent and pattern of colonization. The influence of the bacterium on the surrounding mucus /mucin will be probed by fluorescent dye binding and Atomic Force Microscopy. Comparative studies of the wild-type H. pylori with mutants with altered cell shapes or deficient in specific receptors or flagella, will make it possible to assess the effect of the many variables at play in this complex living system. The experimental studies will be complemented by computational and theoretical modeling of bacterial motility, body and flagella dynamics, chemotaxis, and pattern formation in gels to provide a quantitative understanding of the underlying physics. High school students will participate via the Summer research internship, RISE program at Boston University. Videos on bacterial motility and simple analysis tools will be developed for use in undergraduate courses and for demonstration purposes. The PI will take advantage of the diversity of the team, and the broad appeal of the research topic, to do outreach activities involving presentations to a broader audience, including local high schools, and minority and other community groups and to recruit women and minority graduate, undergraduate and high school students to participate in this research."
16.85,"The primary theme of the JILA PFC is to address the challenge of bridging the gap from few-body physics to many-body physics through quantum control. The central scientific objective is to extend the remarkable level of control and understanding that physicists have for few-body systems to many-body quantum systems. Quantum systems made up of many particles and their interactions play an essential role in much of physics, including condensed matter physics, material physics, nuclear physics, high-energy particle physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and chemical physics. The JILA PFC will focus upon the challenge of controlling and understanding multi-particle quantum systems using the tools and ideas of atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics, which, ironically, is a field of physics for which many-body physics has not traditionally been emphasized. AMO physics is in the midst of a revolution, evidenced, for example, by the remarkable accomplishments in recent years of experiments on ultracold gases, ultrafast laser technology, and ultraprecise spectroscopy. This revolution affords a new approach for confronting the behavior of complex multi-particle systems using control at the quantum level. <br/><br/>In the period 2011- 2016, the JILA PFC investigators will apply the tools of modern AMO physics to tackle the challenge of bridging the gap from few-body to many-body quantum physics from both sides, using cutting-edge techniques to study few-body problems beyond current understanding and many-particle ensembles in regimes beyond the limits of a mean-field description. Specific questions to be addressed are (1) What new insights can one bring to quantum many-body physics using ultracold atom and molecule gases as model systems? (2) Can one extend AMO's measurement and control techniques to create new types of many-body systems using coherent light-matter coupling? (3) Can one understand and address, in the few- to many-body problem, the physics of molecule formation and, more generally, chemical reactions by applying cutting-edge technologies to control and probe simple molecular systems? (4) What are potential high impact research directions that are closely tied to this work? The research will take place at JILA, a multidisciplinary research institute located on the University of Colorado campus in Boulder, and builds upon the extensive results achieved under the present PFC funding. Significant results in nanokelvin molecular physics, in non-classical behavior of nano-oscillators and microwave fields, and in various probes of solid and liquid dynamics across timescales that span twelve orders of magnitude, all set the stage for rapid future progress in four major activities:.<br/><br/>Major Activity 1: Building complex matter from the ground up.<br/><br/>Work in this area will explore the rich phenomena arising in novel quantum many-body systems that are assembled from ultracold atoms and molecules. This major activity, which has strong connections to condensed matter physics, will include research in dipolar molecular quantum gases and strongly interacting atomic quantum gases. Specific research goals include exploring the boundary between gaseous and liquid behavior in gases of strongly interacting particles, and realizing novel states of quantum matter using the long-range and anisotropic interactions between ultracold polar molecules.<br/><br/>Major Activity 2: Engineering quantum many-body systems using light-matter coupling.<br/><br/>This activity will extend quantum control to increasingly complex systems by exploiting coherent light matter interactions. Projects will explore collective light emission from cold atoms, the quantum motion of nano-mechanical oscillators, and light-induced coherence in material systems. An example project is an ambitious effort to map non-classical photon states in the microwave onto corresponding states in optical modes and vice versa, using a nanomechanical ""diving board"" as the coupling medium.<br/><br/>Major Activity 3: Confronting molecular transformation.<br/><br/>At the most basic level, reactions proceed via the interaction between electrons and the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion. JILA PFC investigators will explore the physics of reactions at this fundamental level, with the goal of understanding, and learning to control, energy flow in small systems such as triatomic and tetratomic molecules. They will focus on three projects: studying cold and ultracold reactive molecular scattering, probing time-resolved nuclear and electronic dynamics, and developing coherent UV to IR molecular spectroscopy.<br/><br/>Major Activity 4: Exploring high impact synergistic research directions.<br/><br/>An essential aspect of JILA's center philosophy is that one should be alert to opportunities to ""export"" interesting ideas and technologies to activities outside the central focus of the center, and to import these as well. JILA will explore a few of these opportunities, investing a small fraction of center resources in facilitating this trade in ideas and technology.<br/><br/>The major activities share a common focus, and therefore have substantial intellectual and scientific overlap, and, if, anything, still stronger technological overlap. Prior experience has shown that the extraordinarily challenging goals envisioned for the JILA PFC are best tackled with fluid collaborations that can draw on a range of capabilities, such as laser frequency combs, ultracold atoms, advanced VUV sources, quantum and ultrafast optics, the sensitive detection methods of chemical physics, and theoretical methods, both computational and analytic. This diversity of expertise cannot readily be synthesized in an individual investigator's group. In addition, the JILA PFC relies on and continuously upgrades a shared technical infrastructure including a world-class machine shop, as well as electronics and computational support, and engages in a collective program of education and outreach efforts.<br/><br/>The JILA program will have many different broader impacts. It will enhance the nation's technical infrastructure by developing many new laser-based tools and techniques, and by producing many graduates who are highly trained not only in AMO physics but also in technical communication and teaching skills. It will connect with the science community around the world and foster field-wide frontier research through organization and hosting of topical workshops, through a short-term and long-term JILA visitor program, as well as through the many undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who participate in the collaborative and interdisciplinary research at JILA. As discussed above, the proposed work connects to many different areas of physics, including applied areas such as materials physics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. Extending understanding and quantum control from few- to many-body systems will certainly impact many applications, such as photosynthesis, design of catalytic materials, and new techniques in renewable energy. The proposed program will also attract more students into science, particularly from under-represented groups, through a vigorous undergraduate research program and a predominantly minority-serving middle-school after-school enrichment program. It will contribute to general science interest and literacy through a variety of programs that include the very popular ""Wizards"" show for school children, the University of Colorado Saturday Physics public talks, and suitably trained graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who present science topics to Colorado middle-school and high-school students. It will also research, develop, and broadly disseminate better ways to teach AMO science to all students, better ways to teach AMO science to all students, particularly through on-line interactive simulation."
0.653496,"In this project the PI will design a comprehensive network-based framework that will allow the study of the attractors corresponding to signal transduction networks, and biological networks in general, even in the absence of quantitative information. A set of parsimonious methodologies will be developed that iteratively bridge qualitative and quantitative modeling, specifically graph theoretical analysis as well as Boolean, Boolean-continuous hybrid, and Hill-type continuous dynamic modeling methods. The proposed models allow for a direct interpretation of their results as they represent behaviors such as apoptosis, proliferation, migration, pathogen clearance, as output nodes of the network. The main hypothesis of this work is that the damage due to the cascading effects of a perturbation can be mitigated even if the original perturbation can no longer be reversed. The framework will be used to determine how node perturbations (changes in state or in interactions) change the output nodes dynamic attractors and furthermore to identify those interventions - such as externally supplying or depleting a node, or placing a node under the control of an upstream element - that can restore the normal dynamics of output nodes even in the presence of node perturbations. <br/><br/>Two specific aims will be pursued: (i) to develop a suite of network modeling methods to identify, filter and rank candidate restorative interventions, and (ii) to make these network modeling methods easily usable by a large community. All analysis methods will be implemented in the open-source library BooleanNet, which will feature a web-based interface, a network analysis layer and a visualization layer. The damage mitigation methodologies developed in this project have implications in addressing major societal needs such as sustainable food production, ecosystem restoration, and human health. This project will provide funding and cross-disciplinary training for a graduate student and a postdoctoral scholar, both co-advised by the PI and co-PI. Both investigators have extensive experience in co-advising and in mentoring of female and minority scientists at all levels. The project will provide research opportunities for Penn State undergraduates recruited by various means such as the Physics REU program and the Women in Science and Engineering program. This research will be incorporated into the courses taught by the PIs, including the undergraduate course Systems Biology and Networks and the graduate course Practical Data Analysis for Life Scientists, both attended by students from diverse departments. Groups of under-represented middle school students will be hosted during summer visits to Penn State as part of the Higher Achievement Program, a non-profit, academic support program that prepares students to complete high school and be college-ready. In addition, one member of the team will yearly attend the SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicano and Native American Scientists) conference and participate in conversations with scientists and other activities designed to facilitate entry of minorities into careers in science. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Physiological and Networks and Regulation Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.135257,"Since the early 2000's it has been understood that free electrons in biological environments are able to interact with, and cause damage to, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). This is in spite of the generally slow speeds of these electrons. This finding carried significant implications in various fields of biomedicine, in particular those that employ radiation as a therapeutic measure. This is due to the fact that such radiation creates free electrons within the body, which effectively constitutes a secondary radiation dose. However, to this day the effect of these electrons is largely excluded from most dosage calculations, in part due to the paucity of fundamental data describing how free electrons interact with molecules that make up DNA. Experimental physics techniques to measure electron interaction ""cross sections,"" a quantity that describes the chemistry of a molecule by characterizing its physical size and shape, are well established for many targets. These techniques require molecules to be in the gas phase, however, whereas commercial samples of most biological molecules are solids (powders) at room temperature. While changing a substance from solid to gas is possible by simply heating it, this approach is incompatible with other crucial aspects of most standard experimental techniques. The research supported by this project will commission a new apparatus that will employ new measurement techniques, compatible with heated samples, to make measurements of electron interactions with DNA molecules. Improving our fundamental understanding of electron interactions with biological molecules will allow the effects of radiation on biological material to be more accurately included into radiation dosage calculations, which may ultimately enable the radiation to be better targeted to where it is needed most.<br/><br/>This project will commission a new electron scattering spectrometer for the purpose of making measurements of the total, total elastic, and elastic differential cross sections for the nucleobases, with a view to making measurements of uracil and thymine within the time frame of the current project. Under this project, a beam of electrons is sent through a large volume of a heated gas cell containing a vapor of the target under consideration. The use of a large volume cell, rather than a traditional crossed beam technique, allows for a sufficient number of electron-target interactions to achieve reasonable statistics in the signal, and removes complications with normalizing the measurements since the target volume and density are easily characterized. However, the approach defeats using the detector location to determine the final state momentum of the scattered particle, as the scattering location is not well localized. Instead, this work will employ a modified version of the ""magnetic beamline"" technique, pioneered at the University of California San Diego for studies of positron interactions with atoms and molecules, whereby a strong magnetic field guides all scattered electrons along the spectrometer axis to a detector, and a retarding electric field is used to determine their momentum components parallel to and perpendicular to the spectrometer axis, thus determining their final state momentum. In addition to making these measurements on nucleobase molecules, this project will demonstrate improvements to the magnetic beamline technique, by demonstrating methods for generating high energy-resolution electron beams in strong magnetic fields. In addition, this work aims to use fast pulsing techniques to address the loss of information that is currently inherent in the technique due to reflection of electrons scattered in the backwards scattering direction."
0.014602,"This award supports an effort to expand and enrich the COMPASS program at UC Berkeley, which is aimed at improving the education and retention of under-represented students (primarily in Physics). There are five universities with similar programs based on the COMPASS model: University of Colorado Boulder, University of Maryland College Park, Rochester Institute of Technology, Chicago State University, and Arizona State University. This project joins these institutions and UC Berkeley to form the Access Network, designed to develop best practices through shared expertise. The Access network will support the development of programs intended to improve diversity and access in physics by innovating strategies to build Compass-like programs in new contexts. The network will enhance the efforts of each individual site, build knowledge of best practices for launching new programs, and share this knowledge with the physics community. A robust evaluation of the project will identify the impact of the network on supporting diversity programs and how it contributes to the dissemination of successful strategies and program elements.<br/><br/>The Access network will: (a) empower students and faculty - especially those from marginalized and/or underrepresented groups - as agents in the design, implementation, and iterative improvement of retention efforts, (b) facilitate communication and community among those involved in such efforts, and (c) create and maintain a repository of materials and strategies, all in order to (d) support local communities in adapting these materials and program elements to their unique contexts and populations. To achieve these goals, the project will engage in the following activities: (1) an annual assembly of the member programs, (2) inter-program communication through regular conference calls and inter-institutional travel, (3) documentation of local and inter-institutional innovations, and (4) synthesis and dissemination of member programs' educational materials."
0.497856,"This project was developed at an NSF Ideas Lab on ""Cracking the Olfactory Code"" and is jointly funded by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Physics Division, the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division, and the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems. The project is a synergistic combination of laboratory experiments and computer modeling that will lead to better understanding of how animals use the sense of smell to navigate in the real world. Almost universally, from flies to mice to dogs, animals use odors to find critical resources, such as food, shelter, and mates. To date, no engineered device can replicate this function and understanding the code used by the brain will lead to many novel applications. Cracking codes, from neural codes to the Enigma code of WWII, is aided by a deep understanding of the content of messages that are being transmitted and how they will be used by their intended receivers. To crack the olfactory code, the team will focus on how odors move in landscapes, how animals extract spatial and temporal cues from odor landscapes, and how they use movement for enhancing these cues while progressing towards their targets. The proposed work encompasses physical measurement of odor plumes, behavioral measurement of animals' paths through olfactory environments, electrophysiological and optical measurement of neural activity during olfactory navigation, perturbations of the environment via virtual reality and of neuronal hardware via genetics, and multilevel mathematical modeling. The PIs will teach and work with undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students and especially recruit students from underrepresented groups in science. The project's results may lead to improved methods for the detection of explosives, new olfactory robots to replace trained animals, and new theoretically-grounded advances in robotic control. The project will inform the development of technologies that interfere with the ability of flying insects (including disease vectors and crop pests) to locate their odor target, thus opening a new door for developing 'green' technologies to solve problems that are of global economic and humanitarian importance.<br/><br/>This proposal is a synergistic combination of laboratory experiments and computational modeling that will probe how animals use olfaction to navigate in their environment. Specifically, this effort seeks to solve the difficult problem of olfactory navigation through the following aims: (i) Generate and quantify standardized, naturalistic odor environments that can be used to perform empirical and theoretical tests of navigation strategies; (ii) Determine phenomenological algorithms for odor-guided navigation through behavioral experiments in diverse animal species; (iii) Determine how odor cues for navigation are encoded and used in the nervous system by recording neuronal data and simulating putative neural circuits that implement these processes; (iv) Manipulate olfactory environments and neural circuitry, to evaluate model robustness. In contrast to previous attempts to understand olfactory navigation, the present strategy emphasizes mechanisms that are biologically feasible and explores the wide range of temporal and spatial scales in which animals successfully navigate. The project will generate datasets of immediate use and importance to scientists in theoretical biology and mathematics, engineering (fluid mechanics, electronic olfaction, and robotics) and biology (neuroscience, ecology and evolution)."
0.125723,"This award supports research by a group at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) to model merging black holes and neutron stars and the gravitational waves they emit. Merging black holes and neutron stars are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO), and black hole-neutron star mergers are one possible source of short, hard gamma-ray bursts. This research program uses supercomputers to numerically solve Einstein's equations of general relativity for i) merging black holes, especially cases (such as mergers with black holes that are spinning nearly as rapidly as possible) that have not been previously explored, and ii) a black hole, spinning nearly as rapidly as possible, that merges with a neutron star, tearing the star apart.<br/><br/>Almost a century after Einstein first predicted their existence, gravitational waves---ripples of spacetime curvature---are poised to open a new window on the universe. Advanced LIGO, an NSF-supported project, is nearing completion and will soon begin searching for gravitational waves from black holes, neutron stars, and other sources, such as supernovae. By predicting the gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and neutron stars, this research program will increase the reach of Advanced LIGO and will help us to learn as much as possible about LIGO's astronomical sources. Through their participation in this program, students at CSUF, a primarily undergraduate- and Hispanic-serving institution, will learn transferable research and computational skills while playing important roles in preparing for the first direct detections of gravitational waves, an imminent discovery that could dramatically alter our understanding of the universe."
0.264262,"This award supports a project to investigate the development of undergraduate students' mathematical understanding in the context of learning physics, particularly while solving challenging upper-division physics problems. The project team will conduct an integrated program of research, curriculum development, and assessment of topics covering a typical sophomore- or junior-level course in mathematical methods. The broad goals are to conduct research on student resources, study the process of transfer from mathematics to physics and the coevolution of knowledge in the two disciplines, and develop a set of Math / Physics tasks suitable for instruction, research, and assessment materials that will integrate challenging math content with topics covered in upper-division physics core courses. This project has the potential to impact a gateway course to the upper division for physics majors. Curricular materials will be shared through electronic clearinghouses and via published research and it is anticipated that the project will inform instruction - both of math methods courses and subsequent physics courses in which the mathematics is used - nationally and internationally. The student population at California State University Fullerton includes many students from groups traditionally underrepresented in physics, so this project will provide access to research-based materials for these students and also ensure a diverse research population. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project brings together physics education research (PER) and research in undergraduate math education (RUME). It blends efforts at identifying and addressing student conceptual difficulties in physics with efforts toward understanding knowledge transfer in mathematics. The work targets a key course for physics majors, the mathematical methods course that is offered in most departments at the sophomore- or junior-level. This course is typically intended to be a bridge between introductory physics and calculus courses and the more challenging mathematics and physics encountered by students in the core courses of electricity and magnetism, classical mechanics, and modern physics / quantum mechanics. The project will strengthen the research base in a portion of the curriculum that has, to this point, largely gone unexamined, and will touch upon, and build upon, work in several related areas, including PER in other upper-division courses as well as the extensive research base in undergraduate mathematics education. This proposed work will provide significant insights into transfer by probing the extent to which the nature of student understanding depends upon the disciplinary context. The research team has many years' experience in PER and RUME and have collaborated on successful research and curriculum development projects at the upper division in thermal physics and the physics-mathematics interface."
0.319839,"In this project the Principle Investigator will determine how the physics of free-surface oceanic turbulence impacts the success of a reproductive strategy (broadcast spawning) used by corals and other marine invertebrates. The timeliness of the research is punctuated by the worldwide demise of coral reefs. The goals are to use a physics-based investigation to learn about reproduction in the living system and to see how evolutionary adaptations to complex turbulent physics shed light on subtleties of the physics themselves. Broadcast-spawning adult males and females simultaneously extrude sperm and ova into the surrounding flow. Subsequent fertilization relies primarily on turbulent stirring to mix the gametes. Most reef-building corals release buoyant gametes that rise to the free surface, where they are stirred by the free-surface turbulent flow. Buoyant particle paths in free-surface turbulence are compressible, even when the underlying 3D flow is incompressible. This results in regions of buoyant particle coalescence and divergence (corresponding to upwelling). This physical phenomena plays a role in the structure of floating and near-surface particles in the ocean, including foam streaks, oil spills, and the infamous garbage patch in the Pacific, but its effect on fertilization success is unknown. This research program will integrates laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to study the effect of free-surface turbulence on coalescence of initially distant buoyant scalars, and to predict fertilization rates for broadcast spawning corals. The Principle Investigator will integrate research methods into the teaching curriculum as an effective tool for learning fluid mechanics, and use the topic of broadcast spawning as a vehicle for getting K-16 students interested in engineering and science. A hands-on interactive module demonstrating the role of surface turbulence on the spreading and aggregation of buoyant scalars will be developed and used as part of the on-going effort to integrate research topics into outreach activities, many of which directly target women and other underrepresented K-16 students."
0.06,"The present grant is devoted to the study of interactions among a few atoms and possible ways one can achieve quantum control in the regime of ultracold temperatures relevant for quantum gases. Few-atom systems pose some of the greatest challenges facing theorists in atomic physics because of the extremely nonperturbative nature of the interactions. The goal of the proposal is to develop the theoretical tools and explore the basic capabilities and implications of new types of resonances. The investigation will center on controlling the complex multichannel collision dynamics with electromagnetic or static external fields. <br/><br/>A specific aim of the present project is to explore the viability of using a laser field to change the interactions among three or four atoms. The work could potentially have unprecedented impact with far-reaching scientific and technological ramifications. The ability to change atomic behaviors and interactions will have key impact in the quantum control of chemical reaction dynamics. A deep understanding of the ultracold atom interactions will find applications in atomic clocks, quantum information science and for the exploration of many novel phases of matter. The work has an important educational impact as it provides training to graduate and undergraduate students in forefront computational and theoretical research techniques."
0.119791,"This award supports the purchase of a supercomputer that will be used by researchers in California State University Fullerton's (CSUF's) Gravitational-Wave Physics and Astronomy Center (GWPAC). Gravitational waves are ripples of warped space and time; experiments such as the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) will soon have the astrophysical reach to observe gravitational waves from colliding black holes and neutron stars. Observing as many of these waves as possible and learning as much as possible about their sources require a generation of students with extensive knowledge of the high-performance computing (HPC) hardware and software used to model and detect gravitational waves. GWPAC will use the supercomputer to train student researchers in HPC and gravitational-wave science, empowering students to make significant contributions to the field of gravitational-wave physics and astronomy. GWPAC researchers will use the supercomputer to help maximize the scientific payoff of Advanced LIGO by i) simulating colliding black holes and neutron stars to predict the gravitational waves they emit, ii) developing tools to identify and remove artifacts in detector data that could mimic gravitational wave signals, and iii) investigating whether gravitational-wave observations can help us learn how matter behaves in the extreme conditions present in neutron stars.<br/><br/>The imminent direct detection of gravitational waves, nearly a century after Einstein predicted their existence, promises to inaugurate a new era of astronomy. Accurate predictions of the expected waveforms, thorough characterization of the detectors, and exploration of the potential for extracting astrophysical information from detections each require HPC. This award will leverage existing infrastructure to double the number of compute cores (from 240 to 480) of CSUF's first research HPC cluster of its scale. GWPAC researchers will use the cluster to simulate many more collisions of black holes and neutron stars, to develop new tools to characterize and assess data-quality impacts on the Advanced LIGO detectors, and to explore how including more realistic astrophysics in neutron-star waveform models could broaden the information we can extract from detections to include the neutron-star equation of state. The expanded cluster will magnify GWPAC's students' scientific impact and will strengthen CSUF's links with external collaborations. The cluster will provide students at CSUF, a primarily undergraduate and Hispanic-serving institution, with enhanced opportunities to acquire transferable computing skills while playing important roles in preparing for the first direct detections of gravitational waves."
0.806263,"The origin of dark matter is one of the major scientific questions of our time. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment at the Underground Laboratory at Gran Sasso, Italy (LNGS) has reported a signal that is claimed to be evidence for dark matter in the form of elementary particles called Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). However, their results seem to be in conflict with other experiments that have searched for dark matter with null results. The situation will be unclear until an independent experiment with Sodium Iodide (NaI) detectors is done with lower background.<br/><br/>This award will provide funds to develop low-background sodium iodide scintillation crystals for a sensitive dark matter search. Prior research, which was supported by an NSF EAGER grant, focused on the purification of precursor materials that are used for producing NaI powder. The activities planned with this award will be to a) address issues concerning the development of high purity low background NaI scintillation crystals grown with the high purity NaI powder and b) develop a sensitive method to measure the potassium radioactivity in the crystals to verify the very low levels needed for dark matter research. A possible second phase of research will be to deploy an array of such detectors in a low background environment that will allow a search for WIMP dark matter with lower background and higher sensitivity than achieved in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: Understanding the nature of dark matter would impact many fields of science from the largest scale of astronomy to the smallest scale of elementary particle physics. It is a mysterious form of matter that will connect to all fields once it is understood. In addition, the technology developed here, with demands on ultrapure materials, will benefit other fields that rely on such materials, such as semiconductors and nanotechnology devices."
0.196102,"Research at the Intensity Frontier builds upon the development of High Intensity Accelerators and Storage Rings. With the increase in circulating beam currents, particularly for positively charged beams, various effects such as the rise of electron clouds become increasingly challenging. For example, the beam intensity in the Fermilab Main Injector is predicted to increase approximately four-fold for the Project-X upgrade, and electron cloud formation is expected to be a problem. The IIT group intends to measure in detail electron cloud formation in the presence of different materials and under varying beam conditions. The program of effort will involve design work to evolve the performance and variety of electron cloud measurement techniques, as well as to validate or improve electron cloud models used in numerical simulations by the scientific community. The research will be performed collaboratively with experts at Fermilab and at Argonne National Laboratory.

0.959,"Very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics has been transformed by a number of stunning discoveries made by the current-generation, ground-based gamma-ray observatories operating in the 100 GeV - 10 TeV energy range. These observatories are arrays of 2-4 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that detect VHE gamma-rays via Cherenkov light from secondary electrons in electromagnetic cascades initiated by gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Developing new instruments with significantly better sensitivity is not possible by a simple replication or upgrade of existing devices. <br/><br/>With this award, the proponents will build a novel gamma-ray telescope that has the potential to transform the field, based on work by Schwarzschild and Couder. It incorporates original ideas for the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments. The international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is preparing for a future IACT array with ten times better sensitivity and broader energy coverage to exploit the evident scientific potential of VHE gamma-ray observations. Some examples of new types of gamma-ray discoveries are searching extremely deeply for dark matter in the Galactic center and halo, testing cosmology with extragalactic background light measurements, resolving the details of shock acceleration in supernova remnants and pulsar winds, and advancing the physics of extragalactic jets by population studies and observations of short-term variability.<br/><br/>This new telescope overcomes the fundamental limitations in angular resolution and field of view of current prime-focus IACTs. At the same time, it allows the application of new, lower-cost technologies for the camera focal plane sensors. This work will demonstrate the enhanced performance and improved reliability of the SCT design, and the location adjacent to VERITAS will allow the performance to be evaluated against an instrument of known sensitivity. The results from this effort will enable informed choices to be made for the construction of CTA or other future instruments. It will also enhance the capabilities of the VERITAS Observatory.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Working with industry, this work will foster emerging technologies for the mass production of relatively inexpensive, light, aspheric mirror segments that will both enable future instruments to deliver unique science capabilities and encourage use of the design in the other fields of astronomy. This project will provide a unique opportunity for integrated research and education for a substantial number of young scientists."

This project will be carried out at professor Yanbei Chen's research group at the California Institute of Technology; it will serve as a training ground for young gravitational-wave scientists --- by exposing them to a variety of research topics, ranging from quantum measurement theory to classical statistical physics. Members of Chen's research group will interact closely with members of the LIGO Lab, and the rest of the LIGO Scientific collaboration.<br/><br/>More specifically: (A) New techniques of reducing LIGO's quantum noise will be explored, including the use of active quantum optomechanical devices, the employment of optical rigidity generated by multiple optical modes, and the possible application of active medium. The domain of applicability of the so-called Energetic Quantum Limit for quantum measurements will be critically studied.

0.03,"This award will provide funding for the Coordinated Theoretical-Experimental Project on QCD (CTEQ) Summer Schools for the next three years. CTEQ is a collaboration dedicated to the effects of the strong interaction on phenomenological processes at colliders. These effects are crucial in extracting results from most collider experiments. For example, understanding the properties of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) requires understanding its production in proton-proton collisions, and that requires understanding how quarks, antiquarks and gluons fit inside of protons. It is this understanding that the CTEQ Collaboration provides. Understanding Higgs decays to quarks also depends on this knowledge. The results of the CTEQ Collaboration are essential in both experimental and theoretical particle physics and are heavily used. The Summer Schools operated by CTEQ are a training ground for numerous physicists to continue the Collaboration. They are truly international - the 2014 School is in Beijing and the 2015 School is in Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>Over 1000 physicists have attended the CTEQ Schools, which consist of nine days of lectures and discussion. Each school has 50-100 students attending. The impact on the field is profound, and many collaborations have been generated by this close interaction. Every year, many students claim a financial hardship in attending, and receive fellowships. This award will go to support students in attending the Schools. The funding will fully support 10 students, or partially support many more."
2.234925,"Technical Description of Project:<br/><br/>Our project - Fundamental Studies in Nuclear Physics - at California Institute of Technology is primarily focused on experimental research addressing fundamental properties of the free neutron. In particular we will continue taking data with the UCNA experiment while also developing hardware for construction of a new, highly sensitive experiment to search for the neutron's electric dipole moment. <br/><br/>The UCNA experiment has already produced a precision measurement of the beta-asymmetry in neutron decay using Ultra-Cold Neutrons for the first time. This quantity allows a sensitive test of the unitarity of the CKM quark-mixing matrix and has the potential to provide evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle interactions. With recent improvements to the apparatus we are poised to improve the precision on the asymmetry down to ~ 0.3% with additional data-taking and analysis during the period of this grant. <br/><br/>The goal of the new electric dipole moment experiment - nEDM at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory - is to improve the sensitivity by a factor of 100 compared to previous measurements; observation of an electric dipole moment signals violation of time-reversal and charge-parity (CP) symmetry, and could provide important information related to the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe and the new physical phenomena that is responsible. <br/><br/>Non-technical Description of Project<br/><br/>Our project at Caltech is primarily focused on studying fundamental properties of the free neutron. The neutron is an unstable particle and decays with a ten minute half-life into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino. We are making precision measurements of the neutron decay using very slow neutrons that can be stored in bottles. These measurements should allow us to make the most precise measurements of the distribution of electrons from the decay of spin-polarized neutrons. These data can push our understanding of the neutron's decay to the limits of theoretical understanding and may indicate that our current picture is incomplete and must be revised. <br/><br/>We are also developing a new experiment to search for an electric dipole for the free neutron. An electric dipole is a separation of the plus and minus charge within this neutral particle. The existence of this dipole would signal a significant breakdown of so-called Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry. A significant breakdown of this symmetry has been suggested to explain why the universe is dominated by material composed of standard particles with virtually no anti-particles present in the universe. This puzzle (more matter than anti-matter) has stumped physicists for many years and we hope to discover and measure the neutron's electric dipole to help explain this basic property of the universe. <br/><br/>We also note that participation by postdoctoral scholars as well as graduate and undergraduate students is an essential part of the research program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their training and education in this frontier area of nuclear physics."

The calorimeter is based on the microfluidic calorimeter platform developed at Caltech and will have superior performance, including a power resolution at 2% of single worm power generation, a response time of 0.5s and on-chip worm incubation enabling continuous monitoring of a worms activity for over 48 hours. C. elegans will serve as the major target because it is an important model organism that has been extensively used in biological research. In this program thermogenesis in these manipulated worms will be employed to differentiate metabolic pathways and study longevity. First, a number of small molecule inhibitors specific to different biochemical pathways, such as Cyclohexamine (targets Ribosomes) and Actinomycin D (targets RN Polymerases I, II & III), will be used to investigate the contribution of these pathways to metabolism, which will provide a clearer picture of the relative contribution of several important biochemical pathways to overall metabolism in C. elegans. Next, the effect of diet and starvation on the metabolism of adult worms will be studied during their development. Finally, the relation between metabolism and longevity for worms with life-extending genetic mutations will be investigated. The PI and co-PI are committed to dissemination of the technology, outreach and education. The Kavli Nanoscience Institute at Caltech is capable of moderate-scale production of devices. The PI and Co-PI have actively participated in Caltech's Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURF) and Minority Undergraduate Research Program (MURF) for the past two decades.

The goal is to extend the NCG approach to fractional Hall effects. For quasicrystal structures, the aim is to combine algebro-geometric techniques and NCG methods. A second part of the research deals with the use of NCG techniques in spin foams models, as developed in recent work of the PI, with the aim of combining this method with the almost commutative geometries used in the NCG approach to particle physics models. A third part of the proposal deals with extending models of particle physics and cosmology based on NCG, and to connect these models of low energy limits of String Theory. The last part proposes a new point of view, based on the correspondence between BPS states counting and statistical physics model of crystal melting recently developed in String Theory. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The PI was invited speaker in the Mathematical Physics session of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Hyderabad 2010, and plenary speaker in the European Congress of Mathematics, Amsterdam 2008. The PI graduated twelve PhD students over the past five years (eight belonging to ethnic minorities) and is currently supervising seven other graduate students. The PI has also supervised eleven undergraduates at Caltech (four belonging to underrepresented groups) on summer research projects. In the past two years, seven papers were coauthored by the PI with Caltech undergraduates. The PI is also mentoring two postdocs (one from an underrepresented group). For outreach the PI has authored four research monographs and has edited eight volumes arising from conferences, workshops and special programs that she co-organized over the past few years.

0.582043,"Plasmas are gas-phase assemblies of ions, electrons, and neutral molecules/atoms. When materials surfaces are exposed to plasmas, many complex physical and chemical interactions take place. In particular, energetic ions can dislodge violently, interact electronically, or form chemical bonds with surface atoms. The formation and breakage of chemical bonds (reactions) between energetic gas-phase ions and surfaces are very poorly understood. This research is focused in improving the understanding of such reaction mechanisms and controlling the outcome of plasma-surface interactions. The experimental results will stimulate the development and testing of relevant theories, and introduce new knowledge on reactive scattering dynamics into chemical curricula.<br/><br/>Findings from this research should impact surface science and plasma processing, important technologies for characterizing and treating, coating, or etching solid surfaces for applications ranging from surface functionalization, to microelectronics fabrication, and space exploration. The research should lead to a new paradigm for selecting plasma chemistries and conditions, based on the reactivity and overall scattering dynamics of specific ions formed in the plasma, thus speeding up and making less expensive the development of plasma processes for many applications."
0.072855,"Physical reality is described in modern physics using four fundamental forces: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, and gravity. The strong nuclear force is responsible for a long list of phenomena that are crucial to the existence of the universe. For example, the strong force holds together atomic nuclei, it fuels the burning of the sun and all other stars, and it governed the fate of the very early universe. Although the fundamental equations describing the strong force (or quantum chromodynamics, QCD) were written down four decades ago, an in-depth understanding of its properties is still lacking. This project will help advance the understanding of key features of the strong force at very high temperatures and densities. At temperatures of about 1,000,000,000,000 degrees all matter subject to the strong nuclear force forms a state of matter called quark gluon plasma. Quark gluon plasma was prevalent in the early universe milliseconds after the Big Bang. The quark gluon plasma can be recreated in the laboratory in collisions of very large nuclei in the highest energy collider facilities in the world, such as the Large Hadron Collider in Europe and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the US. The PI, working with his graduate students, will carry out research to improve the understanding of the formation and development of quark gluon plasma in nuclear collisions. <br/><br/>This project will develop a comprehensive computational simulation of nuclear collisions. The initial phase of those collisions at high energy is dominated by strong, nonlinear gluon fields. Because nuclei collide in random configurations and with random impact parameters an event-by-event Monte Carlo simulation of gluon fields will be provided. The system eventually reaches approximate local kinetic equilibrium and the further time evolution can be followed up by relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics. Comparison to data from LHC and RHIC can determine the equation of state and important transport coefficients of quark gluon plasma. The project will also shed light on the coupling of quark gluon plasma to electromagnetic probes (photons). In addition, the PI and his students will study the effect of the initial strong gluon fields on very fast quarks and gluons (jets), and on heavy quarks. Both of those are important probes for properties of quark gluon plasma. The project will also provide tools for the next generation collider experiments planned at an electron ion collider. The latter will allow for a systematic study of strong gluon fields and the creation of quark and gluon jets in a nuclear environment."
0.137087,"Central to the survival of many organisms is their ability to manipulate inorganic molecules into elaborate crystalline structures such as skeletons, teeth, and protective shells. This ubiquitous process of ""biomineralization"" depends on the precise action of specialized proteins within cells to form minerals where they are needed and prevent their accumulation in sensitive tissues. Although progress has been made, much is not understood about how biomineralization is realized inside of individual cells and which genes control the process. This collaborative project will address this challenge by applying recent advances in magnetic imaging technology to detailed studies of biomineralization in a simple and well-controlled biological system: the production of nanoscale magnetic particles within magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), and the use by MTB of chains of these particles (known as magnetosomes) for orientation and travel along the Earth's magnetic field lines (known as magnetotaxis). During this project, students and postdoctoral researchers will receive training in scientific practices at the interface of the physical and life sciences. In addition, the project may inform the development of improved materials with broad practical relevance, as products of biomineralization have superior properties compared to those currently engineered by humans.<br/><br/>The scientific goals of this project are to study the molecular mechanisms governing biomineralization and the development of magnetic nanoparticles in MTB. The studies will employ a ""diamond magnetic imager"" that exploits a nanoscale layer of quantum sensors at the surface of a diamond chip, enabling imaging of magnetic field patterns from individual MTB in a population under ambient laboratory conditions, with better than 50 nanometer spatial resolution and greater than 1 millimeter field-of-view. The investigators will apply the diamond magnetic imager to studies of magnetic nanoparticle growth in various MTB species and biomineralization mutants. The project will open a new window onto the physical processes enabling magnetotaxis, including the transition of magnetic nanoparticles from a superparamagnetic to a stable single-domain magnetic state during magnetic nanoparticle growth, and the role of interactions between magnetic nanoparticles within individual MTB. Magnetic measurements on genetic mutants will provide biological insights into the genes controlling the biomineralization process. Observations will also be made of the dynamics of the magnetic nanoparticle chain during the cell division cycle, both through time series magnetic measurements on different MTB as well as magnetic imaging of individual living MTB."

Its mathematical consistency requires more than the four spacetime dimensions, and the ways in which the extra dimensions are dealth with in turn determines the observed particles and forces. Therefore, it is important to understand the imprints left by the geometry and topology of the extra dimensions on the observed four-dimensional spacetime. The PI's will explore fundamental aspects of string theory and supergravity as they relate to these issues. As such, this project advances the national interest by promoting progress in science and the search for new physical laws describing uncharted territories of quantum gravity. This project is also envisioned to have broader impact by boosting the interfaces between string theory and mathematics. The PIs will also provide critical training to postdocs and students, and intend to give public lectures on their research results and organize workshops. <br/><br/>More technically, the PIs aim to construct the full spacetime effective action of different string theory and M-theory compactifications to all orders in the slope parameter and its formulation in superspace. Their goal is to use physics to solve long-standing problems in mathematics (e.g,. the search of a ""Calabi-Yau-type"" theorem for manifolds with exceptional holonomy or to search for an analogue of mirror symmetry). Further, the PI's will study the construction of an action principle for higher-spin theory, its quantization, higher-spin invariant functionals, and higher-spin black holes. They will also study supersymmetric field theories in curved backgrounds, superconformal field theories in diverse dimensions, and a geometrical description of duality symmetries of strings and branes."
0.06,"The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. This award supports the first searches of Advanced LIGO data for gravitational waves from the youngest neutron stars in the galaxy. As they spin down over the years, these stars can tell us about the properties of matter under the most extreme conditions since the Big Bang: supernuclear densities, relativistic speeds, superconducting and superfluid at a hundred million degrees. One day they may also be used to test whether Einstein's general theory of relativity is the correct description of gravity at astrophysical scales.<br/><br/>The bulk of the work involves the upgrade and implementation of a data analysis code pipeline to perform matched filtering searches for continuous gravitational waves from young supernova remnants. Improvements in the code and data will allow more sensitive searches than ever before. This code will also be adapted for the purpose of detector characterization to assist with improving the LIGO interferometers' performance over the course of their first science run, particularly with regard to narrow-band spectral artifacts."

0.036,"The December 15-19, 2014 Workshop on Physics Approach to Simplifying Complexity in Biology will bring together physical scientists together with biologists to address basic science problems in biology. Phyicists and biologists are working together to further our progress in the development of predictive, quantitative biology and this workshop is essential in this direction. The organizers bring scientists to examine both the origins of living matter and the complexity that has evolved with time. The emergent phenomena of life is hardly predictable from the fundamental laws of physics or the theorems of mathematics. Emergent living organisms form a unique state of complex adaptive matter; this complex adaptability presumably has its roots in natural selection because the adaptation of natural selection gives rise to ever increasing fitness.<br/><br/>The organizers will bring together the physics and condensed matter communities in Asia with those in the US and Europe and merge them with biologists and ecologists to form a frontier effort that spans multiple disciplines. The range of subjects will be wide, in the hopes that unifying, quantitative themes can be mapped out. The workshop will cover areas ranging from The Origins of Complexity to The Emergence of Collective Behavior to Instability in Complex Adaptive Matter, which has connections to many ill-understood topics such as the dynamics of protein dis-function, collective conflicts in communities, and the fundamental origins of diseases such as cancer viewed from a deep perspective. The impact will be to find unifying, simple but deep principles which can tie together the bewildering complexity of biology from the unified perspective of physics which has been so successful in the past."
0.78044,"Gamma-ray astrophysics is a rapidly evolving field that has experienced a huge development during the last five years with the successes of a new generation of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, such as VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System), located in southern Arizona, and the launch of the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope. Very high energy (VHE, with energies above 100 GeV) gamma-ray observations sample the sky at the highest photon energies, pointing towards the most extreme cosmic accelerators. The mechanisms by which particles are accelerated and produce VHE gamma-rays are of great interest because of the extreme environments where such acceleration takes place: strong radiation fields (pulsars), shock acceleration (SNRs) or accretion powered relativistic jets (blazars).The exponentially increasing numbers of detected sources, together with the improved quality of observations, are dramatically improving our knowledge of the most extreme processes in the universe.<br/><br/>This award provides operational funding for scientists at Barnard College to carry out high energy astrophysics studies with VERITAS, an array of four large imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes that has been fully operational since spring 2007. VERITAS represents a dramatic step forward in the study of extreme astrophysical processes in the universe, and is providing high-quality gamma-ray observations and an increasing number of source detections. The PI will contribute by participating in observing campaigns, carrying out scientific data analysis, and working on code development for improvements to VERITAS analysis techniques. In particular, the PI will focus on the study of extragalactic sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) of the blazar class, as well as Galactic sources, and unidentified GeV-TeV sources, including both archival and new multi-wavelength studies, in order to study the nature of particle acceleration in these objects. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: The Barnard Group expects to play a strong role in outreach efforts to K-12 students. As a Barnard College faculty member, the PI is able to reach a broad audience of high school girls interested in science by participating in college-sponsored science lectures such as the Saturday Science Seminars. The PI's research at Barnard College, a 4-year liberal arts school for women, has significant impact in influencing women in the physical sciences, and the PI will continue to be a mentor to undergraduate women in astrophysics research."
0.728,"Precise experimental tests of fundamental particle properties are now a well-established way to search for new laws of nature beyond our current physical knowledge. This research program centers around two experiments to make precise measurements of physical properties of the neutron. The first experiment, called UCNA, is being carried out at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, using extremely slow neutrons (ultra-cold neutrons, or UCN), which have such low energy that they can be stored in magnetic ""bottles"". This allows the experiment to make a precise measurement of the direction of the electron emitted when a neutron decays into a proton, an electron and a particle called an anti-neutrino. This provides needed information about the theory of radioactivity (also called the weak nuclear force). In addition, the PI and his group are developing equipment for a future experiment to search for a possible electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. The existence of this EDM would be a signal of new physics beyond our current knowledge and could help to explain why the universe is dominated by matter, whereas the Standard Model of particle physics predicts there should be nearly equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Participation by postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduates is an essential part of the research program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their training and education in this frontier area of nuclear physics.<br/><br/>This project is primarily focused on experimental research addressing fundamental properties of the free neutron. In particular the group will continue analyzing data from the UCNA experiment while also constructing hardware for a new, highly sensitive experiment to search for the neutron's EDM. The UCNA experiment will provide a high precision measurement of the beta-asymmetry in neutron decay using Ultra-Cold Neutrons for the first time. This quantity allows a sensitive test of the unitarity of the weak quark-mixing matrix and has the potential to provide evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle interactions. With recent improvements to the apparatus the group is poised to improve the precision on the asymmetry down to ~ 0.3% with additional data-taking and analysis during the period of this grant. The goal of the new EDM experiment, called nEDM, is being done at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and will improve the upper limit by a factor of 100 compared to previous measurements; observation of an EDM signals violation of time-reversal and charge-parity (CP) symmetry, and could provide important information related to the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe."
0.032931,"This project will concern the investigation of reactions of slow electrons with biomolecules. Such slow electrons are typically found in human tissue after irradiation with deep ultra-violet photons and X-rays. The processes concerned will be in the excitation of electron states in the biomolecule, a process which is complicated by the size of such molecules, and involves close collaboration between two established and advanced theoretical (Caltech) and experimental (Cal State Fullerton) groups. Recent success in work with water has provided impetus for this collaboration to look at more complex molecules - methanol and ethanol and has provided a good foundation for this direction of research.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this collaboration is its involvement of international experimental (U. Juiz de Fora) and theoretical groups (USP, U. Parana in Curitiba, Unicamp) in Brazil. It also provides involvement of US undergraduate students at Cal State Fullerton to go to Brazil to carry out summer research to do experimental work in developing projects there as well as taking electron-biomolecule collisions data to transfer US technology to Brazil and to foster scientific relations between the two countries. This also provides impetus for Brazilian faculty and students from these universities to come to the USA to CIT/CSUF and collaborate. The students who participate get international experience and are very likely to pursue graduate studies in physics or physical chemistry. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities."
0.2404,"Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays. VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. This award supports scientists at Barnard College to carry out research with VERITAS. The group will participate in both technical operations in support of the observatory and scientific investigations with a focus on studying emission from active galaxies, pulsar wind nebula, and gamma-ray bursts. The Barnard College group is heavily engaged in education and outreach efforts. They involve undergraduate students in astrophysics research with an emphasis on broadening the participation of women. They are also involved in outreach efforts to high-school students in the New York City area. <br/><br/>VERITAS has embarked upon a broad program of Galactic and extragalactic source observations, as well as studies of signatures for new physics such as dark matter. With this award the Barnard College group will participate in VERITAS observing and calibration campaigns and work on code development for improvements to VERITAS analysis techniques. Their scientific program includes searching for high energy emission and variability in blazars, using pulsar wind nebula and multi-messenger approaches to investigate the origin of cosmic rays, and studying gamma-ray bursts."
0.089996,"The elementary particles or ""quanta"" of light have a wavelength of about 500 nanometers (less than 20 millionths of an inch). The study of the interaction of these photons with the electrons inside atoms led to development of devices such as lasers, atomic clocks, supersensitive miniature magnetometers, etc. The goal of the present project is to extend these studies to photons of much shorter wavelengths: 10,000 to 100,000 times shorter. These photons, invisible to the naked eye, begin to enter the regime where they are known as ""gamma-photons"" or ""gamma-rays."" Rather than interacting with the electrons inside atoms, these high energy photons interact with the nucleus of the atom. Some of the reasons gamma-photons might be better than conventional (optical) photons for applications is that they can be detected more easily, they can be focused to much smaller spots (ultimately limited by the wavelength of the photon), and they can in principle help process information more quickly because of their higher frequencies. A problem is that they are currently very difficult and expensive to produce and hard to control precisely because conventional optical lenses and mirrors do not work at such short wavelengths. This work seeks to advance the development of compact (""table-top"") sources of highly controlled gamma-photons, both through experiments and theoretical work. In effect, this work seeks to extend the field of ""quantum optics"" to wavelengths approaching the gamma-ray regime. If successful, the work may find applications in the areas of quantum information science, spectroscopy, microscopy, metrology, and sensors. The proposed joint theoretical and experimental research program will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging field of the experimental and theoretical quantum gamma-optics as well as in the related (and more general) experimental techniques, analytical methods, and numerical modeling.<br/><br/>The project is focused on the experimental and theoretical development of methods to coherently control the interaction of gamma-photons with nuclear ensembles via the variation of the resonant frequency of the nuclear transition in the laboratory reference frame. This variation is achieved via the Doppler shift associated with precisely vibrating the solid through which the photon passes. This is used in conjunction with a source of heralded single photons provided by the essentially simultaneous emission of two photons at 122 keV and 14.4 keV via the natural radioactive decay of Cobalt-57. The advantages of nuclear transitions over electronic transitions is that they have narrow, lifetime-broadened spectral linewidths in bulk solids at room temperature (due to the large mass and small size of nucleons, shielding from the environment, and recoilless absorption due to the Mossbauer effect). This results in orders-of-magnitude stronger interaction of the photons with the nuclear ensemble. Progress has been limited, however, by the absence of bright coherent sources and high finesse resonators in the desired short wavelength range. The present work is based on the lead scientist's recent realization of a table-top source of ultra-short photon sources in the 14.4 keV range with coherent properties, as well as the demonstration of efficient control of single gamma-photon waveforms (F. Vagizov et al., Nature, vol. 508| 3 April 2014, p. 80). The technical and fundamental limitations of the technique as presently developed will be explored and new techniques for the production of short intense pulses and single gamma-photon shaping will be developed. Applications for the controlled single-photon waveforms will be explored in the areas of quantum information science."
1.59,"This award funds the research activities of Profs. Csaba Csaki, Yuval Grossman, Toichiro Kinoshita, Peter Lepage, Liam McAllister and Maxim Perelstein at Cornell University. <br/><br/>The investigators propose to study some of the most important and exciting topics in a variety of fields within high-energy theory, including particle physics in and beyond the Standard Model, collider physics, string theory, and cosmology. Research on the Standard Model (SM) consists of investigations of flavor and neutrino physics, lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and precision quantum electrodynamics (QED). Beyond the Standard Model, explorations of diverse models of the TeV scale are proposed, together with studies of the new collider physics techniques necessary for testing them. Investigations of aspects of dark matter physics are also proposed. Within string theory the primary focus is on understanding the effective theories arising in string compactifications, and exploring the implications of string theory for cosmology. Intellectual merit: The Cornell particle theory group carries out state-of-the-art research in nearly every major area of modern particle theory. The unifying theme of the group's research program is a distinctive focus on theoretical problems that are relevant for present and future experiments, including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the intensity frontier program, dark matter searches, and cosmic microwave background experiments. The proposed research is directed at maximizing the scientific impact of these experiments. The most important recent development in particle physics is the historic discovery of the Higgs(-like) boson, as part of the wealth of data produced by the 2010-2012 runs of the LHC. Professors Csaki, Grossman and Perelstein will focus their attention over the next five years on physics related to current and future colliders. Csaki will explore unconventional supersymmetric models that are still viable in light of the LHC data; alternative Higgs models, including a Higgslike dilaton and the composite Higgs; and other TeV-scale models consistent with LHC results. Grossman will explore the physics that is relevant to the intensity frontier program in the near and more distant future. This includes charm and beauty physics, charge-parity (CP) violation, and the study of neutrino physics. Perelstein's research plans include using the new window on TeV-scale physics provided by the 125 GeV boson to glean new information about possible physics beyond the Standard Model; understanding the implications of the direct LHC searches for new physics, focusing in particular on naturalness issues; and proposing new LHC searches motivated by both theoretical and experimental developments. In parallel, Perelstein proposes to continue to contribute to theoretical interpretations of dark matter searches, where several interesting hints of detection have already been reported, and much more data will soon become available. Professor Lepage, as a leading member of the ""High Precision QCD"" (HPQCD) lattice gauge theory collaboration, will continue the pursuit of high-precision results for heavy quark physics from lattice gauge theory, obtaining semileptonic D-meson form factors for charm physics; extending b-quark results to the same precision (of order 1%) as the charm observables; and determining the quark masses and the strong coupling constant to high precision. Professor Kinoshita has devoted the past decade to a systematic evaluation of the five-loop QED contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the electron. In the next few years, he proposes to improve the numerical evaluation of his group's analytic results. Professor McAllister plans to investigate the physics of the very early universe, using cosmological observations of ultraviolet-sensitive quantities to shed light on theories of quantum gravity. McAllister's primary focus will be understanding inflationary dynamics in compactifications of string theory, but he also proposes to study the vacuum structure of non-supersymmetric string compactifications. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The Cornell particle theory group puts a high priority on the training of graduate students and postdocs, as well as on the wide dissemination of recent research results to the general public. Over the past three years, the group graduated twelve students, a majority of whom are now postdocs, while eight of our former students who graduated over the past decade now have faculty positions in the U.S. or abroad. Every member of the group is vigorously pursuing all possibilities for outreach to the general public. Numerous public talks, articles, colloquia, high school lectures and teacher conferences have been produced in the past, and will continue to be organized in the future by the group members."
0.72,"The projects span several topics in general relativity, gravitational-wave physics, and data analysis. The principal goals are to: (i) compute spin effects at higher post-Newtonian order in the gravitational radiation from compact binaries, and use these results, together with inputs from gravitational self-force calculations, to improve the effective-one-body formalism; (ii) calibrate effective-one-body templates of precessing, spinning, compact binaries to accurate numerical simulations in the comparable and small mass-ratio limits; (iii) implement these effective-one-body templates in LIGO software; and (iv) develop detection strategies for spinning, compact binaries and carry out searches with LIGO data.<br/><br/>Coalescing compact binaries are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO). Templates for detecting non-spinning, merging, compact binaries have been built and used in LIGO searches. The upgrade to the Advanced LIGO configuration has already started and will be completed in 2014-2015, improving the facility's sensitivity by a factor of ten with respect to LIGO, thus increasing the event rates for many astrophysical sources by a factor of one thousand. The research proposed herein seeks to build on these progresses, develop highly refined templates for detecting precessing, spinning compact binaries, thereby extracting the unique physics encoded within the waves that such binaries produce. Thus, the proposed research would enhance the potential of Advanced LIGO's detectors to make important discoveries."
0.12,"This grant supports the theoretical study of an electrical discharge phenomenon, called multipactor, that occurs in a broad range of microwave devices. Multipactor is a pernicious electrical discharge that can damage or destroy accelerator structures and microwave components and related electronics, such as antennas, satellite payloads, or radar systems. Despite decades of study, especially in connection with rf systems for particle accelerators, it remains a problem, and no consistent way has been found to eliminate it. The improved understanding anticipated from this work will enable more compact and higher-gradient particle accelerators. Many accelerator applications stand to benefit from this, such as compact medical accelerators, accelerator-based neutron and light sources used for basic research, and accelerator-based nuclear energy generation and transmutation of nuclear waste. Space and satellite communications will further benefit from this study. The grant will support one graduate student, and will contribute to the literature, course material, and further educational outreach.<br/><br/>The objective is to analyze multipactor in multicarrier systems using a novel multipactor theory based on techniques from nonlinear dynamics and chaos. Multipactor in the presence of multiple carrier rf signals (i.e. multiple rf frequencies) is an especially challenging problem that has almost no theoretical studies. The new approach aims to identify multipacting region boundaries and stability by globally analyzing the structure of dynamical space. The theoretical results will be tested against computer simulations using a particle-in-cell code, and against experiments conducted by our collaborators at ValSpace Consortium in Valencia, Spain."

It is also a special year for this topic because 2015 has been designated the International Year of Light by the United Nations."
0.45,"In the late 1800s, flash photography enabled the motion of macroscopic objects to be slowed to the point where the true order of events could be extracted. Nearly a century later, femtosecond pulses (1 femtosecond is one millionth of one billionth of a second) enabled the motions of atoms to be frozen during the formation and breakup of molecules, resulting in an improved microscopic picture of chemistry. The advent of attosecond pulses, a million times shorter, allows the motion of the tiniest building block of matter, the electron, to be stopped in its tracks. Professors Chang, of the University of Central Florida, and Hill, of the University of Maryland, together with their students, use attosecond laser pulses to study electronic charge dynamics on timescales commensurate with its indigenous motion in atomic and molecular systems. Charge migration, as it is known, is central to a variety of important processes such as photosynthesis, radiation damage in biomolecules and photovoltaics used in solar panels. This collaborative project is providing insight into the collective and interactive motion of electrons that are ubiquitous in atoms, molecules and solids. An improved understanding of charge migration will have broad application from controlling the flow of energy within a molecule to tailoring the performance of materials to specific needs.<br/><br/>Photoinduced charge separation in molecules is the first step in many chemical processes and central to our understanding of electron correlation and the energy exchange between electronic and nuclear motion responsible for catalysis, photosynthesis, photovoltaics and radiation damage in biomolecules. Comprehensive numerical simulations of complex molecules predict that when an electron is ?suddenly? removed from one end of a chain molecule, such as a small peptide, the hole can move to the other end of the molecule in less than 10 fs, before the electron-nuclear coupling takes place. Intense, isolated attosecond pulses are required to study this naturally-occurring charge migration. Professors Chang and Hill, in a collaborative project between the University of Central Florida (UCF) and the University of Maryland (UMD), exploit the attosecond source at UCF to investigate charge migration in multi-electron atoms (He) and multi-atom molecules (SO2) via attosecond pump - attosecond probe experiments. The pump pulse initiates rapid excitation (in the absence of nuclear motion in the molecular case) while the probe pulse monitors the ensuing charge migration. Two probe techniques are used to ?watch? the charge migration: transient absorption and photoelectron angular distribution. In distinction with previous attosecond studies, where charge migration was investigated in the presence of a strong external infrared field, the UCF-UMD study is probing charge migration subsequent to excitation but in the absence of any external perturbation. As a consequence, this project is providing a clearer understanding of charge separation, energy flow and electron-nuclear charge coupling, which, as stated above, are relevant to a variety of processes associated with chemical reactions, dynamics in condensed matter systems and biological phenomena. A secondary goal of this project is the development of general experimental tools that can be transferred to more complicated systems, such as ABCU (1-azabicyclo [3.3.3] undecane), for which theoretical predictions exist and the excitation spectra fall near those of the model systems of this study."
6.702146,"This award will provide funds for the construction of the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory to be built at Sierra Negra in Mexico. The costs for hardware, engineering, and contract (nonscientist) labor to build HAWC are being provided here. The observations of HAWC will probe the most extreme environments in the Universe, providing a unique view of non-thermal processes in the Galaxy and beyond. The key science goals of HAWC are to: (a) Measure the spectrum of Galactic sources to the highest energies; (b) Map the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission from 1 TeV to 100 TeV measuring the cosmic-ray flux and spectrum across the Galaxy; (c) Study transient emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN); (d) Monitor the sky for 100 GeV emission from gamma-ray bursts; and (e) Search for new TeV physics with HAWC's unbiased sky survey. HAWC measurements have the potential to shed light on the fundamental symmetries of nature, including the search for Lorentz violation at extreme energies, the search for the dark matter in the universe, and the direct detection of massive relic particles.<br/><br/>HAWC is an array consisting of 250 large water tanks, each instrumented with three photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) mounted on the bottom of the tank. The tanks will cover an area of ~20,000 square meters. The expanded detection, increased altitude and optical isolation of the detector elements lead to a 15-fold increase in sensitivity relative to Milagro, which performed the deepest wide-field survey of the TeV sky to date. Refinement of the design and cost has been achieved through prototyping and deploying a test array at the HAWC site. The cost estimate and design sensitivity have stayed roughly constant through the development process. The goal is to begin taking data while the array is under construction and to be online within approximately three years. This will allow HAWC to run while the Fermi mission is ongoing.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: HAWC is an all-sky instrument that will have the sensitivity to extend the measurement of satellite-discovered sources to TeV energies. HAWC will build on the strong outreach record of Milagro to bring this exciting field of research to students and the general public. Since HAWC is a joint US-Mexican project, this will be an excellent opportunity to attract talented Hispanic students to the field of Particle Astrophysics and to Physics in general. The group has developed an outreach video about HAWC and web materials about HAWC and Particle Astrophysics in both Spanish and English."

A further benefit of this program is that complex plasma applications appear to be a potentially very fertile field for small, high-tech start-up companies which will perceive this subject as a encouraging innovation source for marketplace realization of new plasma technologies."
0.306817,"While the best-known application for particle accelerators is associated with high-energy physics, other applications such as cancer treatment and materials processing are becoming increasingly important. Since the pioneering accelerators of the 1930s the maximum energy to which particles can be accelerated, known as the energy frontier, has increased many orders of magnitude. The intensity frontier, which refers to the number of particles that can be simultaneously accelerated, has progressed much more slowly, despite the importance of a number of applications that require an increased particle flux. A major limitation to accelerating more intense beams is the inherently nonlinear behavior that becomes relevant when particle beam currents are increased.<br/><br/>It is known that linear focusing forces can stably transport a charged particle beam. This has led to a strong reliance on linear transport systems, albeit with weak nonlinear elements to correct for various unavoidable beam nonlinearities. Recent theoretical work has resulted in a fundamental rethinking of the conventional wisdom, which considered nonlinear elements as inherently problematic, and opened the possibility of a significant increase in the intensity frontier.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>This award will support the use of the unique capabilities of the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) to experimentally explore, in concert with simulation, a practical demonstration of using a strongly nonlinear lattice to stably transport intense beams. The research program will exploit the UMER apparatus to fill the gap between theoretical conjecture and practical realization. This will be accomplished by examining the many deviations from the simplifying assumptions necessary in a tractable analytic treatment, which are inevitable in a real experiment. In addition to the direct benefit of facilitating stable operation of accelerators at new intensity levels, the fundamental demonstration that strong nonlinearities can be beneficial, when weaker nonlinearities degrade performance, could be an important intellectual contribution to accelerator physics.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Operating accelerators at higher intensity levels will have a substantial impact to areas such as materials processing, accelerator based nuclear energy generation and transmutation of nuclear waste, as well as high-energy physics. In addition to the direct research effort, this program will carry out workforce training in accelerator-related careers, educating the next generation of accelerator scientists. The outreach program carried out by the PI also creates research opportunities for both local high school students and undergraduates from across the country."
0.36,"A technique is being developed for sub-femtosecond pulse generation and sub-cycle pulse shaping. The essence of the technique is the preparation of a macroscopic medium in a coherent superposition-state. This preparation is accomplished by two laser pulses tuned close to a molecular Raman resonance. The resultant molecular motion modulates the input light to produce a wide spectrum of discrete sidebands. Broadband coherent generation in Raman-active crystals is shown, and the capability to control spectral phases of the Raman sidebands in a precise and stable manner is demonstrated. This is the first step toward sub-cycle pulse shaping, which will allow synthesis of waveforms where the electric field is an arbitrary predetermined function of time, not limited to quasi-sinusoidal oscillations. As a result, a direct and precise control of electron trajectories in photoionization and high-order harmonic generation will become possible. In addition, coherent transfer of optical orbital angular momentum in multi-order Raman generation is investigated. The use of singular light beams, such as optical vortices, provides a new degree of freedom for ultrashort pulse manipulation, and will open a possibility for spatio-temporal engineering of sub-cycle pulses.<br/><br/>The broad impact of this research derives not only from the promised discoveries in fundamental science, but also come from a variety of practical applications of the new broad-band Raman source. These applications are: optical coherence tomography, ultrafast spectroscopy, precision metrology, to name a few. In addition, the technique of molecular modulation can be used to generate coherent radiation in the UV and IR spectral regions, where laser sources are not readily available. Eventually, applications to lithography, chemistry, biology, and astronomy may become practical. An important part of this project is the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students. The project provides these students with training in the field of quantum optics and laser physics and will allow them to develop both theoretical and experimental skills which are in high demand."

0.556914,"Project: This is a project to create a POLS-SAVI node at the University of Maryland (UMD). This node, which was conceived during the early stages of the newly created Student Research Network and is vastly expanded under Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) initiative, will also bring in two leading institutions. One is the Technical University of Munich (TUM), which is one of the leading centers in Biophysics in Germany. The other is the National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in India, which enjoys a preeminent stature in the biophysics in the country. These three institutions will add greatly to the POLS-SAVI network both in scientific expertise as well as in the educational aspects. The faculty in the three institutions who will join the POLS-SAVI network bring to bear expertise in a number of areas in biological physics. Among the faculty there is considerable expertise in the basics of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which are becoming increasingly important in tackling problems in single molecule force spectroscopy, a tool that is being used to discover the role of mechanical forces in biology. Methods in these areas are key in understanding fluctuation effects in finite systems including various metabolic and gene networks. On the experimental side both in TUM and UMD a variety of problems probing the response of forces from single molecule to cellular level are being performed using a variety of techniques. Research is also being carried out to understand interactions between proteins and how such interactions are involved in signaling networks. The three universities also focus on functions of molecular machines, mechanics of cytoskeletal networks, the role of membranes in biological functions, and gene networks. Thus, from a scientific perspective UMD, TUM, and NCBS are involved in researches covering the gamut of temporal and length scales. These topics add to and enhance the scope of issues that are being covered by other participating institutions. All three institutions are also deeply involved in educating students in this new emerging area. The collective experience gathered in the three continents will also be useful as the institutions in the network prepare to develop new curriculum. The major scientific benefit of leveraging the entire resources of the network will enable the participants to vastly expand their ability to conduct research by learning from the expertise available in the network rather than be limited by the tools available in one's home institution. In addition, the proposed video conferencing throughout the year between the students and the annual meeting in different venues add to invaluable educational experience in enhancing the scope of training in the POLS. Third, the international scope of the proposed network will have a world-wide impact on the scientific aspect by fostering many potentially powerful collaborations. The three institutions will aid in achieving the basic mission of the POLS-SAVI network, which in turn will have substantial impact on the development, use and application of quantitative methods in biological problems. <br/><br/>This project is being supported jointly by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and by the Molecular Biophysics Program in Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.243689,"The Daya Bay collaboration aims to measure the ""last"" neutrino mixing angle, theta_13, with a sensitivity in sin^2(2theta_13) of 1%. Establishment of a nonzero value for this mixing angle would strongly suggest the possibility of CP violation in the neutrino sector. Daya Bay is an international collaboration, including groups from the People's Republic of China and groups from the United States. This award supports the contributions of the Siena College group. Siena has contributed to the water pool muon veto shield and is now finishing the design and construction of a multi-channel resistivity monitoring system to monitor the purity of the water in the muon pools. Once this is installed in China, the Siena effort will focus on analysis, first of the data from the water monitoring system and then the physics data from the anti-neutrino detectors.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This program will provide research opportunities for undergraduates and expose them to exciting particle physics developments both in the US and in China. Students will actively participate in the Daya Bay experiment and present results to the collaboration in China and at conferences and meetings."
0.093102,"The goal of this project is to search for a new effect that is predicted to rotate small objects on the micro-scale without the use of traditional forces like gravity or electrostatics. According to quantum mechanics, i.e. the study of how nature works on the ultra-small-scale, ""empty space"" is actually teeming with activity. Even when all particles are removed from a region of space, fluctuating electromagnetic waves are found to persist. If two uncharged metal plates are brought near each other in ""empty space,"" these electromagnetic waves exert a force, which pushes the two plates together, much like two ships in choppy water. This force that pushes the metal plates together is known as the Casimir force, and is purely a result of quantum mechanics. Could the fluctuating fields in empty space cause objects to rotate? According to quantum mechanics, the answer is yes! For that, the objects need to have reflective properties that vary with orientation so that the force would cause these objects to rotate rather than just be pushed together. This rotation could be used to help design more efficient and useful micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), like the ones found in airbags and cell phones. The principal investigator aims to perform the first measurement of this rotational effect, the so-called Casimir torque, which will be carried out on a system consisting of liquid crystal molecules near a bulk crystal. In additional, this work will advance our understanding of quantum mechanics and our knowledge of how it can be used to improve small-scale devices, which have become ubiquitous.<br/><br/>When optically anisotropic materials are placed in close proximity, the boundary conditions imposed by the materials on the zero-point electromagnetic fluctuations will cause an angle dependent energy density. In order to minimize the total energy for the system, the objects will rotate. The principal investigator aims to measure the rotation of an optically anisotropic liquid crystal in close proximity to a birefringent plate using an all-optical measurement technique. Incident light will propagate through the liquid crystal, whose orientation is twisted as a result of the Casimir torque, and the final polarization state of the light will be measured upon exiting the system. The light intensity will be used to determine the torque experienced by the liquid crystal resulting from the Casimir torque at various separations from the birefringent plate. The separation is controlled by an isotropic spacer layer deposited between the birefringent crystal and the liquid crystal. The measurement technique avoids the need for detection of mechanical motion, which both simplifies the detection and improves the measurement sensitivity."
4.4,"Physicists' understanding of quantum mechanical phenomena has surpassed the stage of simple observation and measurement. Advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO) and condensed matter physics (CM) have enabled explorations into the control over quantum systems with a goal of achieving quantum engineering. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers award the Physics Frontiers Center at the Joint Quantum Institute (PFC@JQI) will build on research conducted during the previous award to study many-body physics by the controlling and monitoring of quantum complexity in a systematic way. This will be done by both the intricate building and examination of materials using a wide range of platforms spanning both AMO and CM. The PFC@JQI will continue to reach out to underrepresented groups through programs such as the Summer Girls Program which is a two-week intensive, hands-on physics program for high school students. The Center will also participate in other outreach and education programs geared to a range of audiences from the general public to K-12 students to graduate education.<br/><br/>The PFC@JQI will investigate experimental and theoretical areas related to quantum many-body physics at the interface of AMO and CM. Research areas will include: studies of topological matter (where energy bands determine the nature and behavior of the matter) such as Majorana fermion physics and new platforms for programmable topological matter; the use of quantum optical systems to explore many-body physics through coupling between, or mediated by, photons in atomic or photonic media; and the study of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of many-body interacting systems using atomic and condensed matter systems through a close collaboration of experimentalists and theorists."
0.2,"Researchers from University of Maryland, College Park, and University of California, Berkeley, plan to investigate atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) sources for modification of selected model biomolecules and to establish a scientific framework for development of atmospheric pressure plasma applications in biotechnology and plasma medicine (or biomedicine). Non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasmas are powerful sources for reactive chemical species that can have profound biological effects, but the sources are complex, poorly understood, and are difficult to design and control. Our knowledge of the nature of the plasma-biomaterial interaction using such atmospheric pressure plasma sources is especially inadequate. This work combines plasma source characterization/simulations, plasma-surface (tissue) treatments/in-situ surface characterization with biological assay methodologies, and various characterization approaches, including magnetic resonance characterization of solid state and solution macromolecules. The broader impacts of this project go beyond the establishment of baseline methodologies that can be used to characterize and control interactions of APP sources with biological targets. As an enabling technology, approaches and concepts unveiled in this work can be broadly applied in diverse applications where the biological environment must be well-controlled, e.g. disinfection of packaging for food and medicines, modification of biological systems, cells and tissue, including the field of plasma medicine. The principles under study in this project are also relevant to all applications of APP for surface functionalization of organic materials such as polymers.<br/><br/>The project's first objective is to obtain a fundamental understanding of how fluxes of reactive species produced in two representative APP devices depend on source type, operating parameters and environmental conditions using relevant chemistries. The second objective is to expose selected biomolecules to well controlled species from these APP sources to induce atomistic modifications of the biomolecules. The changes in biomolecule properties (chemical, morphological etc) along with alterations in biological function will be characterized using an array of complementary methods. Furthermore, modifications in biological function will be correlated with the results of the comprehensive materials/surface characterizations to provide underlying chemical and biological mechanisms. The third objective is to obtain a scientific understanding of how water modulates APP-biomolecule interactions to affect its biological function. This includes establishment of differences in APP species fluxes, chemical/morphological changes in biomolecules, and their biological responses to bio-assays when water is present either in the gas stream passing through the APP source, the environment (humidity) or as a liquid on the surface of the biomolecule. The fourth objective is experimental validation of current computational efforts on simulating atomic-scale modifications of specific model biomolecules by reactive species produced by APP sources. This will be based on investigating biomolecules for which atomic-scale simulations of the interaction of reactive plasma species with these biomolecules have either been published, or are currently ongoing."
0.465,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has.<br/><br/>In this project new analysis techniques will be applied in the search for ""Beyond the Standard Model"" new physics using data collected at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the LHC. The LHC is a premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator, operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. It is currently one of the foremost facilities for answering ""Beyond the Standard Model"" questions and studying the properties of the Higgs boson. The new technique, boosted jet algorithms, is a way of discovering the properties of primary quarks decaying from new particles such as the Higgs boson. The signature of quarks from a primary interaction in CMS is the formation of a large number of detected particles all flowing in approximately the same direction. This formation is known as a jet. Extracting jets from background and measuring the energy and precise direction of a jet requires sophisticated algorithms such as the boosted jet algorithm that will be used here. These quarks are difficult to detect because they are hidden in a background of particles coming from uninteresting decays, the so-called pile-up background. The quark jets of interest here are coming from the decay of new particles such as the Higgs boson and other as-yet undiscovered, but theoretically proposed, particles that decay to highly boosted (high kinetic energy) top quarks and di-boson resonances (WW, ZZ and WZ). The boosted jet algorithm and other related techniques are showing great promise in identifying boosted jets in the presence of high background and are being used productively in the analysis of CMS data.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work involves extending the coverage of the current outreach program at the University of Buffalo (UB) to engage the broader public in discussions of major results in particle physics, as well as to enliven particle physics for young students. This will be implemented based on similar events as the ""HiggsFest"" that the PI organized at UB."

The work proposed here will continue the pioneering effort that this group did in the discovery of the Higgs by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN. They have been a leader in the study of Higgs properties, and have developed important tools used by the community as a whole. The group led the work on the 4-lepton decay channel in the discovery of the Higgs. One of the innovations developed by this group is known as the Matrix Element Likelihood Approach (MELA), an analysis technique that allowed CMS to determine the quantum numbers of the Higgs. The work proposed here will expand that technique, applying it to the new higher energy data that will soon be delivered by the LHC and use it in new searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>This project would also support technical contributions to the operation of the CMS detector and to the study of new detector technology for high luminosity upgrades of the LHC.

The contributions to the study of detector upgrades are based on tools that were developed to support the present operation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The impact of the proposed research program reaches beyond the narrow definition of particle physics. The proposed work on active pixel detector technology has application to instrumentation used at synchrotron light sources to study materials and biological systems. The proposed research has a strong educational component. It provides direct support and training for a number of students. In particular, the testing of prototype detectors for future upgrades would provide a diversity of experiences that are not otherwise available to young scientists working in particle physics.

1.47,"This project will support five principal investigators, Kaustubh Agashe, Zackaria Chacko, S. James Gates Jr., Rabindra N. Mohapatra and Raman Sundrum, to continue their on-going theoretical investigations into the nature and origin of the constituents of matter and the forces operating between them as well as the possible existence of extra hidden space dimensions. The PIs will use existing mathematical tools developed for this purpose and seek new ones. They plan to study the nature of the Higgs boson, a major discovery of the past year in the field, the particle that gives mass to matter, and the possible existence of its companion particles that may be indicating any new symmetries or possibly giving mass to tiny particles filling the universe called the neutrinos. This is expected not only to broaden our understanding of the known subatomic phenomena but also in the process, discover new ones that can be tested in machines such as the Large Hadron Collider. The ultimate goal of this research is to seek a fundamental unity among the forces and matter and their impact on the evolution of the Cosmos. These investigations will throw light on such questions as the origin of matter and dark matter in the universe as well as the origin of dark energy and dark radiation. <br/><br/>The combination of big picture excitement,intellectual challenge and connections to diverse experiments makes this project an excellent training ground. The project is therefore weighted towards supporting two students and two postdocs.

The work in this project will be disseminated even more broadly through public and school lectures, and media broadcasts and interviews."
0.17,"This project is focused on the understanding of particle acceleration during the process of magnetic reconnection. Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in which magnetic energy is converted into high-speed flows and energetic particles. It underlies important phenomena in nature, including solar flares, strong disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field, and disruptions in laboratory fusion experiments. Magnetic reconnection is also the driver of space weather, which can negatively impact satellite communications and threaten astronauts in space. Great progress has been made on understanding the mechanisms for the fast release of magnetic energy seen in nature and the laboratory during magnetic reconnection. Solar observations suggest that a large fraction of the magnetic energy released appears in the form of energetic particles. The mechanisms for particle acceleration are not understood and are the focus of this research project. The project will include active involvement of undergraduate students, the training of graduate students, including female graduate students, and thus further the broad educational goals of NSF.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this research program is to understand electron and ion heating and acceleration during magnetic reconnection and to develop a model for particle acceleration that can be compared with observations. Particle-in-cell simulations and analytic approaches will be used to address four key issues related to electron and ion acceleration during magnetic reconnection: to identify and quantify the dominant mechanisms for electron acceleration; to establish the physics basis for the ubiquitous observations of power-law spectra of energetic particles; to establish the mechanism for ion acceleration and abundance enhancements in impulsive flares; and to develop a Fokker-Planck model of particle acceleration that can be used to predict the hazards associated with space weather. Collaborations will be continued with scientists working on laboratory experiments and with satellite data to benchmark the theoretical predictions with observations."

A small but theoretically observable flux of these ultra-high-energy neutrinos is expected to be produced by the interaction between high-energy ""cosmic ray"" charged particles and cosmic microwave background photons as the cosmic rays travel through the Universe. Observing these cosmogenic neutrinos would allow physicists to begin to study physics at energies beyond the standard models. The large volume of radio transparent ice covering the geographic South Pole in Antarctica has hosted several pioneering efforts to detect these high energies neutrinos using a radio Cherenkov ""Askaryan effect."" The Askaryan effect describes the process by which ultra-high-energy neutrinos traversing the dense polar ice generate observable radio waves. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located at the South Pole Station, was designed to exploit this phenomenon to first detect and ultimately study these ultra-high-energy neutrinos. This award provides funding to deploy two more ARA stations to the existing suite of three stations, and to continue observations. The award will support the involvement of students, including undergraduate students, who will be engaged in on-site activities at the South Pole.

0.16,"This research is focused on developing new methodologies for ultrafast imaging. In particular, it will contribute to a new development of ultrafast optical and X-ray cameras capable of providing molecular movies with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This will greatly advance ultrafast optical science in single-molecule imaging, light-matter interaction, and inertial confinement fusion. The project also includes educational activities such as developing a summer/winter short course in optical science for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as training one graduate and two undergraduate and/or local high school students per year in the PI's laboratory. The research also includes extensive educational activities for students in individual and collaborative research settings.<br/><br/>Conventional pump-probe methods can routinely provide ultrafast time-resolved imaging, but they mostly work for highly repeatable events. However, if event-to-event reproducibility is irregular or involves material damage, irreversible chemical reactions, and/or structural phase transition, single-shot detection is a necessity. The project here is to develop a single-shot camera capable of capturing ultrafast dynamic images, simultaneously recording spatial (2-dimensional) and temporal evolutions in a single-shot. Such a camera can capture images at a frame rate of ~50 trillion frames per second, recording 3 ~ 60 frames in a single-shot. Here, the enabling technologies include ultra-broadband spectrum generation, ultrafast optical pulse shaping, and single-shot hyperspectral imaging. This kind of camera can be potentially used in material characterization, biomedical imaging, bio-sensors, and optical and plasma diagnostics. In particular, its application in X-ray free electron lasers will lead to ultrashort electron beam imaging and characterization."

HAWC is under construction at an elevation of 4100 meters above sea level in Mexico by a collaboration of US and Mexican institutions. This award will fund operations that will begin in August 2013 even while construction is being completed. At the beginning of operations HAWC, with 100 Water Cherenkov Detectors, will be the most sensitive wide-field detector in the TeV range. During the first year of operation, HAWC's sensitivity will steadily increase as more detectors are brought online. When completed in the Fall of 2014 HAWC will consist of an array of the 250-300 detectors and will be more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than its predecessors. HAWC will monitor the northern sky and make coincident observations with other observatories including VERITAS, HESS, Magic, IceCube and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope for multi-wavelength and multi-messenger studies of the high-energy sky. HAWC will observe Galactic sources in the TeV energy range, detect diffuse emission from regions of the Galactic plane, observe known TeV active galactic nuclei and the brightest known gigaelectronvolt (GeV) gamma-ray bursts, and with its significant increase in sensitivity it is poised to discover new high-energy phenomena in the Universe.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: HAWC is an all-sky instrument that will serve as a TeV 'finder' telescope for ground-based observatories, and it can be used to extend measurements of satellite-discovered sources to TeV energies. HAWC will build on the strong outreach record of Milagro to bring the high-energy astrophysics field to students and the general public.

0.41,"This award supports an experimental research program that studies coherent photon-atom interactions in a coupled cavity-atom system consisting of multiple multi-level atoms interacting with one or two cavity modes and also with free-space laser fields. The experiments are carried out with laser-cooled rubidium atoms confined in an optical resonator. The prior work of the PI's group showed that the collective coupling of the cavity field and atoms can be used to produce the intra-cavity dark state and create cavity electromagnetically induced transparency. The PI's group also showed that the free-space laser field can be used to induce the destructive interference in the coupled cavity-atom system and control the quantum states of the cavity QED system. The planned experiments will use such interplay of the cavity QED and the quantum interference induced by the free-space laser fields to obtain large optical nonlinearities and to study light control light phenomena such as all-optical switching and large cross-phase modulation at ultra-low light intensities. The experiments will also be carried out in the cavity-atom system with a free-space, multi-frequency control light field that creates broadband electromagnetically induced transparency, which is useful for studies of a multichannel, broadband light memory. <br/><br/>The funded research will advance knowledge of the fundamental physics of photon-atom interactions, lead to discoveries of new phenomena, and result in the development of coherent optical techniques for applications in quantum state manipulation, spectroscopic measurements, light-control-light photonic devices, and storage and conversion of quantum information. The research activities are carried out at Florida International University (a minority institute) and involve contributions from graduate and undergraduate students, particularly minority students.

0.05,"Many of the deepest problems in theoretical physics revolve around combining Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum theory. The resulting theory is called ""quantum gravity"" and is needed to better understand the origin of the universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, and what happens inside black holes. The research supported by this award will use the latest techniques and tools to try to study quantum fluctuations and their effects, especially rare but large spontaneous fluctuations of energy density. These are subtle effects which are not well understood. The results of this research may have applications to other areas of science and possibly to technology. The large fluctuations to be studied may play a role in nonlinear optics and quantum tunneling, two areas which have broad applications. The project will also have educational benefits. Students will participate in the research and gain valuable experience from doing so. The project should also produce examples which can be used to explain some of the concepts of quantum theory and relativity to students on a variety of educational levels.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the probability distributions for quantum stress tensor fluctuations and their applications to gravity theory and other areas of physics. Particular attention will be paid to the asymptotic form of the distribution which governs the probability for large fluctuations. One approach to be used is the calculation of the large moments of the distribution. Preliminary studies indicate that this asymptotic form falls rather slowly compared to that for a thermal distribution. This indicates that quantum vacuum effects could dominate over thermal effects for large fluctuations, and suggests that new physical effects might be discovered in this line of research. Several models will be examined to look for such effects. One will be the effects of radiation pressure fluctuations on quantum tunneling of electrons and other particles. Another model will examine the effects of electric field fluctuations on the propagation of light in a nonlinear material. This study is of interest both for optical physics, and as an analog model for the quantum lightcone fluctuations expected in a quantum theory of gravity. The project will also examine the role of quantum stress tensor fluctuations in the early universe, especially in inflationary models."
0.045,"This award funds some of the research activities of Professor Ken D. Olum at Tufts University.<br/><br/>Cosmic strings are microscopically thin or even fundamental objects of cosmological length, which may or may not exist in our universe. Detection of cosmic strings would provide a window onto fundamental physics at energies beyond the reach of any accelerator. Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory. Professor Olum's research will advance our knowledge of the cosmic string network as it would exist today and would have existed in the past under any specific cosmic string theory. In particular, it will lead to accurate information about the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings. This information will allow us to determine the properties of the cosmic string network if such gravitational waves are detected in the future. If they are not detected, it will enable us to set limits on the possibilities for cosmic strings, and thus on underlying theories of high-energy physics. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of the universe. Professor Olum will also involve graduate students in the work and thus train future generations of research physicists. The work will further connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Olum will study the shape of cosmic string loops to determine how many cusps they have and to calibrate the signals that they might produce for comparison with observational limits on gravitational waves from pulsar timing. He will also study networks that might arise from cosmic strings with a low probability of reconnection when they intersect each other, as might be found in cosmic superstring theories."

It is anticipated that this project will lead to the discovery of new types of experimental signals that can be probed at the LHC, including different types of displaced vertices and fractionally charged particles. Additionally, Professor Graham will design a new type of dark-matter detector. While a large number of experiments are searching for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter, it is very difficult to search for the equally well-motivated axion dark matter, and indeed most of the allowed parameter space for axion dark matter remains unreachable by current experiments. Professor Graham will propose new signals of axions and axion-like particles, including a time-oscillating nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM), and will design a detector based on nuclear magnetic resonance technology to search for this oscillating EDM. <br/><br/>This project will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Graham will be actively involved in science education, including designing curricula and courses for undergraduate and graduate students. He will also have significant involvement with K-12 physics education. Professor Graham has developed strong connections with several local public elementary schools and will work actively on promoting awareness and understanding of modern topics in physics research. This includes directly educating the students and teachers, running labs in the classroom, and giving tours of modern physics laboratories. Professor Graham will also work actively with graduate students and postdocs on research, training them to become theoretical particle physicists. He will also continue to make connections with other subfields of physics, including astrophysics, atomic physics, and condensed-matter physics, bringing closer collaboration amongst these different fields."
0.09,"This project will continue a code development for accurate calculations of atomic properties relevant, for instance, to studies of fundamental interactions, analysis of astrophysical data, plasma science, studies of quantum degenerate gases and production of ultracold molecules, atomic clock research, and quantum information, the latter two of which have important applications to modern communication systems. In all these areas, accurate theoretical methods in atomic, molecular and optical physics are indispensable to the design and interpretation of experiments, especially when the direct experimental measurement of relevant parameters is not feasible. The end-goal of this project is to elevate the treatment of complicated atoms to the same level of accuracy that is afforded currently only to simpler systems, thus opening up much of the Periodic Table to applications that heretofore could only be pursued with the simplest atoms. The code package will be documented and made available to the scientific community as an open-source code that will be suitable for the use by the non-expert in many-body theory.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to continue the development of a broadly applicable and accurate code for predicting properties of open d- and f-shell atoms. This code is based on the combination of configuration interaction and all-order linearized coupled-cluster methods (CI+all-order) and the code will be documented and made available to the scientific community. The present CI+all-order implementation does not include the quantum electrodynamics (QED) correction. Owing to recent advances in the development of model QED potentials, QED can be incorporated into both the coupled-cluster and configuration interactions parts of the method. As many plasma and astrophysics applications require the properties of the highly-charged ions, this development will significantly expand the code applicability."
0.72,"This project is a fundamental experimental study of waves, transport, nonequilibrium fluctuations, and viscoelastic behavior in strongly coupled dusty plasmas. Strongly coupled plasmas are ionized gases in which the interparticle potential energy is greater than the particle kinetic energy. They behave like a crystal or liquid, unlike the more familiar weakly coupled plasmas, which behave like a gas. A dusty plasma is a four-component mixture of micron-size particles of solid matter, electrons, ions, and neutral gas. The solid particles become charged due to collecting electrons and ions. The electric field in a plasma sheath can levitate these charged particles against gravity, allowing the confinement of 1D, 2D or 3D clouds of particles. A particle's charge is large, typically Q = -10,000 electronic charges, so that pairs of particles have a large interparticle repulsion. The large potential energy of this repulsion, together with a cooling of particles by gas drag, lead to strong coupling among the particles. By tailoring the manipulation and confinement of the particles, experiments are performed to study a variety of physical phenomena in statistical mechanics, transport and nonlinear waves. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this project includes: cross-cutting research topics of interest to a wide range of physics disciplines, outreach, training of graduate and undergraduate students, and broad dissemination of results."
0.02871,"The goal of the project supported by this award is to create new computer programs to calculate the interactions and properties of systems of three nucleons (atomic number A=3) using the most general form of interactions allowed by the physical laws of nature. These new computer programs will be made publicly available, thereby allowing other researchers to explore different parameters of the interaction or different interactions without the need to write the intricate computer programs needed to explore a three-nucleon system. A main motivation for this study is to understand the complex interactions between protons and neutrons in the nucleus; however the computational techniques used can also be applied to other areas of physics where three-body interactions are present, such as atomic physics (research with cold atoms) and particle physics (quark interactions inside the proton).<br/><br/>The method of predicting the behavior of three or more interacting bodies is a long-standing problem in theoretical physics. While the interactions of two particles are fairly easy to calculate, the so-called three-body problem is much more difficult to solve. A method attributed to Faddeev is now widely used, but the implementation of the Faddeev equations requires long and involved calculations that are best suited for powerful computers. The traditional approach to calculating the Faddeev equations uses a mathematical technique called partial-wave expansion. However, as the energy increases in the three-body system, this mathematical technique becomes inefficient. The current project utilizes a novel mathematical approach of taking spin traces, which allows the three-body problem to be solved at much higher energies, and generally increases the flexibility of implementing a wider class of inter-particle forces. Hence, this project will provide a better theoretical framework for the investigation of the three-body problem than is presently feasible."
6.56,"This proposal is a renewal proposal for the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC), led by the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT). The overall aim of the project is to build the capacity of the nation to produce more highly-qualified physics and physical science teachers, and thus address the critical shortage of qualified physics and physical science secondary teachers in the U.S. The goals of the project are to: demonstrate and provide sustainable models for a) increasing the number of highly qualified high school physics teachers and b) improving the quality of K-8 physical science teacher education; advocate for improving teacher education within the physics community, and spread best practice ideas through a coalition of institutions committed to this work; and work directly with physics departments to engage them in educating teachers, targeting areas of critical need. Project sites will adopt best practices in teacher education, including researched curricula and methods shown to increase student learning, and research-validated assessment tools to measure important aspects of teacher quality. The sites will collect and report data on teacher production, teacher quality and teacher retention, as well as implementation of program elements and innovations. Collaborative working relationships with prominent physics education researchers have been developed who will lead scholarly investigations to answer research questions in teacher education and advise the project on assessment activities. The project will use surveys as a formative evaluation of conferences, workshops, and other activities. Teachers from PhysTEC institutions and from outside the project will benefit from mentoring and professional development provided by Teachers-In-Residence and local Teacher Advisory Groups. With a combined membership of over 50,000 physics professionals, the APS and AAPT, through this project, will disseminate knowledge on teacher education to its members, and through conferences and workshops for PTEC Coalition institutions."
0.098442,"Non-technical description:<br/>This project involves an investigation of how two of the smallest and most fundamental constituents of matter (electrons) exchange information with each other (the analog of ""talking"") when they are transferred from one atom to another as the two atoms move by each other quickly. In the process to be studied, the two electrons come from a target atom and are captured by a fast moving projectile ion (an atom missing some electrons on it initially) accompanied by the emission of a single x ray. The process can be thought of as the inverse of the double ionization (removal of two electrons) by a single photon. This two-electron process is similar to the one-electron process in which an electron is liberated by a single photon. The latter process is known as the photoelectric effect, which was explained by Einstein in 1905, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and which underlies much of modern technology. During the two-electron process the electrons ""talk"" with each other and coordinate the double photo-ionization. The same must occur in the time-reversed case when two electrons are transferred to a projectile, giving up a photon. There is considerable interest in studying this ""talking"" process, from the point of view of collisions between ions and target atoms and from the time-reversed process of double photo-ionization of an atom by a single photon. Theorists have calculated probabilities for the two-electron process, with results differing by factors of 1,000 or even 10,000. This wide range leaves the field open for experiments that will determine the actual probability accurately. Up to now, five experiments of two-electron transfer with simultaneous emission of a photon have been attempted at laboratories in the U.S. and Germany. One of these experiments (in the U.S.) was partially successful, but the others were not, mostly due to the long measuring times required to see the events. Notably, photon collision researchers would be very much interested in measuring double photo-ionization of two-electron ions, something they cannot yet do, except for the two-electron atom helium. The involvement of Ph.D. students in the planned research gives them valuable training in state-of-the-art physics experiments, and along with the preparation of collaborative manuscripts and abstracts, help make them productive young scientists.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The transfer of two electrons to an ion accompanied by the emission of a single photon is called radiative-double-electron capture, or RDEC for short. The intellectual merit of RDEC lies in its intrinsic fundamental interest in the field of ion collisions with quasi-free electrons, and its close relationship to photon interactions with highly-charged ions. This relationship is essentially the time inverse of RDEC, which is the process of double photo-ionization of ions. These inverse processes are particularly connected when RDEC occurs for incident fully-stripped ions and double photo-ionization for two-electron systems. RDEC has been investigated sparsely, and new studies will address complications of the previous data involving ion-solid interactions for oxygen and fluorine ions incident on a C foil, and will build upon these results by investigating RDEC for collisions with gas targets of He, N2 and Ne. An advantage of gas targets is that they do not introduce the effects of multiple collisions present for solid targets and the results are expected to clarify the questions that arose in the earlier work. RDEC can be compared with several theoretical calculations that differ by several orders of magnitude. By obtaining results for C-foil targets and for gas targets, both to be studied under this project, and by comparing the measurements with theory, it should be possible to obtain the first data that provides input to the theoretical calculations. The measurements will be done for fully-stripped fluorine ions using the tandem Van de Graaff at Western Michigan University. The particular apparatus for the proposed experiment, including the apparatus for the gaseous targets, is already in place (funded previously by the US DOE). Measurements will involve recording coincidences between x rays emitted and singly- and doubly-charged projectiles (the latter coincidences represent a signature for RDEC). The measurements are difficult due to the relatively small cross sections for RDEC (on the order of ~1 barn or less) and will require long counting times of more than a month."
2.055,"This work supports research focused on data analysis, operations and upgrades for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), while leveraging the synergies of the group's efforts in software and computing (including hosting a Tier-2 center) and the planned upgrade of the forward pixel detector. The group will continue analyzing data recorded in 2011 and 2012, participate in construction of the upgraded pixel detector, prepare for the restart of the LHC in 2015, and then analyze the first data from 13 TeV collisions. The UNL group's physics interests include studies of the Higgs, the top quark, electroweak, QCD and B physics, plus searches for new phenomena. The group has an outreach program centered around the Cosmic Ray Observatory Project (CROP). The UNL group has also established a growing network of 29 high-school cosmic-ray research teams, studying extensive air showers in Nebraska with student-built and operated detectors, and future growth will focus on underserved rural populations. They also run a Bilingual English Speaking Tutors (BEST) program that engages 70 bilingual elementary school students and high school tutors each year, generating measurable improvements in student achievement, and a significant expansion is planned during this period."
0.02,"The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Protein Folding Dynamics ""Folding: The Landscapes of Natural and Synthetic Life"" will be held at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas, January 10-15, 2016. The meeting will bring together senior scientists, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students from a wide range of interests and approaches to protein folding dynamics. The nature of the conference allows close interaction among participants, who can share their ideas and results. By bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics and biology to explore recent exciting developments in this field in a concrete forum that encourages open discussions from researchers working on different systems, the new paradigm of cross-disciplinary research is strengthened.<br/><br/>The conference will assemble experimentalists and theoreticians to discuss basic issues in protein folding dynamics and their role in function, in the evolution of protein sequences and in disorders associated with protein misfolding. It has become increasingly clear that understanding the details of protein folding dynamics is crucial in describing virtually all processes of life, including protein synthesis, co-translational folding, protein allostery, protein function and diseases related to protein misfolding. The conference will cover a range of topics namely in vitro and in vivo folding, protein aggregation, protein evolution and design, and the role of protein dynamics in function. The 2016 conference is expanding to include complete formal sessions on protein evolution and the folding of non-biological foldamers and even complete chromosomes. This expansion was partly in response to requests from previous years' participants but also the current organizers believed that extending the range of topics would add to the intellectual merit of the conference. Participants will able to spend time together over a week of talks and presentations, thus allowing synergy of ideas and identification and solutions of a variety of problems."
0.28,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the mass of the Higgs boson has the value it has. To answer these questions it is necessary to go beyond the present picture of the Universe described by the Standard Model to the next phase of development, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Investigations in BSM physics probe such questions as why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. This project, which uses the Mu2e detector at Fermilab, will search for BSM physics through the precision measurement of the energy of electrons produced by the decay of muons. The broader impact of this work, in addition to contributions to the scientific collaborations, includes student engagement at Northern Illinois University, public outreach and service, and technology development through generation of patents and the development of technology usable for medical imaging. Undergraduate and graduate students from both physics and engineering participate in all aspects of this research. Technology developed by the R&D program has expanded techniques available for calorimetry and is currently being used for Mu2e and for a second generation proton tomography device, and has led to two patents with a third under consideration.<br/><br/>Searches for evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model can be addressed through direct searches at the Energy Frontier at High Energy Colliding Beam Facilities such as the LHC and through a complementary technique of indirect searches at the Intensity Frontier, in experimental measurements of rare processes such the subject of this award, the decay of a muon into an electron. In the SM such a decay is very rare, but certain BSM physics models, such as SuperSymmetry(SUSY) , predict a higher rate of this decay. In this award, the researchers will use the Mu2e detector at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). This experiment uses a very intense beam of protons to produce a muon beam which traverses a series of magnets and impinges on a target where the muons are stopped and are captured by Aluminum atoms in the target. After a short period of time, the muons then decay to electrons and if the decay is a direct decay to an electron (with no neutrino) the electron has a unique characteristic energy. The challenge of this experiment is to measure the electron energy very precisely. If the electron energy distribution is correct, it will show evidence of the direct muon to electron decay and provide evidence that there is BSM physics."
2.967108,"This award provides support for a consortium of three universities to build a custom electronics system called the Fast TracKer (FTK) for the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The FTK will perform global track recognition reconstruction using the innovative technique of massive parallelism. A billion track patterns are pre-stored in custom content-addressable memory (Associative Memory) chips that are being designed. As each hit leaves the detector at full speed, it is simultaneously seen by all patterns. Track fitting is replaced by a linear calculation of the track parameters and the goodness of fit, with nearly offline resolution. With modern electronics, one can fit tracks at a rate of one track per nanosecond. <br/><br/>For the next decade, experiments at the LHC will provide unprecedented opportunities for answering the most important questions in elementary particle physics. Data collected by ATLAS will be used for hundreds of simultaneous analyses to search for the Higgs boson, supersymmetry, large extra dimensions, dark matter, Hidden Valley particles, the carriers of new forces, and other possible new phenomena as well as measure the detailed properties of the top and bottom quarks and the W and Z bosons in an attempt to understand what is beyond the Standard Model. Important discoveries are likely, but determining what the new phenomena are will not be easy. Large numbers of signal events are needed for such measurements, with as little background as possible. Tracking is essential for selecting events containing heavy fermions. At such luminosity, where large occupancy in the tracking detectors greatly increases track reconstruction time, only a small fraction of the events selected by the level-1 trigger could have track reconstruction done. The FTK, on the other hand, does global tracking three orders of magnitude more quickly than software reconstruction. As a result, it will enhance the physics reach for a broad range of ATLAS studies increasing the number of events retained for offline analysis by a factor of ten or more for broad classes of possible new phenomena. This means that if the new physics is dominated by such processes, ATLAS will be able to collect as many signal events in a year with much improved signal-to-background as it would without the FTK in a decade at the same luminosity. <br/><br/>This system is not only crucial for the ATLAS experiment, advancing the physics program of over 3000 scientists world-wide with 600 in the U.S., including over 200 graduate students from 40 institutions, but will also promote innovations in detector technology. The university groups in this proposal have a tradition for involving undergraduate and graduate students in detector development projects and this project will bring unique opportunities for training and teaching modern electronics and computing to a variety of levels of young people. It will be one of the most sophisticated systems built in high energy physics. Under the supervision of professors and engineers, graduate students and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, will collaborate in designing, building, and testing electronic boards, writing the firmware and software, and comparing to simulation - all marketable skills. Two of the five PIs are female thereby promoting diversity. This extremely fast pattern recognition technology that would be developed for the FTK could have a profound impact on all future versions of collider and astrophysics experiments as well as applications to other field such as medical imaging. As an example, in proton computed tomography the pattern recognition technology has the potential to increase data acquisition rates and thus reduce imaging time with improved resolution."

The managing institution for LIGO itself is California Institute of Technology. The project is the continuation of the LIGO Science Education Center Partnership focused on scientific outreach to the general public, teacher training, and teacher education focused on LIGO activities in Louisiana. A previous award helped create the SEC building, with a classroom and a large exhibit hall, with exhibits developed by the Exploratorium and staffed by SUBR student docents and a (separately funded) professional staff. The multilayered partnership of HBCUs, a cutting edge research facility and a renowned informal science center created a model for future partnerships. With the expansion of this partnership the model is extended, and research on the effects of these extensive partnerships can provide information for future attempts at leveraging the resources of research laboratories for educational purposes.<br/><br/>This project will use the LIGO-SEC Partnership to amplify and nurture a Science, Technology, Engineering, Education and Mathematics (STEEM) pipeline that taps into under-represented audiences and engages them in techniques that encourage students to advance their education in STEEM fields. The docent program and the teacher programs will increase participation of under-represented audiences within the STEEM fields. The docent program will train between sixty and eighty under-represented STEEM majors to become community ambassadors in conjunction with LIGO Science Education Center's outreach program, and the docents will interact with between 12,500 and 5,000 participants. The teacher professional development activities target high-need areas in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The activities will develop around 250 teachers' familiarity with engineering design processes and underlying science concepts. These teachers will create and build interactive science activities to use in the classroom to engage with students. Graduate students will conduct new research in the use of inquiry and informal science methods within the formal (School) and informal (LIGO-SEC) environments. The graduate students' dissertations will contribute to the literature on Informal Science Education. The project is guided by an on-going evaluation."

This system consists of an ultracold quantum gas strongly coupled to the optical and mechanical modes of a microtoroidal resonator. The project brings together concepts of micro-electromechanical systems engineering, nanofabrication and atomic physics to forge a hybrid quantum system for the quantum-limited control, manipulation and readout of an innovative optomechanical device. The transformative nature of this device includes pushing the frontier of ultra-cold atom trapping and manipulation at sub-microKelvin temperatures, exploiting the nature of optomechanical systems by providing a new tool for the measurement, manipulation and study of quantum properties of macroscopic mechanical modes and, ultimately, developing an important new technology for sensors that could lead to unprecedented precision for a rotation sensor that would, for example, significantly improve gyroscopes.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this program is the realization of a strongly coupled quantum system that combines the coherence and sensitivity of ultracold atomic gases with the robustness of a micromechanical device. The successful demonstration of such hybrid systems is one of the most significant open challenges in quantum information science and sensor technology. The architecture under study paves the way for a systematic study of key scientific issues including the ability of a quantum gas to control and enhance the sensitivity of micro-electromechanical force sensors.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this program is the unification of powerful concepts from the intellectually distinct domains of Electromechanical device engineering and ultracold atomic physics. In addition to answering fundamental questions regarding the interaction of quantum systems with macroscopic mechanical systems, the proposed system is an enabling technology for applications including inertial navigation systems, compact integrated frequency standards, ultrasensitive force sensors and quantum information science."

0.5,"With this award, Professor Lannon will pursue a five-year plan to study the production of the Higgs boson in association with top quark pairs. Initial efforts will be directed toward the measurement of top pair production cross sections using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, followed by studies on top pair plus jets production. Ultimately, he hopes to progress to a study of Higgs produced with a top pair. To further this long-term research goal, this award includes support for research and development activities aimed at upgrading the CMS trigger to add information from the tracking system that is not currently used in the trigger. Finally, this award allows Professor Lannon to take advantage of a unique educational activity related to his research. The CMS collaboration has agreed to make a small fraction of the data it collects available to QuarkNet, an outreach program in high energy physics research involving high school students and teachers. Along with a colleague at Notre Dame, Lannon plans to create the necessary infrastructure for data collected by the QuarkNet trigger to be used by QuarkNet participants. Achieving this goal would create a long-term infrastructure that would allow high school students and teachers to share in the experience of doing cutting-edge high energy physics research. This infrastructure can be built upon by future efforts to bring this experience to students of all backgrounds, economic situations, and geographical locations through the use of web-based learning and collaboration tools."

Data from the LHC is likely to lead to nothing less than a new Standard Model for the next generation of particle physicists, describing the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at an even higher energy scale. In his research, Professor Anchordoqui aims to develop methods by which a certain class of new theories beyond the Standard Model might be tested at the LHC. This class of new theories includes those in which the myriad of particle types in the Standard Model is replaced by a single fundamental building block: a ""string."" One critical component of Anchordoqui's work is to explore the various properties of string resonances related to experimental searches for new physics at the LHC.

This research project will utilize the techniques of gauge/gravity duality to get insights into quantum properties of black holes and into dynamics of strongly-coupled gauge theories. The first part of the project will focus of resolving the black hole information paradox by identifying the microscopic states contributing to the entropy of various black holes and by studying their dynamics. The second part of the project will focus on understanding dynamics of strongly--coupled gauge theories by studying the dual description in terms of classical geometries. <br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Specifically, Professor Lunin will give lectures to high school students in the Albany area to inspire the students to consider careers in STEM and to prepare them for entering these quantitative fields. In addition, Professor Lunin will organize annual physics competitions, which will help the students to sharpen their problem-solving skills. He will also mentor graduate students and provide career advice to undergraduates."
0.258942,"The structure of the eight-dimensional parameter space for gravitational waves produced by binary black hole mergers is largely unknown. For each parameter value, each solution is found from numerically solving Einstein's equations and involves time intensive large-scale simulations. Hence, it is prohibitively expensive to explore the parameter space with traditional methods, which ultimately limits progress in gravitational waves physics and presents an important scientific challenge for the experimental program at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). In this project, new reduced-order modeling techniques will be developed for accurately representing solutions of parameterized problems that are expensive to solve for numerically, specifically in the context of gravitational waves from black hole binary mergers. <br/><br/>The results of this research project will enable the scientific community to make significant progress in the ability to map the continuum of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence for gravitational wave detection purposes.

0.692927,"This NSF-MRI allows generating milli-Joule (mJ) level, few-cycle pulses (10 fs to 14 fs) in the mid-infrared (1400-2200 nm) spectral region that are carrier-envelope phase stable. To generate these pulses, a white-light seeded optical parametric amplifier (OPA) is pumped by a 20 mJ femtosecond laser. The pulses emerging from the OPA are then spectrally broadened and compressed. Such capabilities are at the forefront of current ultrafast physics and attosecond science, opening a window for new and exciting studies in the general area of laser-matter interaction.<br/><br/>Extending these pulses to the mid-IR should enhance high-harmonic generation -- an effort presently pursued at just a handful of laboratories around the world. Driving the harmonics with these longer wavelengths will lead to a higher photon flux and energy. This high photon flux is critical for studies of non-linear UV/XUV phenomena as well as for extending our studies to the more complex systems of interest for most applications. The longer wavelength driving laser will also enable the investigation of electronic dynamics using a very different, rather unorthodox, approach. Namely, by taking advantage of the fact that dissociation in some molecules is an almost perfect analog of ionization in atoms, only few femtosecond laser pulses are required since nuclei move much slower than electrons. These pulses must, however, have long wavelengths to produce a measurable signal. In addition to the science advances, technological advances such as shaping attosecond pulses to eliminate their natural chirp or tailoring them to drive specific dynamics will be pursued. Such capabilities would be a substantial accomplishment and would, in turn, enable further scientific advances since scientific and technological breakthroughs go hand-in-hand in this field.<br/><br/>Measuring the dynamics of and controlling electrons in matter are major themes that extend throughout much of atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics, chemistry, materials science, and even biology today. In fact, the first of the five ""Grand Challenges for Basic Energy Science,"" as identified in the Department of Energy's special BESAC report in 2007, is ""How do we control material processes at the level of electrons?"" This theme appeared again in the National Research Council's ""Physics 2010"" report where the AMO contribution was entitled ""Controlling the Quantum World."" To accomplish these goals, laser pulses on the order of tens of attoseconds (1 as = 10^-18 s) are required. Such pulses are a challenge to produce, but by using high-harmonic generation (HHG), pulses below 100 as have been obtained in a few leading labs around the world, including here at the J. R. Macdonald Laboratory (JRML). This technological breakthrough has given birth to the field of attosecond science, which is presently one of the hottest in AMO physics. <br/><br/>This project will employ these attosecond UV/XUV pulses to study atomic and molecular dynamics as well as to probe more complex condensed matter systems. In addition, by observing the HHG spectra and/or emitted electrons, structural changes in molecules can be observed as they happen, deepening our understanding of the underlying dynamics and thereby taking an important step in controlling chemical reactions at the quantum mechanical level.<br/><br/>Beyond the technical and scientific impacts, this grant significantly impacts a large number of young scientists through hands-on training of the roughly seven postdocs, sixteen graduate students, and five undergraduate students hosted by the JRML. While the training opportunities mainly benefit graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, they also have an impact on undergraduate students through, for instance, the Physics Department's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program funded by the NSF. However, this laser source has also created a very broad collaboration between participants from institutions in three EPSCoR states who are currently funded primarily by NSF and DOE. The institutions involved are Kansas State University, Louisiana State University, Augustana College (an undergraduate institution in South Dakota), and the University of Kansas. The JRML group will leverage this new laser system to initiate additional collaborations following this model."
0.353999,"String theory provides consistent high-energy extrapolations of theoretical models of particle physics, as well as naturally unifying those models with gravity, and provides tools of mathematical physics with a number of applications in theoretical physics. One promising type of string theory model known as F-theory has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years which points out the need for some basic foundational studies. These studies involve a sophisticated branch of mathematics, algebraic geometry, which provides the background for constructing the physical models. The PI will determine what are the restrictions for gauge groups and matter content for F-theory models, both on Calabi-Yau threefolds and Calabi-Yau fourfolds; whether every elliptically-fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold is birational to an equidimensional family, and if not, what is the physical interpretation of the fibers of large dimension; the structure of the base of an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifold; the F-theory interpretation of Calabi-Yau manifolds which have a genus one fibration that is not elliptic (i.e., there is no section); how the birational geometry of the total space of an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold interacts with the choices of flux on that fourfold, and in particular, to what extent F-theory vacua are necessarily lifted by fluxes; the M-theory dual interpretation of the theory of T-branes; can the duality between F-theory and nongeometric heterotic strings be extended; and other topics in Calabi-Yau geometry which may be relevant to F-theory, including further exploration of the recent discovery that the gauged linear sigma models which describe Calabi-Yau manifolds contain via a partition function on S2 a wealth of information about the Calabi-Yau manifold. <br/>Broader Impact <br/>The project will also have a broader impact through educational activities of the PI, at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, as well as through the PI's ongoing efforts to streamline scientific communication by making as much of it available electronically as possible."
0.98,"This research project will focus on a number of areas related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Experiment: 1) co-leading the ongoing collaboration search for continuous gravitational waves; 2) developing new algorithms for detecting quasi-periodic sources from both isolated and binary neutron stars and 3) detector characterization of Advanced LIGO interferometers focused on spectral line identification and mitigation. The work to be carried out thus includes both searching in existing LIGO data for evidence of rapidly spinning, non-axisymmetric neutron stars in our galactic neighborhood and preparations for searches in the far more sensitive data expected from Advanced LIGO.<br/><br/>Discovery of gravitational waves from astrophysical objects will mark a major milestone in science, simultaneously confirming one of the fundamental predictions of gravitational physics, while opening up an entirely new field of astronomy. The detection of such waves from rotating neutron stars would be especially interesting because many such sources are expected to continue emitting for long durations, allowing follow-up investigation of increasing precision, and because it is believed that these waves will provide insight into the poorly known structure of these exotic stars. The research to be carried out, on both the instrumental and analytical sides, will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art science at the frontier of knowledge."
0.54,"This project is devoted to research by the University of Michigan Fundamental Neutron Physics Group on two fundamental-neutron-physics measurements: 1) measurement of the neutron lifetime with precision of approximately one second using a cold-neutron beam at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) and 2) measurement of the beta-neutrino correlation with the Nab/abBA/PANDA spectrometer at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). These are two of the five highest priority experiments identified in recommendations by a recent NSAC review of the field. The physics has broad impact across the fields of nuclear and particle physics and astrophysics. Both efforts enjoy strong collaborations and the support of the community as well as the scrutiny of critical reviews. The University of Michigan group has key technical and leadership roles in both efforts. <br/><br/>At NIST, we will perform an absolute calibration of the neutron-flux monitor used in the proton-trap measurement of the neutron lifetime. The proton-trap apparatus was used the most recent beam-lifetime measurement with the result for the lifetime of (886.3 +/- 1.2 (stat) +/- 3.2(sys)) seconds, where the systematic error is dominated by uncertainties related to the neutron-flux monitor calibration. The flux-monitor calibration campaign includes two independent calibrations using a monochromatic neutron beam at NIST and thick targets of Boron-10 or liquid Helium-3. For the Boron-10 approach, alpha particles and gamma rays are counted, and a set of measurements has recently been completed that demonstrated internal consistency and precision that would reduce the systematic error to about 0.5 sec. For the Helium-3 approach, the heat generated by the charged particles in the 3He(n,p)3H reaction is measured calorimetrically and converted to a neutron flux. The calorimeter approach, originally developed by our group, has been shown to be capable of measuring the flux to 0.1 % with 10 hours of integration. A number of improvements specifically related to the challenges of the liquid Helium-3 target have been completed at the University of Michigan, and the device will be moved to NIST with the aim of completing the calibration campaign by 2013 and undertaking the new proton-trap lifetime measurement on the new NIST NGC beam line in 2014.<br/><br/>The Nab spectrometer and experiment is to measure the beta-neutrino correlation at SNS. The magnetic-field-expansion spectrometer is designed to measure proton-electron coincidences using proton time-of-flight spectroscopy to extract the a parameter. It may also be possible to extract the Fierz interference b from electron spectroscopy in silicon detectors. The envisioned continuing physics program with the Nab spectrometer and polarized neutrons (abBA/PANDA) is extremely rich with the ability to over constrain V-A parameters for neutron decay and thus probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The University of Michigan group is responsible for all aspects of neutron polarization and polarimetry beginning, for Nab, by measuring the neutron polarization of the unpolarized FP-13 beam with sensitivity to the polarization of less than 0.01%.<br/><br/>The neutron is a sub-atomic particle that comprises more than half of the matter in the world. Within the nuclei of most atoms, the neutron remains stable, but when freed from the nucleus, it is unstable. Free neutrons are an important tool for study of sub-atomic physics, because the decay and interactions of free neutrons reveal the interactions of its constituents and decay products. Neutrons also have spin, the quantum mechanical property of the most fundamental pieces of matter that distinguishes two states called spin-up and spin-down. Spin is responsible for the nuclear magnetism exploited, for example, in NMR and MRI. The spin states also affect the decay and interactions of neutrons, and so the control of neutron spin becomes useful for more detailed study of sub-atomic interactions. This project envisions a program to incisively and carefully advance both the precision and the accuracy of the neutron lifetime and the correlation of electron and neutrino momenta in neutron decay. <br/><br/>The neutron lifetime is a measured fundamental quantity that impacts physics from the formation of the elements to the solar energy cycle to the structure of the Standard-Model of the weak interaction. Discrepancies among recent measurements have actually led to reduced confidence in the value of the neutron lifetime, and a new measurement using different techniques is essential to resolving the discrepancies. The measurement of the neutron lifetime using a cold neutron beam will provide a different approach, and accurate measurement of the neutron flux is crucial to the experiment. The neutron flux will be measured with a detector that has sensitivity that scales in the same way as the detection of neutron decays, but which must be calibrated by an absolute method. Absolute calibration will be achieved by measuring the heat produced when the neutrons are absorbed by Helium-3 in a cryogenic target at two degrees above absolute zero. The goal of this calibration is to provide an accurate neutron-flux measurement and determine the neutron lifetime with one-second precision.<br/><br/>The angle between the electron and neutrino produced in neutron decay is sensitive to the fundamental strength of the weak interaction when combined with the neutron lifetime. A broader class of measurements using polarized neutron can be used to probe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. A new spectrometer designed to measure both the proton and electron energies in neutron decay will first measure the electron-neutrino correlation and then be used with polarized neutrons.<br/><br/>This work probes deep intellectual questions about the most fundamental pieces of matter. The aim is to collect data that will help complete the picture of elementary particles and their interactions. The techniques have much broader impact. Laser polarized Helium-3 used to polarize neutrons has applications to materials science, and quantum information research. This project is a remarkable training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and post doctoral fellows. The technical challenges combined with the deep intellectual issues provide motivation and develop technical skills. Undergraduates will gain research experience working along with graduate and post doctoral fellows. Graduate students emerge broadly capable and move on to prepare for faculty or national lab positions as well as interdisciplinary research. This work has also led to development of new courses for non-physics majors, to a set of public lectures on Nuclear Magnets and Neutrinos and leadership in communicating science to the interested general population. In the context of probing fundamental problems of physics, exciting in its own right, the hardest problems produce the most innovative solutions with spin-offs unimaginable at the outset. Atomic clocks, enhanced MRI, and experiments that probe the origin of matter all follow from the control of nuclear magnetism and neutron spins."
0.51,"Physicists at the University of Michigan are useing ""ponderomotive spectroscopy,"" an advanced form of a technique that traces back at least to the 17th century when Isaac Newton first showed that white light sent through a prism breaks into a rainbow. The new high-resolution spectroscopy allows the researchers to peer more deeply into the structure of atoms and direct their behavior at a much finer scale. The measurements made possible by ponderomotive spectroscopy could thus lead to advances in fundamental physics and promote the progress of science. In their research, the scientists use Rydberg atoms--giant atoms that exhibit not only greater size, but also stronger interactions than usual atoms. Rydberg atoms enable the new method of ponderomotive spectroscopy. In addition, they allow for the detection of small electromagnetic fields, which may improve our ability to measure natural or human activity, as well as investigate how systems of quantum-mechanical matter (matter that behaves like waves) interact with each other.<br/><br/>In detail, the researchers employ a spectroscopic method in which highly excited Rydberg atoms are prepared in a modulated optical-lattice laser trap. Laser-cooled ground-state atoms are excited into Rydberg levels within the optical lattice. The lattice field holds on to the tenuously bound Rydberg electron via the ponderomotive light-electron interaction, which in turn results in a trapping force for the entire atom. Time-dependent microwave modulation of the trapping field then drives transitions between Rydberg-atom levels whose energies are separated by odd harmonics of the modulation frequency. The frequency-resolution and accuracy limits of lattice modulation spectroscopy are explored. The method is employed to measure atomic quantities, such as quantum defects, ionic polarizabilities and the Rydberg constant. Using a cavity-generated, very deep implementation of the Rydberg-atom lattice, the energies of strongly mixed Rydberg adiabatic states are measured. Other measurement objectives are the polarizabilities of low-lying atomic levels and light propagation in the densely filled cold-atom channels present in the cavity-generated optical lattice. In a second research component, the trajectories of Rydberg-atom pairs are measured using a direct atom imaging technique, which is based on Rydberg-atom field ionization, ion extraction and spatial imaging. The trajectory measurements reveal interatomic forces and their anisotropy. The Rydberg-atom interactions are controlled via adiabatic passage in Landau-Zener crossings in the Rydberg-atom Stark map, which allows the preparation of dense, highly dipolar quantum matter."
0.015,"The goal of this project is to investigate the science and technology of pulsed plasma processing of semiconductor wafers aimed towards developing a knowledge base that will enable pulsed plasmas to be optimized for materials modification. Plasma assisted materials processing is largely responsible for the impressive progress that continues to be made in production of microelectronics devices of ever increasing capability. Plasma etching is the only known, industrially implementable method to fabricate the nanometer sized features in logic and memory chips. During plasma etching, fluxes of ions and neutral particles are directed towards the wafer being processed. The energy and angle of impact of the particles onto the surface of wafers are the critical parameters for the fabrication of microelectronic devices, as well as nanostructured and biocompatible materials. Control of these parameters allows for finer control of the surface composition and, in microelectronics fabrication, etch rate. Low temperature plasmas for plasma materials processing have traditionally used continuously excited plasmas. However, all major semiconductor chip and equipment manufacturers are predicting that pulsed plasmas will be the enabling technology for achieving sub-10 nanometer feature sizes. The most direct impact of this research is addressing fundamental science issues that are of paramount importance to the plasma processing of high performance microelectronics, nanostructures and biocompatible materials. In addition to the technological broader impacts, this project will be highly focused on educational outreach. Prof. Gekelman is one of the founders of LAPTAG (Los Angeles Physics Teachers Alliance Group) and several LAPTAG students and will be involved in these plasma processing studies. Prof. Kushner, director of the Michigan Institute of Plasma Science and Engineering, will leverage those resources to launch the Plasma Picture of the Day website with the goal of providing informative images of plasmas to educate the general public and school children about plasmas.<br/><br/>The lack of fundamental understanding of the dynamics of pulsed plasma systems is the current impediment to widespread adoption. For example, instabilities and waves are nearly universally observed in pulsed plasmas, and particularly in electronegative plasmas, which sometimes prevents operation in desirable parameters spaces. The sources of these instabilities and the means to prevent them are not understood. Pulsed plasma processing can be arbitrarily complex. For example, modern capacitively coupled plasma etching tools may be driven by up to 3 separate power supplies at different frequencies which can be pulsed independently at different repetition rates and different duty cycles. The combinations of parameters can number into the millions. This extremely large parameter space places a large premium on having a fundamental understanding of pulsed plasma processing and so be able to predict plasma performance. In this research project, a highly collaborative experimental-modeling effort will investigate the fundamental properties of pulsed plasmas as used in materials processing, with an emphasis on instabilities and waves, diagnosing and modeling the dynamics of the transition from interpulse afterglow to powered plasma, and the means to improve uniformity through pulsing. Laser induced fluorescence will be used to characterize the trajectory of ions as they are accelerated through the transient sheaths produced by pulsed plasmas; and will be correlated with Langmuir probe measurements of plasma properties. Multi-dimensional computer modeling will be validated by these measurements and will be further used to illuminate fundamental issues related to plasma transport in pulsed systems."

0.51,"In the project entitled ""Rydberg-atom physics in ponderomotive traps and atomic imaging devices"" optical-lattice dipole traps for Rydberg atoms are developed, improved and applied in research. These optical traps have trap-induced level shifts that are much smaller than those in static-field traps. They are therefore well suited for high-precision spectroscopy and quantum information processing applications that are currently of high interest. The lattices exhibit a rich variety of adiabatic trapping potentials, which are studied via laser spectroscopy. The effect of lattice-induced photo-ionization on the trapped Rydberg atoms is measured. A spectroscopic method is developed that is based on microwave modulation of the optical-lattice beams. The method allows the research team to drive high-order multipole transitions without the application of large fields, which would cause level shifts, and with high spatial resolution. The research team develops three-dimensional optical lattices for microwave spectroscopy of optically trapped circular-state Rydberg atoms. The work has the prospect of yielding a high-precision measurement of the Rydberg constant.<br/><br/>In the second component of the work, a tip imaging probe (TIP) is employed to perform spatial-domain measurements of correlations in many-body Rydberg systems. In these systems, several de-localized Rydberg excitations are coherently shared between a large number of cold atoms in a highly entangled quantum state. The TIP system reads out the positions of individual Rydberg excitations in the sample via ion imaging. New measurements with the TIP setup allow the researchers to separate blockade-induced effects and effects due to Coulomb ion repulsion in the measured signals. The TIP experiment is applied to prepare and detect Rydberg atom crystals excited by adiabatic passage in randomly distributed samples of ground-state atoms.<br/><br/>Trapping individual atoms continues to be a major theme in atomic, molecular and optical physics. In a so-called ""optical lattice,"" several intersecting laser beams are used to form a periodic grid of trap sites to trap atoms. An optical lattice is much like an egg carton holding eggs at periodic locations (where an egg is the atom's analogue). In this project a Michigan research team develops such optical lattices for Rydberg atoms. A Rydberg atom is a giant atom with one very loosely bound electron that travels, on average, quite far away from the atom's center. The research community believes that, in the long term, Rydberg atoms in laser traps can be helpful in the development of powerful quantum computers, which can treat mathematical problems that ordinary computers cannot solve. The optical Rydberg atom traps the Michigan team develops also have the potential of yielding information on fundamental constants, such as the Rydberg constant. Measurements of such constants are of great value because they serve as tests of our current understanding of the composition of matter and the inner workings of nature. In the project, graduate and undergraduate students are trained in research, research presentation, and in peer instruction. The project as a whole has a broader impact on society in that students at all levels become prepared to assume important tasks in science, industry and education. The project is accompanied by outreach components that aim to encourage high-school students to consider careers in science or engineering, such as the Michigan Physics Olympiad."
0.16,"Precise experimental tests of fundamental particle properties are now a well-established way to search for new laws of nature beyond our current physical knowledge. The research presented in this proposal challenges precise Standard Model predictions and could provide solid signals of new physics by measuring the magnetic-moment anomaly of the muon, a known elementary particle that is produced in abundance at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The proposed research is also to study the detailed behavior of the radioactive decay of neutrons. This work addresses questions at the deepest level: what is matter made of, how did it come to be and how does it interact? At the same time, this research addresses the technical demands of the experiments by pushing the limits of magnetic field measurement to a higher level.<br/><br/>The existing 3.6-sigma difference between the Standard-Model prediction and the experimental value of g-2 of the muon provides a persistent laboratory signal of new physics, and we have the opportunity to advance the precision and strengthen the signal to reach discovery level. As part of the Fermilab Muon g-2 collaboration, our goal is to improve the experimental precision by a factor of four, which would result in a 7-sigma signal if the central value does not change, or even larger if the theory error is reduced. The University of Michigan group has shifted its effort from fundamental neutron physics with expertise in neutron polarization and precision neutron polarimetry to the problem of measurement of the muon-storage ring magnetic field. This expertise and experience in precision spin-precession and NMR-based magnetometry with polarized 3He will be applied to the problem of absolute calibration of the magnetic field measurement system and determining the systematic errors on the field measurement. In particular, this research will fund: 1) development of NMR techniques and systematics of the NMR-based magnetic-field measurement system and 2) work towards an absolute measurement of the 3He magnetic moment in a Penning trap. Furthermore, the proposed research will complete the development of the SNS beam for the Nab experiment, specifically the determination of the residual polarization of the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline (FNPB) beam using a 3He spin filter."
0.145,"Porous media may be thought of as material that is essentially transparent to fluid flow (e.g. gas or liquid). The internal surface area of such materials is substantial, making the material excellent for chemical processing applications. Porous media play an important role in modern society with applications ranging from water filtration, such as activated charcoal filters, to air filtration. Indeed, a catalytic converter exploits porous media's high surface area to volume ratio to achieve high emission reduction efficiency in automobile exhausts. New and emerging applications of porous media include fuel cells and clean combustion. Porous media combustion in particular takes place in the pores. The energy released there elevates the medium temperature so that injected fuel automatically ignites upon entry. This technology has the potential to reduce auto emissions and significantly increase fuel efficiency by enabling very lean fuel burns. The introduction of small amounts of ionized gas, a micro-plasma, inside the pores can further reduce ignition temperature thereby allowing for further increases in efficiency. Additionally, reactive micro-plasmas produced in the pores have the potential to decompose toxic combustion byproducts as well as to clean the pores to greatly improve service lifetime. Currently, the micro-plasma production in porous media is not well understood. This effort aims to improve the understanding and optimize the production of micro-plasmas in porous media by using a combination of experiments and simulations. The goal of the effort is to bridge the gap between scientific understanding of plasma production in porous media and actual applications. The understanding obtained from this effort contributes to the development and realization of clean burning, highly efficient, low emission automobiles, advanced fuel cells and advanced industrial smoke stack scrubbers. <br/><br/>A fundamental understanding of the physical conditions that lead to interconnected plasma propagation from pore to pore is necessary before one can credibly control and thus exploit micro-plasmas in porous media (MPPM). We expect that a combination of diffusive transport between pores and plasma avalanche within the pores, augmented by surface charging and radiation transport, play key roles in establishing plasma interconnectivity between adjacent pores. However there is now little experimental or theoretical confirmation of these or other theories. In this research project, we will investigate the basic properties of atmospheric pressure plasmas propagating into and through porous media in chemically reacting environments. The goals are to improve our understanding of plasma-surface interactions, which lead to MPPM, through a collaborative investigation combining comprehensive experimental measurements and first-principles, fluid, hybrid and kinetic modeling. Two configurations will be studied. The first is a structured porous material represented by a pack-bed reactor consisting of dielectric beads or rods having a controlled radius, permittivity, conductivity and layout placed between metal electrodes. The second configuration will be a truly randomly structured porous material, ceramic and/or metal foam, as is commercially available. The project also includes a K-12 outreach effort targeting low-income students. The effort aims to introduce the students to plasma science and the emerging field of plasma-aided combustion through both hands on experiments and science lesson modules."
0.094807,"The proton is one of the building blocks of everyday matter, with protons in the core of every atom. The proton is in turn made of subnuclear particles known as quarks and gluons. The project supported by this award will improve our understanding of the proton's internal structure, with a focus on the dynamical behavior of the constituent quarks. High-energy particle accelerator facilities at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) will be used to perform the research. A beam of protons will be accelerated to high energy and strike a liquid hydrogen target; the nucleus of a hydrogen atom is comprised of a single proton. Measurement of the particles produced in the collisions will provide information on the behavior of the quarks in their parent protons.<br/><br/>The efforts supported by this award will additionally serve to increase diversity among young scientists trained as nuclear physicists. Training the next generation of nuclear physicists is critical to maintain expertise relevant to the nation's energy and defense needs and to continue advancing both applied and non-applied research in nuclear physics and technology. In each year of this award a student from Mount Holyoke College, an undergraduate institution for women, will be given the opportunity to perform summer research in nuclear physics at Fermilab. Furthermore, this award will provide tuition, salary, and travel support for an African-American graduate student. In addition to supporting his dissertation research, he will receive support to travel once per semester to his alma mater, Howard University, a historically black university, to speak with current physics undergraduates about his experience and progress pursuing a Ph.D. in nuclear physics."
0.45,"The research objective of this project is to measure and model the properties of radiation, and the complex electron dynamics, resulting from the electromagnetic interaction of electron beams generated in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions. Conventional accelerator facilities must be large because the accelerating fields are limited by electrical breakdown of the material when the potential difference reaches some threshold. Energy gain is force times distance, so if the field strength (and therefore force) is limited then the distance must be increased to achieve higher and higher particle energies. This has lead to many mile scale facilities being constructed. However, if we use completely ionized gas -- plasma -- it turns out that an accelerating structure can be generated that is not limited in field strength. In other words; an accelerator can be miniaturized. The astonishing field strength in a plasma based accelerator can typically be equivalent to a 2 mile conventional accelerator being reduced to half a meter in length. Plasma accelerators can be created using high intensity lasers, which generate an evacuated ionic cavity, or 'bubble' with strong accelerating electric fields. It turns out that this plasma 'bubble' also has ideal characteristics for providing a miniature wiggler structure; an alternative to an external magnetic structure (such as the 1 mile length LCLS extension to SLAC) for generating radiation. The plasma can therefore be both an accelerator and wiggler combined. Alternatively, a second laser beam can also be used to wiggle the electrons. In both caes, a Doppler-like effect means that the radiation emitted by the relativistic electron beam is upshifted to much higher frequencies than those of the oscillating structure. The combination of lasers and plasmas can therefore provide very intense, energetic sources of x and gamma rays.<br/><br/>The drive for radiation sources is prompted by the numerous applications, from aiding the development of the anti-flu drug Relenza or a vaccine for foot and mouth disease to imaging residual stresses in aircraft wings or determining whether Beethoven was poisoned by analysis of a sample of his hair. This has motivated the development of large x-ray light sources around the world. The research proposed here is of a fundamental nature but also with an exciting applicability and potential technological impact. There are a vast number of unanswered questions on the laser propagation, plasma behavior, and radiation generation to be explored. However, one of the most exciting things associated with the research is the potential for miniature and inexpensive synchrotron light sources that could be available more widely; accessible to universities, small research facilities or hospitals. This could revolutionize a vast swath of scientific and engineering disciplines, as researchers from biotechnology to mechanical engineering are currently waiting for time on existing synchrotron light sources. Increased access to brilliant x-ray light sources could therefore increase the progress of technologic development in many fields."
0.4,"This CAREER project focuses on fundamental physics research at the interface of quantum field theory, general relativity and string theory. A main theme in this study is supersymmetry. Supersymmetry is one of the best motivated candidates for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, and it has many important applications. The PI plans to use supersymmetry and other techniques to address open problems in three main directions of research: (1) exploring quantum gravity with black holes and the gauge-gravity correspondence; (2) investigating scattering amplitudes in gauge theory and gravity; and (3) studying models of supersymmetry breaking and their phenomenological consequences. The work is relevant because it addresses fundamental questions in physics and because understanding supersymmetry breaking could be central for the discovery of new elementary particles in collider experiments.<br/><br/>The broader impact component of the project involves the training of students, a women-in-physics program, and public lectures. An exchange program between the University of Michigan and the women's college Bryn Mawr will be initiated to encourage the involvement of women in physics research. It will involve research seminars at both institutions and possible new collaborations. The public lectures will be pedagogical lectures on the PI's research and they will be presented as part of the Saturday Morning Physics series hosted by the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan."
0.42,"With this award the PI will employ two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to investigate the underlying physical mechanisms governing the directional ultrafast transfer of energy between the antennae and reaction centers of photosynthetic purple bacteria. The program of research will both push the capabilities of 2DES as a powerful and quantitative method for studying natural photosynthetic systems, and use 2DES to address open questions about photosynthesis in purple bacteria. Specifically, this research aims to answer the following questions: 1) What are the roles of vibrational and electronic coherence in energy transfer and charge separation in purple bacteria? 2) How do purple bacteria remodel their energy-landscape to regulate energy transfer under high and low light conditions? This research aims to extend the capabilities of 2DES spectroscopy to perform the first 2DES experiments on single crystals of photosynthetic complexes as well as the first 2DES experiments on whole cells. Improvements in the capabilities of 2DES, and its ability to provide feedback to theoretical modeling of energy transfer and charge separation in purple bacteria as a model system will ultimately pave the way for a better understanding of the more complex plant photosystems. Understanding the role of coherence in photosynthetic energy transfer and charge separation may drive the development of new theoretical models of these processes. The award also aims to promote a positive image of science through public education, and in particular to encourage women and minorities to enter careers in science through outreach activities and mentored undergraduate research.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

In the area of collider phenomenology, the PI plans to pursue signature-based studies of physics beyond the Standard Model, especially as it concerns the nature of dark matter. The PI also plans to also continue her work to ensure that unexpected physics --- such as that emerging from a possible low-mass hidden sector (or so-called ``Hidden Valley'') --- is not missed in analyses of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the astrophysics and cosmology side of her work, the PI plans to focus on the indirect detection of dark matter, and on the construction and analysis of various models of neutrino physics.<br/><br/>This activity also includes a major program of education and outreach, with three specific public-outreach activities planned. The first is to develop, in collaboration with the Exhibit Museum for Natural History at the University of Michigan, a segment visualizing dark matter and its detection, on scales from the earth to clusters of galaxies. Such a segment will have a reach of 18,000 annual visitors to the museum planetarium, and many more through distribution to other planetaria nationwide. Second, the PI will present public lectures in a very popular Saturday-morning lecture series at the University of Michigan, discussing the existence of dark matter and the fundamental physics of cosmic anti-matter. Approximately 500 people attend these lectures in person, with much wider availability made through the University television station and iTunes U downloads on the web. Finally, the PI will act as a role model, and plan activities and demonstrations in a ""Science for Tomorrow"" program which is specifically designed to reach girls and minority youth interested in careers in science."

The nature of these edges has vexed physicists, beginning with Einstein, for nearly a century. They are governed by an elegant and beautiful set of quantum laws discovered four decades ago by Bekenstein and Hawking. These laws indicate that black holes are at once the simplest and most complex objects in the physical universe. They are simple because, according to Einstein's general relativity there is in effect nothing inside - space ends at the horizon. They are complex because the Bekenstein-Hawking laws imply that they must carry the maximal allowable information. The coexistence of these dichotomous descriptions of black holes underlies a deep paradox whose resolution is a focal point of modern physics. While the basic paradox remains unsolved, much has been learned using a variety of apporaches. Resolving the paradox is a central problem in modern physics and will likely lead to profound new insights into the nature of our universe, comparable to those following from quantum mechanics and relativity.<br/><br/>In this project we propose specific steps to continue these fruitful investigations as well as more generally address universal aspects of the paradox, in its many manifestations surrounding black hole and other horizons. Our investigations will be informed by important lessons learned in the process of studying string theory (a candidate for a fundamental unified theory of nature), but we will concentrate on universal aspects of large-scale observable phenomena which are independent of any assumptions about the as yet-unknown completion of the fundamental laws of nature. Here we pursue a bottom-up approach working from astrophysically observed properties of horizons, the powerful symmetry -general covariance- underlying Einstein's theory of general relativity, and basic physical and mathematical consistency."
0.16,"Atoms are the basic building blocks of nature and their behavior is governed by a microscopic theory of matter called quantum mechanics. Our understanding of nearly everything we see in nature relies on quantum mechanics as applied to atoms and their close cousins, molecules (two or more atoms stuck together by a chemical bond). From humans and other living things to computers and the internet, physical systems can be explained only by knowing how atoms and molecules behave in detail. Yet, although quantum mechanics has been very successful in describing very simple atomic systems, we do not yet know how to apply the theory quantitatively to describe all the phenomena that we see. In particular, to invent new technological and biological substances, we need to understand the quantum mechanics of atoms and molecules better. The eventual goal of much of physics (including atomic physics) is to have a complete understanding of all matter and the tools to invent new types of matter. This project is a step toward developing a detailed quantum understanding of the interactions between atoms and molecules in a gas at a very low temperature. When cooled, the quantum nature of atoms and molecules is greatly amplified, exposing its nature to careful study. <br/><br/>The essential experimental approach to this work is to use magnetic trapping of atoms and molecules to study their collisions using laser spectroscopy. The technical method will be to use buffer-gas cooling to form a beam of atoms and molecules, which will be optically pumped into magnetically trapped states as they pass through the trapping region. Half the molecules in the beam are originally in the low-field-seeking quantum state. These molecules lose energy as they approach the magnetic field maximum of the trap, where they will be optically pumped into their high-field-seeking state. These molecules then continue to lose energy as they travel toward the trap center. Near the trap center lasers pump the molecules into their trapped state. Only two photons are scattered in this process and this (along with energy loss as the molecules pass through the trap) leads to irreversible trap loading. We will trap molecules of calcium monofluoride and other small molecules into a magnetic trap using this method. Atoms can also be co-loaded with molecules, at high enough density for evaporative cooling. We will co-load lithium and/or potassium atoms and study collisions between them and the trapped molecules, testing molecular theory and investigating a route toward ultracold molecules using sympathetic cooling. Spectroscopy will reveal both the state distribution of the molecules, as well as their number and temperature. Investigation of trap loss can be used to study spin-relaxation collisions (for which there is detailed theory for some atom-molecule pairs). The longer term goal of this work is to enable observation of exchange of energy and other phenomena in increasingly complex atom-molecule collisions, starting with diatomic and triatomic molecules. This will add to our fundamental understanding of nature and help science to design new physical systems and new tools for chemistry and biology."
0.145,"Reactive ion etching (or plasma etching) is a critical operation in the manufacturing of integrated circuits (or 'chips') to produce extremely precise features, at the nanometer (a billionth of a meter) scale. Without this process we would have no portable cell phones, laptop computers and all the other modern marvels we take for granted. Ever smaller feature dimensions will allow more transistors to be packed onto chips, resulting in increased information storage and faster computers. This evolution in chip speed and function has progressed steadily over the past 50 years, following Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles about every 18 months. Recently, while studying reactive ion etching of silicon, a rather startling discovery was made: silicon was etched, even when no reactive ions were present. Careful experiments revealed that this etching was due to photons, originating in the plasma. This in-plasma photo-assisted etching produced etched feature shapes that are not optimum for integrated circuits and thus may prove to be a show-stopper in the burgeoning field of etching with atomic precision. This project will combine experiments and simulations to understand the mechanism of in-plasma photo-assisted etching, and identify conditions to suppress this phenomenon. The study will produce a fundamental understanding of the photo-physics and chemistry at the plasma-semiconductor interface and will have a significant impact in the microelectronics industry as well as the field of nanotechnology, with clear societal benefits.<br/><br/>This systematic investigation of plasma-surface interactions will focus on in-situ photon-plasma synergism, and its effect on etching of semiconductor materials in halogen-containing plasmas. A combination of experiments and simulations will address questions such as: (a) What are the synergistic effects of photons and i) positive ions, ii) electrons, iii) negative ions, iv) halogen atoms? (b) does the sheath potential affect photo-assisted etching rates and if so, how and what is the cause? (c) what is the effect of surface plasmons (plasmonics) in the case of samples patterned with sub-wavelength features? A novel dual plasma reactor will be employed, to provide controlled fluxes of ions, UV-VUV photons, and radicals bombarding the substrate. The UV-VUV light intensity, ion flux and ion energy striking the substrate will be measured through a pinhole on the substrate holder, in a differentially pumped analysis chamber. Self-consistent simulations of the electric field distribution and species (electrons, holes, positive ions) fluxes in the plasma as well as in the solid, and electromagnetic calculations of surface plasmon propagation and absorption will be performed. Simulations coupled with experiments will provide insights in the mechanism of photo-assisted etching for varying substrate bias (potential of the sheath over the semiconductor), photon flux and energy, dopant concentration, as well as nanofeature size and aspect ratio. Finally, attempts will be made to exploit photo-assisted etching of silicon to create nanoholes with dimensions (e.g., 3 nm dia.) much smaller than those produced by conventional reactive ion etching."
0.48,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Michael Desai at Harvard University. <br/><br/>In the large and mostly asexual populations characteristic of many microbes and viruses, multiple mutations are often present simultaneously. Natural selection cannot act on each separately, but rather only on combinations of mutations linked together on physical chromosomes, an effect known as interference selection. Evolution in these populations involves a complex balance between the accumulation of beneficial mutations (adaptation) and the stochastic accumulation of weakly deleterious mutations (Muller's ratchet). In this project, the PI will develop mathematical models to predict how this interference selection among the full spectrum of beneficial and deleterious mutations alters evolutionary dynamics and genetic diversity in microbial populations, and test these predictions using experimental evolution of budding yeast as a model system. The project will focus on (1) the distribution of fitness within a population, (2) the distribution of fitness effects of fixed mutations, and (3) the within-population patterns of genetic diversity.<br/><br/>This research will also have significant broader impacts. It will involve graduate students and postdocs, providing interdisciplinary training involving the integration of methods from statistical physics, evolutionary biology, population genetics, and applied mathematics. The PI will also develop new course curricula to help physical scientists transition into research in evolution and population genetics. This will include an undergraduate course providing a mathematically sophisticated but biologically naïve introduction to the quantitative basis of evolutionary theory. In addition, the PI will co-organize a summer school in Cargese, France, to serve the broader community of physical scientists at the graduate and postdoctoral levels seeking to transition into evolution and population genetics. The summer school will use the research in this proposal as one of several case studies illustrating how population genetic theory, bioinformatics, and quantitative experiments can all contribute to our understanding of evolution."
2.718,"The antihydrogen atom, a bound state of a positron and an antiproton, is the simplest atom made entirely of antimatter. This unusual atom has been produced and suspended within magnetic fields that keep the antimatter atoms suspended at a central location. The intellectual merit of precise comparisons of the properties of the antihydrogen atoms and their matter counterpart arises from the possibility of testing the prediction of the most fundamental physics theory, namely that matter and antimatter particles are ""exactly opposite"", with charges of opposite sign and masses that are identical, and that antimatter atoms and matter atoms have precisely the same properties. <br/><br/> There are good reasons to believe that the most fundamental physics theory is not a complete description. Discovering a difference between the structure of antimatter and matter atoms would thus lead to an improved theory of fundamental physics, the consequences of which are potentially important for science and future technology. Moreover, this research is the training ground for some of the most gifted science students and postdocs, preparing them for the successful careers in science and technology that are needed for a technological society to thrive. Methods developed for such fundamental research typically find their way into more common applications. Finally, many lectures on this science are used to educate students, professional scientists, and the general public."
0.48,"This award funds a research project under the direction of Professor Daniel Needleman at Harvard University.<br/><br/>When a cell divides, each of its daughter cells must receive a complete copy of its DNA. First the DNA is duplicated, and then the two copies of DNA are segregated into the daughter cells by a highly complex, self-organizing structure called the spindle. While many of the components of the spindle have been studied in detail, there is still very little known about how the spindle assembles and carries out its function. Understanding self-organizing structures such as the spindle is not only crucial for biology, but also poses a fundamental challenge for physics, since these systems are living materials that behave drastically differently from the inert matter that has been traditionally studied in condensed matter physics. In this project, Professor Needleman will employ approaches from physics, including quantitative experiments and mathematical theories, to understand the spindle. The goal of this research is to develop and test theories that might explain the responses of the spindle to drugs and to biochemical and physical perturbations.<br/><br/>This project is envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Understanding the response of the spindle to perturbations may have medical benefits, as errors in spindle function are believed to cause some cancers and birth defects, and many chemotherapy agents work by interfering with the spindle. Studying the spindle from a quantitative perspective may also provide fundamental insights into nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, improve our understanding of living matter, and lead to the ability to design new materials. Undergraduate and graduate students working on this project will receive highly interdisciplinary training. The results obtained through this research project will also be disseminated in research journals and on the lab web site. Course material for students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels will be developed and used to promote interdisciplinary training for a wider audience. Professor Needleman will also take an active role in outreach to high school teachers and in encouraging high school students to pursue STEM careers."
1.5,"The intellectual merit of this work derives from the possibility to make some of the most precise and fundamental measurements in physics. One goal is to make the most precise measurement of the property of an elementary particle -- the electron magnetic moment measured in Bohr magnetons. A second goal is to test the most successful and fundamental theory of physics, quantum electrodynamics (QED), to an unprecedented level of precision, arguably the most precise comparison of any theory and experiment. Quantum electrodynamics describes the interaction of matter and light, and it sets the standard to modern particle theories aspire. A third goal is to make the most precise comparison of a lepton and an antilepton (by a factor of 15 or more), the electron and the positron, as a test of CPT invariance. A fourth goal is to make the most precise determination of the fundamental fine structure constant. This constant gives the strength of the electromagnetic interaction in the low energy limit and it characterizes the size of a wide variety of phenomena, ranging from the energy scales in atoms, to the ac Josephson effect, to the quantum Hall effect. In addition, the fine structure constant is one of the crucial measured constants (along with the Rydberg and Planck's constant) for accurately determining the system of basic units that are important to a technological society rooted in science. A fifth goal is to observe the spin flip of a proton on the way to comparing the magnetic moments of the antiproton and proton a million times more accurately than has previously been possible. A sixth goal is to investigate the possibility of adapting the precision measurement methods to make the first scalable, one-electron qubit for quantum information studies.<br/><br/>The devices and methods that will make these unusually precise measurements possible are interesting in their own right. They will include a cylindrical Penning trap cavity cooled to 100 mK, quantum nondemolition observations of one-quantum transitions of a single electron, self-excitation of a one-particle oscillator, feedback cooling, inhibition of spontaneous emission, quantum jump spectroscopy of one electron's spin and cyclotron levels and cavity sideband cooling. The experiments also offer outstanding educational opportunities. Junior participants who learned their craft doing work in this area are now engaged in research careers in various subfields of physics."
0.439999,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Howard Georgi and Cumrun Vafa at the Physics Department of Harvard University, along with post-docs and students. The area of research covered by this project includes two broad classes: One in particle physics and the other in string theory. The particle physics side will involve the development of a new idea in describing the high energy scattering of particles using the idea that the aftermath of collisions involves a shell of energy which emanates from the collision site of the particles. This is an area which is currently being developed by Georgi and his students. In string theory, the fundamental objects are strings, not particles. All string theories exist in a higher number of dimensions, and the method of reducing these to four dimensions can lead to theories that can be compared with experiments. Vafa will be continuing his work on better understanding of these theories, including the various methods of reducing the numbers of dimensions. <br/><br/>Georgi's work in particle physics will involve the development of LSET (Light-Shell effective theory). The hope is that this approach will give a different effective theory involving high energy scatterings, of the type encountered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), complementary to the Soft Collinear Effective Theory approach currently used, and may lead to new methods of analyzing the large number of particles produced in these collisions. On the string theory front Vafa will be continuing his work on better understanding of superconformal theories which have been discovered to exist in 5 and 6 dimensions. These theories involve tensionless strings. Computation of their partition functions have been developed recently and their relation to (twistorial) topological string is the major focus of this effort."
0.510025,"This research is concerned with the study of geometric structures occurring in field and string theories using methods from mathematics as well as from physics. The intertwine of research in both fields has led to many surprising connections and new ideas. A rich source of insights is the study of the deformation of the geometrical structures associated to physical quantities. This has led to an understanding of physical dualities and has uncovered a rich variety of new mathematical structures. The change of certain characteristics of the underlying mathematical description known as wall crossing is a very powerful feature of many mathematical deformation problems. These questions are best studied using mirror symmetry which combines techniques from various fields of mathematics. The projects proposed here intend to derive new mathematical ideas, structures and tools associated to physical deformation problems shedding thus new light both on the physical theories as well as on the interconnections between different mathematical structures. A class of objects which is suitable for studying wall crossing phenomena are supersymmetric BPS (Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield) objects. These have played a prominent role in understanding field theories, dualities and black hole micro-state counting problems. They will be studied in the context of string theory compactifications where they are associated to a special set of objects, the D-branes, which are studied using tools from topological string theory and mirror symmetry. These allow one to systematically study the dependence of these on the moduli of the theory, leading to powerful equations and important insights. Understanding BPS spectra and their jumping is furthermore crucial to unravel their deep role in the description of physical theories. By connecting ideas from theoretical physics and very diverse areas of mathematics such as differential and algebraic geometry, representation theory and number theory, these projects are pushing the boundaries of knowledge in these fields. The PI is a pioneer and leader in the field of geometry and mathematical aspects of string theory. <br/>Broader Impacts: Lying at the intersection of cutting edge research in both physics and mathematics, the project seeks to enhance the interactions and communication between the two communities. An integral part is to train postdocs and graduate students to be comfortable using methods and ideas from various fields and to conduct advanced cross disciplinary research. The PI is also actively bringing fundamental science and research to the public through various talks, presentations and publications."
0.44,"Particle accelerators are ubiquitous in society as they are used in particle physics, materials science, structural biology, medicine, and transmutation of nuclear waste. In some cases these accelerators are more than a mile long and cost billions of dollars. If a new cheaper and more compact accelerator technology could be developed, it would transform our ability to use particle accelerators and enable their application to an even wider range of problems of scientific and societal benefit. This research will examine fundamental scientific questions aimed at developing compact particle accelerators based on plasma waves (these are waves moving in fully ionized gases) moving near the speed of light. It will also require generating state-of-the-art software that can be used on the nation's largest computers. The students and post-doctoral researchers trained under this grant will be part of the twenty first century work force in computational science and engineering as well as experts in plasma physics and accelerator physics.<br/><br/>This is an award to perform full-scale three-dimensional numerical experiments of high-intensity particle and laser beam-matter interactions to significantly advance the understanding of basic high-energy density science (HEDS) on ultra intense laser and particle beam plasma interactions. This understanding will aid in the quest to make plasma based accelerator stages for use in high energy physics colliders, next generation light sources, medicine, and homeland security. This work will continue to blend basic research with three-dimensional simulations, including full-scale particle-in-cell modeling of ongoing and planned experiments. High-fidelity full-scale modeling provides the means to extrapolate parameters into regimes that will not be accessible to experiments for years to come. During the past decade, a hierarchy of state-of-the-art PIC codes and data analysis tools for HEDS studies has been developed that not only include the necessary physics but also scale to more than 1,600,000 cores and can run on current many core hardware including GPUs and Intel Phi's. With this set of tools, the UCLA Simulation of Plasma Group is uniquely positioned to continue to make significant progress towards determining the feasibility of building a compact X-Ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) in the next decade, and a future linear collider based on wakefield sections driven by lasers or particle beams."
0.15,"This project is aimed at finding and exploring new states of matter, particularly ""quantum matter"" in which the counterintuitive and surprising effects of the theory of quantum mechanics plays a crucial role. In condensed matter materials such as conductors, superconductors, and magnets, atoms are arranged in regular crystals, and the electric and magnetic properties of the material emerge from the motion of electrons within that crystal. The physics of this motion is very complex, and many associated fundamental questions are unanswered. In order to better understand this physics, the scientists working on this project are building an enlarged model system of such matter: they are using atoms instead of electrons, and these atoms move in crystals formed by light. The atoms have to be at extremely cold temperatures, only a billionth of a degree above absolute zero. This way they behave quantum mechanically like the electrons in condensed matter systems. One strange feature of the ultracold system is that each atom is at many places at the same time. This synthetic condensed matter system can be very well characterized and directly compared to theory using a ""Quantum Gas Microscope"" (invented during the previous cycle of NSF funding to this research group) to image every single atom with perfect fidelity. The particular focus of this work is to create ""Bosonic fractional quantum hall states""--states of matter whose behavior is dictated by ""Entanglement,"" the most non-classical manifestation of quantum mechanics, famously described by Albert Einstein as ""Spooky action in a distance."" By addressing open questions linked to these materials, the researchers supported by this grant are working to advance science towards the ultimate goal of tailoring new quantum materials from scratch with yet unknown properties. Such materials could find applications in quantum information devices, and in quantum metrology. This project trains students and postdocs in a broad range of physics and in many modern technologies such as laser optics. <br/><br/>Fractional quantum Hall states represent new states of matter that contain topological order. While Fermionic fractional quantum Hall states of electrons have been previously observed in 2D electron materials, the work supported by this grant work aims to experimentally realize and explore fractional quantum Hall states with small ensembles of strongly interacting bosonic atoms that quickly rotate in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. Such ensembles experience a gauge field, and are expected to adiabatically transition into the bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. While the particle number in such ensembles is small, on the order of 4-10 particles, the quantum gas microscope will enable the researchers to detect every single particle with near unity fidelity. Therefore, they can carry out a complete quantum limited measurement of the mesoscopic many- body system. In particular they seek to directly measure particle correlation functions in momentum space, which would give very direct evidence of the highly entangled many-body states."
0.596066,"This project was developed at an NSF Ideas Lab on ""Cracking the Olfactory Code"" and is jointly funded by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Physics Division, the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division, and the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems. The project is a synergistic combination of laboratory experiments and computer modeling that will lead to better understanding of how animals use the sense of smell to navigate in the real world. Almost universally, from flies to mice to dogs, animals use odors to find critical resources, such as food, shelter, and mates. To date, no engineered device can replicate this function and understanding the code used by the brain will lead to many novel applications. Cracking codes, from neural codes to the Enigma code of WWII, is aided by a deep understanding of the content of messages that are being transmitted and how they will be used by their intended receivers. To crack the olfactory code, the team will focus on how odors move in landscapes, how animals extract spatial and temporal cues from odor landscapes, and how they use movement for enhancing these cues while progressing towards their targets. The proposed work encompasses physical measurement of odor plumes, behavioral measurement of animals' paths through olfactory environments, electrophysiological and optical measurement of neural activity during olfactory navigation, perturbations of the environment via virtual reality and of neuronal hardware via genetics, and multilevel mathematical modeling. The PIs will teach and work with undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students and especially recruit students from underrepresented groups in science. The project's results may lead to improved methods for the detection of explosives, new olfactory robots to replace trained animals, and new theoretically-grounded advances in robotic control. The project will inform the development of technologies that interfere with the ability of flying insects (including disease vectors and crop pests) to locate their odor target, thus opening a new door for developing 'green' technologies to solve problems that are of global economic and humanitarian importance.<br/><br/>This proposal is a synergistic combination of laboratory experiments and computational modeling that will probe how animals use olfaction to navigate in their environment. Specifically, this effort seeks to solve the difficult problem of olfactory navigation through the following aims: (i) Generate and quantify standardized, naturalistic odor environments that can be used to perform empirical and theoretical tests of navigation strategies; (ii) Determine phenomenological algorithms for odor-guided navigation through behavioral experiments in diverse animal species; (iii) Determine how odor cues for navigation are encoded and used in the nervous system by recording neuronal data and simulating putative neural circuits that implement these processes; (iv) Manipulate olfactory environments and neural circuitry, to evaluate model robustness. In contrast to previous attempts to understand olfactory navigation, the present strategy emphasizes mechanisms that are biologically feasible and explores the wide range of temporal and spatial scales in which animals successfully navigate. The project will generate datasets of immediate use and importance to scientists in theoretical biology and mathematics, engineering (fluid mechanics, electronic olfaction, and robotics) and biology (neuroscience, ecology and evolution)."
0.13068,"The project will investigate the ability of insects to detect and respond to infrared light, which is a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than that of visible light. It is known from insects as diverse as honeybees, beetles and butterflies that animals have evolved diverse strategies to perceive and utilize electromagnetic waves. Organs evolved for perceiving or controlling electromagnetic waves often surpass similar man-made devices in both sophistication and efficiency. To date, most of the focus in this area of research has been on the abilities of insects to perceive shorter wavelengths of light; much less is known about how animals respond to longer wavelengths, in part because the tools to investigate this end of the spectrum have only recently become commonly available. In this research, physicists and biologists will collaborate in studying a few model systems, including the antennae of moths and specialized wing scales of butterflies, to understand how insects can perceive and utilize infrared light. Understanding and harnessing natural design concepts through ""biomimicry"" will deepen our knowledge of complex biological systems and inspire ideas for creating new technologies. The research will provide training opportunities in nanotechnology for graduate students in biology and physics. <br/><br/>The objectives of the project are to understand the physical mechanisms underlying the ability of insects to perceive and respond to infrared light, and to obtain engineering insights that can be used to create novel infrared materials, devices and systems. Infrared signals may play a critical and underappreciated role in a wide variety of insect behaviors. This project will provide a quantitative understanding of insects' abilities to sense and respond to broadband thermal radiation and narrowband fingerprint infrared radiation by analyzing two systems: (1) Scent pads and patches on the wings of butterfly species in the hyperdiverse tribe Eumaeini (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) that show extremely broadband, close-to-unity absorptivity/emissivity, and (2) Specialized sensilla on the antennae of different moth species that are able to capture infrared light with high wavelength-specificity and efficiency. The model insects will be studied using a multidisciplinary research platform. The infrared-sensing organs will be identified using single-sensillum electrophysiological recordings and behavioral bioassays with spectrally and temporally controlled infrared stimulation. The morphology of the infrared-sensing organs will be studied using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray micro-tomography. The optical properties of the sensilla will be studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, infrared microscopy, and finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic wave simulations. High-fidelity replicas of the infrared-sensing microstructures or their scaled models will be fabricated using nano- and micro-fabrication to systematically analyze how material properties, structures and arrangement of the sensilla affect the sensitivity and wavelength-specificity of infrared detection. Detailed studies of the mechanisms by which insects perceive and respond to infrared signals have not been carried out before, and a greater understanding of this phenomenon is likely to catalyze a new area of research for the scientific community. The project will expand our understanding of how natural selection can shape exquisitely adapted behaviors and structures."
0.799998,"In this project, using novel experimental technique and theoretical tools from condensed matter physics, the PI will address the questions of how the dynamics of neuronal circuits lead to behavior and how neuronal circuits make decisions. The goal of the research is to study how information is coded in the dynamics of a circuit of five pairs of interneurons and how this circuit controls the locomotory behavior of the nematode C. elegans. The project will use confocal fluorescence microscopy in conjunction with a novel system that the PI has developed for an all-optical interrogation of neural circuits in vivo. The results from quantitative experiments will be used to distinguish between models of how information is coded in the activity of each of the ten neurons, measure the bandwidth of the information channel from each of these neurons to the motor output, model the dynamics of the interneuron circuit and determine if it can make locomotory decisions and sustain spontaneous activity. The goal of the educational part of the proposal is to improve the mathematical skills of biology majoring students, inculcate quantitative thinking and promote research at the interface of physics and biology. To do so, the PI will develop an undergraduate course to teach mathematics to biologists, promote quantitative research through undergraduate internships, graduate student and postdoctoral fellow mentoring and help incorporate basic quantitative methods into biology education at the high school level. The PI will devote resources to develop material for both high school students and teachers to inform and excite them about the opportunities in inter-disciplinary research and to help in teaching mathematics using examples from biology."
0.299917,"Our research program encompasses two different projects. The first project is an experimental search for a long-range interaction between atomic spins and the mass of the Earth. Such an interaction could arise due to a heretofore undiscovered ""fifth force"" or if gravity, as opposed to being a purely tensor interaction as assumed in general relativity, has a scalar/pseudoscalar component. Recent theoretical work has shown that such interactions could be the cause of the accelerating expansion of the universe, commonly attributed to dark energy. Our experiment seeks to detect this effect by simultaneously measuring the spin precession of two isotopes of rubidium using laser spectroscopy. Our experiment aims to improve experimental sensitivity to long-range spin-mass interactions by 1-3 orders of magnitude. Our second project focuses on development of a prototype sensor for the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics (GNOME), an array of geographically separated, time-synchronized ultrasensitive atomic comagnetometers that will search for correlated transient signals heralding new physics. The GNOME would be sensitive to nuclear and electron spin couplings to various exotic particles and fields. To date, no such search has ever been carried out, making the GNOME a novel experimental window on new physics. A specific, feasible example of new physics detectable with the GNOME, presently unconstrained by astrophysical observations and laboratory experiments, is a network of domain walls of light pseudoscalar fields.<br/><br/>Our present understanding of fundamental physics is confronted by a number of deep mysteries: the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, the nature of dark energy, and the nature of dark matter. Our experiments, conducted in laboratories on Earth, use precise measurements of atomic spins to test several hypotheses that might explain these mysteries. It has been proposed that if our present theory of gravity is incomplete, additional components of gravity could both generate the dark energy pushing the universe apart and produce an excess of matter over antimatter after the Big Bang. These additional components of gravity would also cause atomic spins to precess in the Earth's gravitational field, the effect for which our experiment will search. A possible explanation of dark matter is a network of invisible galactic-scale ""domain walls"" that store considerable mass and energy. These invisible domain walls would exert a small torque on atomic spins that could be detected when the Earth passes through a wall. We are building a prototype sensor sensitive to such torques from domain wall-crossing events. An array of time-synchronized sensors based on our prototype will search for transient signals of astrophysical origin heralding such new physics. Our research is being carried out at a public undergraduate institution with a diverse student body, providing hands-on experience in state-of-the-art experimental physics to many undergraduate students (including a significant number of women and underrepresented minorities)."
0.391581,"This project will study interactions of light with matter that are so strongly enhanced that single photons can alter the propagation of other photons. This strong enhancement will be achieved by injecting Rubidium atoms into the core of special hollow fibers, known as photonic crystal fibers, which can tightly confine the light over distances much longer than could be achieved in free space. Various interactions will be studied which could have important applications to quantum information science and could be used for highly secure communications and for quantum computing. In particular, successful realization of the three projects making up the effort could lead to a number of important quantum devices including scalable single-photon sources, deterministic quantum logic gates, and quantum repeaters.<br/><br/>Photonic band-gap fibers (PBGF) guide light via diffraction rather than by total internal reflection and allow for simultaneous high confinement of light and gases in a hollow-core region. As a result, PBGF's offer a unique advantage over free-space, focused geometries for atom-light interactions due to their unmatched ratio of path length to cross-sectional core area. The proposed effort will consist of three projects that build on the principal investigator's recent results. The first project will explore nonlinear phase shifts induced by single photons and its use for quantum non-demolition measurements. The second project entails demonstration at sub-milliwatt powers of frequency translation of a light field and its quantum properties using the process of frequency translation via the nonlinear process of Bragg scattering four-wave mixing. The third project will investigate the process of coherent photon conversion in which three quantum fields undergo a strong nonlinear interaction that is mediated by a strong pump field. These projects will address not only fundamental issues, such as whether large nonlinear phase shifts per photon are possible, but also will explore whether the Rubidium-based PBGF system can fulfill its promise as a platform for quantum information applications."
0.186,"This research focusses on two groups of topics in mathematical physics: the spectral theory of random operators, and statistical mechanics models, with special focus on two and quasi-one-dimensional systems. A wide range of methods from mathematical physics, classical analysis, probability theory, and convex geometry will be applied to study some of the open problems in these areas. In addition, the connections between the two areas will be investigated. Several major problems pertaining to random band operators remain open after many years of research. Perturbative series (such as resolvent expansions) typically diverge in the physically interesting regimes, whereas the non-perturbative methods (supersymmetric formalism, transfer operators) have been only partially developed. The PI will develop perturbative and non-perturbative methods to improve the rigorous understanding of the spectral properties of random band operators. In two- and higher dimensional statistical mechanics, the PI will investigate the large scale properties of gradient models, as well as discrete models. A better understanding of the former will also shed light on the latter (for example, on two-dimensional height models). The PI will strive to combine the well-developed multi-scale and convexity methods with techniques from analysis and high-dimensional convex geometry. <br/>Broader impacts <br/>This project will develop the connections between mathematical physics and other fields of mathematics, especially, probability theory, classical analysis and convex geometry. These connections may lead to developments in all these fields. The PI has delivered numerous talks at seminars, colloquia, and international conferences in mathematical physics, analysis, probability, high-dimensional geometry, and the interactions between these areas."
0.074999,"This award supports the calibration of Advanced LIGO data. Calibration is the essential first step in the analysis of gravitational wave data, and therefore in the LIGO critical path. Current LIGO sensitivities have already surpassed those of Initial LIGO, and the first observing run scheduled for late 2015 is almost a factor of four better than Initial LIGO. A detection of gravitational waves from a binary coalescence in the near future is therefore a distinct possibility. After a period of commissioning and observing runs, Advanced LIGO is expected to observe gravitational waves routinely. These first detections will simultaneously test our understanding of fundamental physics and provide a new means to study the universe.<br/><br/>This award supports work to develop and maintain the official Advanced LIGO time-domain calibration pipeline. This pipeline will deliver calibrated data with sub-second latencies to gravitational wave data analysts. The team will generate the digital filters required for the calibration, track changes in the instrument that affect the calibration, work on the development of a zero-latency calibration system, help produce the calibration error budget, automate calibration updates, and increase the robustness of the entire calibration procedure."
0.27,"Nature is governed by only four fundamentally different forces: electromagnetism, gravity, the strong force (which binds protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus), and the weak force (which governs certain radioactive decays and the interactions of some exotic particles). The goal of this project is to investigate certain properties of the weak force. The weak force has some features in common with the more familiar electromagnetic and gravitational forces, but also some differences. Elementary particles (such as electrons and quarks) have a particular electric charge, which determines the strength of electromagnetic force they exert, and a particular mass, which determines the strength of gravitational force they exert. By contrast, each elementary particle has two different numerical properties, analogous to electric charge, that determine the strength of the weak force they can exert. One of these numbers (known as the axial weak charge) gets modified whenever the particle is also being subjected to strong forces, such as when a proton is surrounded by other neutrons and protons inside an atomic nucleus. The precise way that the axial weak charge is modified in the presence of the strong force is a long-standing question in nuclear physics. Substantial effort has been made to understand this behavior, using large-scale experiments at accelerator facilities. In contrast, the approach funded by the present grant uses a room-sized apparatus staffed by only a few people in order to make precise measurements of the quantum mechanical energy levels in molecules. Tiny shifts in these energy levels signal the effect of the weak force, and the scientists can interpret these shifts in terms of the axial weak charge of the atomic nuclei inside the molecule. In a general sense, this project also advances the range of techniques for precision measurement science, which in the past has led to unexpected breakthroughs in technology; for example, in an earlier phase of this project the group invented a new type of magnetic resonance probe that may have broad applications.<br/><br/> The supported group uses parity violation (PV) as a tool to isolate the effect of the weak force. To isolate the nuclear axial weak charge they measure how PV depends on the nuclear spin orientation. They use diatomic molecules to achieve a dramatic increase in sensitivity compared to similar experiments with atoms. The small energy splittings and narrow spectral lines associated with hyperfine/rotational structure in molecules enhance the size of nuclear spin-dependent (NSD) PV effects by orders of magnitude relative to those in atoms. The specific goal of this work is to measure the NSD-PV effect associated with the 137Ba nucleus in the molecule BaF. This will provide a measurement of the effective axial weak charge of 137Ba. It is expected that this quantity is dominated by an effect known as the nuclear anapole moment. The anapole moment describes a distribution of magnetic fields within a nucleus that can only be induced by the weak force acting within the nucleus. It has been observed in only one nucleus so far, with a size well outside the expected range based on other kinds of experiments that have probed how the weak force is modified in the presence of strong interactions. The proposed measurement with 137Ba should shed light on this discrepancy. The method used in the proposed work also has the promise to extend to measurements on a wide range of nuclei, which would provide a rich data set for comparison to theoretical models of this phenomenon."
0.497895,"This award supports a three-year research program focusing on the study of the electro-weak structure of the nucleon using the electron beam at Jefferson Lab (JLab) as a probe. The medium-energy nuclear experimental program conducted by the PIs aims to obtain information which will help to answer the questions: ""What is the internal landscape of the nucleon?"" and ""What are the key ingredients of a New Standard Model of particle physics?"". The research program builds on the PIs previous work on the QWEAK and DVCS experiments and one of its highlights will be data taking on one of the first experiments of the JLab 12 GeV era. The goal of DVCS experiments is ultimately to provide a simultaneous spatial and momentum mapping of the internal structure of the proton. Roche is a co-spokesperson of two experiments dedicated to the study of GPDs in Hall A at JLab, one of which is scheduled to take data as early as 2014. <br/><br/>Another aspect of the program is precision measurement of interactions which can be reliably predicted by the Standard Model, for example the measurement of the rate of parity violation in electron scattering. The PIs will continue their data acquisition and analysis software work up to publication of the results of the completed QWEAK experiment and prepare for the next generation of such experiments at JLab: the MOLLER experiment.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the program are twofold: training the next generation of scientists and raising the profile of minority scientists. The research proposed by the PIs is performed in part by two graduate students. In addition, the PIs will carry out projects in which undergraduate students can meaningfully participate. Finally, this award supports the research of a woman physicist whose residence on campus and mentoring activities serve to support and encourage graduate and undergraduate women in physics."
0.48,"The primary goal of this quantum nonlinear optics research program is to study a new type of light-matter interface, realized by laser driving cold atoms, that has very large coupling strength, low absorption, and long atomic coherence times. It arises due to the simultaneous action of Sisyphus cooling of the atoms and atomic bunching in wavelength-scale structures. Fields self-generated by the light-matter interaction have a large affect on the center-of-mass motion of the atoms in a single pass through the medium, giving rise to self-assembled spatial structures in the absence of a cavity. These structures act back on the fields, giving rise to long coherence times, slow light, and quantum optical patterns arising from an absolute instability (phase transition). The investigators are using this light-matter interface to: 1) Observe a low-light-level (potentially single-photon) nonlinear phase shift when the laser-driven gas is placed in an interferometer; 2) Measure the quantum statistical properties of the radiation scattered by the driven gas of atoms near the phase transition to test recent predictions of an associated Dicke-like model; 3) Measure spontaneous pattern formation in the driven gas and correlate to the atomic spatial reorganization; 4) Observe three-dimensional (3D) Sisyphus cooling when pumping the gas with counterpropagating Bessel beams, thereby dramatically increasing the quantum coherence time of the interaction; 5) Develop a self-consistent model of the light matter interaction that accounts for propagation of the optical fields, polarization of the atoms, center-of-mass atomic motion, and Sisyphus cooling in 3D; and 6) Extend the free-space Dicke-like model to account for the new physics found in this system. This work will provide new experimental and theoretical understanding of a unique physical system that has applications to quantum nonlinear optics, especially in the development of single-photon nonlinear interactions and the study of classical and quantum phase transitions in a well-controlled environment. The program has also has implications for the study of far-from equilibrium quantum phase transitions, cold-atom physics, and condensed matter physics.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: From a broad perspective, the program has the potential to improve the performance of nonlinear optical devices by increasing the nonlinear optical sensitivity making it possible to shrink the size of the device and lower the power requirements. From an educational perspective, the program will results in the training of two graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment in both experimental and theoretical techniques in the enabling field of optical physics. It is noteworthy that the PI has been very effective in mentoring women and minority scientists and has undertaken substantial outreach in the local area elementary and middle schools to help attract more people to the science disciplines."
0.455987,"The observation of neutrinoless double beta decay will help determine the masses of neutrinos, discover lepton number violation and reveal if two-component Majorana fermions exist in Nature. EXO, a multi-tonne neutrinoless double beta decay experiment employing xenon enriched to ~80% in the isotope Xenon-136, is now taking data at the WIPP underground site in New Mexico. However, the next generation of such experiments requires advanced background reduction methods to reach Majorana neutrino mass sensitivities below 0.01 eV.<br/><br/>EXO is developing a novel technique to tag the Barium (Ba) produced in the final state of the neutrinoless double beta decay using atomic spectroscopy. This technique has the promise of drastically reducing radioactive backgrounds, providing a clean and un-ambiguous measurement with unprecedented sensitivity. Recent breakthroughs have been obtained in the Ba-tagging front. These groups have produced, for the first time, Ba transport and tagging efficiencies above 1%. The R&D work funded with this award builds on such breakthroughs and aspires to provide the first demonstration of high efficiency tagging of individual Ba atoms in liquid xenon. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: While the primary scientific goal of this proposal is in the field of neutrino physics, its broader impact is substantial. The techniques being developed span a range of topics, from nuclear and particle astrophysics, to AMO, surface physics and material science. This research, if successful, is likely to be applicable to other problems in science and technology, where the high efficiency transfer and identification of single atoms would be of interest. Examples include trace analysis for homeland security applications and the detection of rare phenomena. The team is also planning to continue the summer program integrating high school teachers into their labs."
0.215893,"This grant is for fundamental research on the statistical properties of wave functions and quantum transport in systems with a non-integrable classical limit. Experiments and applications motivating this work come from fields as diverse as current flow through two-dimensional nanostructures, rogue wave formation in the ocean, Coulomb blockade conductance in quantum dots, microwaves in irregularly-shaped electromagnetic resonators, energy transport in large structural acoustic systems, chemical reaction statistics, asymmetric optical resonators, and Casimir forces for nontrivial geometries. Interrelated research topics are: (1) Branched Flow Through Weak Correlated Random Potentials and Rogue Waves in the Ocean. Extreme event statistics are of particular interest in the context of ocean wave dynamics. The PI has obtained analytical results for the rogue wave formation probability as a function of sea parameters and will extend these techniques to include nonlinear wave evolution, finite wavelength effects, and depth variation in coastal waters, bringing closer the long-term goal of rogue wave forecasting. Similarities with other physical systems will enable improved understanding of branched flow in electron, microwave, and light scattering. (2)Chaotic Wave Functions Beyond the Random Matrix and Semiclassical Approximations: the PI has developed a robust and accurate method for extending random matrix theory predictions by systematically incorporating the non-universal short-time behavior of chaotic or diffusive systems. These techniques will be extended to general Hamiltonian systems in arbitrary dimension and to resonance wave function statistics in open systems. He will incorporate symmetry effects (including time reversal symmetry), explore the consequences of mixed classical phase space and the effects of Anderson localization. Applications include interaction matrix elements in ballistic and diffusive quantum dots, as well as energy transport in acoustic systems. (3) Vacuum Energy and Casimir Forces in Non-Integrable Geometries: The PI will investigate the vacuum self-energy in pseudointegrable and chaotic cavities in two and three dimensions. Of particular interest are the validity of the semiclassical approximations; the role of boundaries, edges, and corners; conditions under which divergences cancel between the inside and outside of a thin shell; and the relationship between the total self-energy and the local energy density. (4) Long-Time Semiclassical Accuracy: A common thread linking the above themes is the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation for long-time dynamics and eigenstates. The PI has shown previously that semiclassics at long times is more accurate in chaotic than in regular systems in two dimensions. He will apply these methods to higher-dimensional and interacting systems, and to higher-order semiclassical approximations, obtaining analytical estimates for the breakdown of the approximation in chaotic systems. Semiclassical error results will be extended to include caustics and diffraction effects. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of the project include: Undergraduate involvement in research, with active participation of underrepresented groups, utilizing diversity-enhancement programs such as LSAMP and development of research ties with Xavier University; enhancing research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students through direct stipend support, professional development through travel to conferences, and active participation in external collaborations; development of a new course in Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics, targeted toward upper division undergraduate and beginning graduate students, in collaboration with faculty in mathematics and engineering; teaching of relevant introductory graduate courses in quantum and classical mechanics, with emphasis on classical quantum correspondence; and continuation of effective, highly rated teaching of physics for liberal arts majors, with a focus on modern physics and applications."
0.546675,"Gravitational Wave (GW) Astronomy promises to provide a revolutionary new view of the universe that can probe previously unexplorable regions, including the interiors of neutron stars, collisions of black holes, which emit energy at luminosities exceeding the entire visible universe, and even remnants of the big bang. However, the challenges are significant because the GW signals will be hidden in orders of magnitude larger noise. To gain new insight into the dynamics of the universe, GW astronomers need to be able to infer the nature of the sources from the observed signals. However, the physical parameters of these sources can only be extracted from the observed signals if the dependence of the waveform on source parameters is known to high-accuracy. The success of the GW astronomy efforts therefore depends critically on advancements in Numerical Relativity (NR). This award funds the well-established research program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) to model merging black hole binaries in the highly-nonlinear regime, which are among the loudest sources for aLIGO/AdVirgo. We focus on binaries in the technically difficult small-mass-ratio, highly-spinning, and highly-precessing regimes, which requires new developments in code optimization, new gauge conditions (especially gauge conditions adapted for the high-spin regime), non-conformally flat initial data for high spins and linear momentum, as well as hybrid numerical/perturbative techniques that will allow us to model a large range of binaries using relatively few numerical simulations. Our principle goals will be to produce waveforms from these extreme binaries of sufficient accuracy for aLIGO/AdVirgo GW data analysis, and to model the gravitational radiation recoil (as well as remnant mass and spins) from highly-precessing binaries in order to elucidate the distributions of these recoils and how they affect the distribution and growth of supermassive black holes. This research is very timely now that aLIGO is scheduled to come online in 2015. <br/><br/>Our research will directly benefit the aLIGO/AdVirgo project, the NINJA and NRAR projects, and an emerging new field in astrophysics: The search for the observational consequences of merging and recoiling black holes. The research proposed here will complement other ongoing projects of our NR group to include matter and magnetic fields in our vacuum general relativistic code in order to study EM counterparts to compact-object mergers and to model accretion disk dynamics near supermassive black holes. This award will not only enable the PIs to enhance their research program, but it will also be used to greatly enhance the research effort at RIT as a whole. The award supports graduate student research in RIT's PhD Astronomy program and a proposed new PhD program in 'Modeling and Computation'. Importantly, our research will be the focus of our new partnership with RIT's National Technical Institute for the Deaf on an NSF-funded project that combines innovative dance and theater performances to promote science to the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Visualizations will also be a vehicle for public outreach events on science, mathematics, and computing through site visits and annual community-wide public exhibits like 'ImagineRIT'."
0.767697,"A better understanding of the relationship between brain structure and function is an integral component of the on-going efforts aimed at developing a better understanding of the human mind. Fundamental research is required to accelerate the development of new technologies for neuroscience and near engineering in order to address important societal needs with respect to the development of new ways to treat, prevent, and cure brain disorders. In this larger context, this collaborative project will extend methods of statistical physics to bridge from microscopic neurobiological observations of neurons, axons and dendrites to the mesoscopic images of brain organization seen in diffusion MRI images of the entire primate brain. A particular focus will be to address the question of how the processes of the brain might exploit this special architecture for the representation and processing of information, and in particular, how this regular structure might support time-coding and synchronization of information across the brain.<br/><br/>Joining a physics laboratory, a neurobiology laboratory, and an MRI laboratory, this team will investigates the hypothesis that brain connectivity is geometrically organized, with connectivity generally aligned with the axes of a curved, but essentially orthogonal coordinate system or 3D grid. The idea that the brain of all species with bilateral symmetry is based on an orthogonal plan is not new. It has been recognized in embryology and evolutionary biology for nearly 100 years and more recently has been validated in detail in studies of gene expression. Preliminary studies have suggested that this orthogonal motif pervades the structure of the brain, and particularly connectivity, from macroscopic down to a cellular level. In this interdisciplinary project, the investigators will quantify this phenomenon by looking at structural data from both diffusion MRI and advanced methods of 3D light microscopy and then apply the ideas and tools of condensed matter physics to characterize the structure and circuits of the brain as organized matter. As a first example, having observed 3 orthogonal fiber directions at each point in the brain that vary smoothly, it is natural to model this as a liquid crystal with a deformation energy and temperature. Then, one can investigate its scaling in the brain, and transitions such as those from white matter to gray matter. Functionally, we hypothesize that this rectilinear grid, may provide a new mechanism for neural activity to be temporally correlated, owing to its extremely high degeneracy of path lengths and transmission delays, which we will model as a directed percolation."
0.135706,"Muons are very much like the familiar electron, with many of the same characteristics (e.g. intrinsic spin and electric charge) but approximately 200 times more mass. Those similarities and that difference make muons a sensitive tool for exploring new physics and will be exploited in two experiments supported by this award: the MuSun experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institut (Villigen, Switzerland) and on the muon g-2 experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL,, near Chicago). Proton-proton fusion is the initial nuclear reaction in a chain of reactions which are the source of the energy produced by our sun. The rate of this fusion reaction cannot be measured in the laboratory nor has it been calculated from first principles. In the MuSun experiment, muons will be used to study something like proton-proton fusion in reverse. When a muon is captured by a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a neutron and a proton, the deuterium breaks apart into a pair of neutrons and a muon neutrino. The measurement of muon capture by deuterium will provide the necessary information to make possible a first principles calculation. That calculation will also provide a more solid theoretical foundation for the results concerning neutrino characteristics. The new muon g-2 experiment at FNAL aims to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with unprecedented precision. Because the muon has intrinsic angular momentum (spin) and an electric charge, it also possesses a magnetic moment, that is, it behaves like a tiny magnet. The relationship between the angular momentum and magnetic moment is described by the gyromagnetic ratio or g factor. For the electron and the muon, g is very slightly greater than 2. This difference from 2 is the so-called anomaly. The anomaly, for both electrons and muons, can be measured and calculated with great precision. Any significant disagreement between the two is a hint of new physics.<br/><br/>The technique for measuring the capture rate is simple. Negative muons are stopped in a detector filled with ultra-pure deuterium gas. The experiment will measure the disappearance rate of the muons, similar to any radioactive decay experiment. Because of the capture process, the disappearance rate will be slightly larger than that of free muon decay to electrons plus neutrinos (of both electron and muon types) - the difference is the capture rate. The sensitivity goal of 1.5 percent on the capture rate will require the collection of approximately 20 billion muon disappearance events. To measure the anomaly, muons are injected into a storage ring, a doughnut shaped device, roughly 44 m in circumference, which guides them in roughly circular orbits. As the muons circle the storage ring, their spin vectors, which act like gyroscopes, turn faster than their momentum vectors. The rate of the precession, which is extracted from the time distribution of muon decay electrons, is directly proportional to the anomaly. The experimental goal, a fractional error on the anomaly of approximately one part in ten million, should provide a stringent test of possible new physics."

The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate students who are actively involved in research and postdocs (within 2 years of their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to nurture future scientists so that the community will have sufficient manpower to effectively use the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online. In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the elements to the enhancement of national security."
0.299999,"This project will foster collaborations between physicists, mathematicians and neuroscientists to generate theoretical frameworks and statistical tools to interpret genomic, anatomical and physiological data on brain function. A community of researchers will be built through development of a seminar series for discussions of problems in which the theoretical approaches of physics, mathematics and statistics can be brought to be bear on specific research questions regarding neural systems. In addition, a set of pilot projects will be funded to foster collaborations between mathematicians, physicists and neuroscientists. Specific pilot projects will use the techniques of theoretical physics to address problems of understanding large scale functional anatomical connectivity, with the objective of identifying constraints on the distance and pattern of inter-areal connectivity in the human brain. Pilot projects will also develop a theoretical framework for understanding neural activity on different time scales during behavior, with the objective of understanding the unifying neural principles underlying human memory behavior over time scales from seconds to minutes to hours. Pilot projects will also develop mathematical and statistical techniques to identify molecular networks underlying specific features of neural function, with the objective of identifying specific network modules in the prefrontal cortex. These pilot projects will provide example interactions that can be expanded to further build a community of interaction of physicists, mathematicians and neuroscientists. <br/><br/>The maturation of scientific fields such as physics required the development of sophisticated theoretical frameworks to account for experimental phenomena at multiple different scales of analysis ranging from particle physics to condensed matter physics to astrophysics. The maturation of neuroscience as a field will require similarly sophisticated theoretical frameworks that effectively account for data at the different levels including the genomic, physiological and behavioral levels. Current theories of single neuron function have not yet been effectively extended to address physiological phenomena at the circuit and population level or the behavioral function of these network dynamics. The pilot projects in this grant will attempt to develop theoretical frameworks for addressing these multiple levels of analysis. The intellectual merit of the proposal will be the application of mathematical and statistical techniques to the interpretation of neuroscience data, including the development of theoretical models to account for existing data and to guide the design of future experiments. The field of neuroscience needs more extensive development of a theoretical framework for understanding the structure and function of neural systems at different levels, including genomic, physiological and behavioral. Successful interactions in the pilot projects could provide a model for further interaction of physicists, mathematicians, and neuroscientists throughout the field. More specifically, these pilot projects will provide a framework for development of new theories for analyzing the connectivity patterns of neural systems, the dynamics of brain function underlying behavior, and the molecular networks underlying these neural properties. The resources provided by this grant will serve to recruit additional mathematicians and physicists to address relevant questions concerning brain function.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical sciences."
0.225,"This award investigates how very intense lasers excite atoms and molecules, using laboratory experiments and theoretical modeling. The work supports three thrust areas that affect intellectual merit and the broader impact: applied optical technology, fundamental high intensity laser science, and next generation global competitiveness for individuals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the United States. Applied optical technology is addressed with the unique, trillion watt peak power lasers in the research. These lasers generate some of the highest intensities of visible and ultraviolet light realized in the lab. The contribution to scientific knowledge comes about by addressing how intense light excites elements (e.g. lithium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen) and polymer hydrocarbons (e.g. methane, propane). Specifically, the research probes high energy electron dynamics and ion fragmentation in intense laser-matter interactions. Special attention is given to quantifying how many of the electrons most tightly bound to the nucleus are excited. The measurements are made possible by the investment in new scientific laboratory apparatus designed to probe highly accelerated (e.g. million volt) electrons and record the complex ion fragmentation. The theory effort uses large scale (supercomputer) trajectory ensembles to model excitation and relativistic effects in the interaction. The outcomes are relevant to disciplines including plasma physics, fusion energy, physical chemistry, atomic physics, and optical science. The research addresses efforts to develop new laser sources and attosecond science, which directly measure how electrons move in atoms and molecules.<br/><br/>The high field research in the award is pursued by the international community; students involved in this research are exposed to international efforts in optics and laser science. As part of a broader impact, the award strives to improve global competitiveness for the next STEM generation in the United States. The experiments and theory in the award provides intensive training for graduate and undergraduate students on applied and fundamental topics including ultrafast optics, laser pulse diagnostics, computer programming, data acquisition hardware, laser alignment, opto-mechanical design, collision physics, and electron dynamics in atomic and molecular systems.

0.413999,"Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.<br/><br/>The science of IceCube is broad and interdisciplinary. As a consequence, there are several opportunities for collaboration with other experiments. Of special interest at Delaware is the connection with solar and heliospheric physics. The counting rates in IceTop are highly sensitive to changes in solar activity as it affects the flux of cosmic rays arriving at Earth. The relevant data from IceTop sensors are posted online in near real time in the context of other, complementary measures of solar activity. Delaware participates in the IceCube Master Class program for high school students, and hosts local students for research experience.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this award is to study the high-energy cosmic-ray events detected by IceCube including IceTop. IceTop is the surface component of IceCube, with a pair of ice-filled tanks near the top of each down-hole cable. Each tank is instrumented with two digital optical modules (DOMs) integrated into the overall IceCube data acquisition system. This award also contributes to the main mission of IceCube, which is to study high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin. A key aspect for astrophysical neutrinos is to understand the background due to neutrinos produced at Earth by interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere. The astrophysical neutrinos are produced by interactions of cosmic rays in distant, energetic astrophysical sources. Both in neutrino astronomy and in cosmic-ray physics, the goal is to understand the origin and acceleration mechanisms of high-energy particles in Nature."
0.18,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Orlando Alvarez and Rafael Nepomechie at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.<br/><br/>The Standard Model that describes the known elementary particles is an example of a gauge theory. The still-unsolved problem of computing the hadron spectrum (the masses of protons, etc.) is an example of a strong-coupling problem in gauge theory. The discovery that certain gauge theories are equivalent to corresponding string theories, i.e., the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence, has revolutionized theoretical physics, since it offers a way to address such difficult strong-coupling problems. An important development has been the discovery and exploitation of integrability in AdS/CFT, which could lead to exact solutions of these theories. Professor Nepomechie's main objective is to apply techniques of integrable quantum spin chains and integrable quantum field theories to problems in gauge/string theory. In parallel, one of the big challenges in theoretical physics is why the gravitational force is very weak relative to the other basic forces. Professor Alvarez will therefore study a class of field theoretic models where there is no gravity in spacetime. These theories do not have a fundamental graviton, the quantum responsible for the gravitational force. What is interesting about these theories is that on lower-dimensional surfaces (the so-called branes) sitting inside the spacetime there is an induced weak theory of gravity. The gravitons only exist on the low-dimensional surface as an excitation of the geometry of the surface. <br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. This work may open new directions in string theory and mathematics. Both Professors Alvarez and Nepomechie will provide scientific training to the next generation of scientists in Miami and also in Africa at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in Cape Town, South Africa. Their research findings will be disseminated through the internet and scientific publications, as well as through seminars and international conferences. The PI's will also give public lectures on their research at local schools and community centers."
0.3,"This project explores how information processing by neural circuits is organized to use the resources of the brain efficiently. The proposed theoretical studies apply fundamentally new approaches to analyzing the organization of cortical maps, by investigating how emerging principles of efficient design pertain to the computational mechanisms employed by the central brain. One aim studies how the ""place map"" in the hippocampus (where individual cells are tuned to fire in particular locations of an environment) should be organized to efficiently support general goal-directed navigation. A second aim studies how the ""shape map"" in Inferotemporal Cortex (where individual cells are tuned to fire in response to particular visual shapes) should be organized to efficiently support shape perception, given the distribution of shapes in natural visual scenes. These theoretical studies will lead to directly testable predictions of the distribution of tuning curves in cortical area IT and hippocampus. In this way, the theory will provide a lever for further experimental exploration of the architecture of form vision and spatial navigation in the brain. Population codes also involve interactions between the different neurons, but techniques are not yet available to comprehensively study these interactions in cortex. Thus, a third aim uses the retina (a piece of the central brain that has projected out into the eye) as a model system to theoretically and experimentally ask two basic, and as yet unanswered questions: (a) Do neural networks adapt their interactions to stimulus statistics and noise as predicted by optimization theory?; (b) Is noise, as measured from single neurons, simply a mis-reading of correlated activity? By asking and answering these questions, this project will also explain key aspects of how the retina prepares visual input for central processing. Knowledge of how retinal circuits respond to natural and synthetic stimuli will be useful in designing effective prosthetic devices. <br/><br/>This project strengthens the research connections between disciplines by bringing together analytical and theoretical methods from physics and machine learning with experimental techniques from neuroscience. Students and postdocs who thus develop proficiency with both biological and quantitative physical techniques will be better able to cope with scientific and industrial challenges of coming decades. The educational component of this proposal also addresses this national need directly by developing pedagogical materials for a course on ""Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience"". The PI will give presentations to K-8 and high school students and to the general public with a view to broadening public knowledge of the field. Outreach to historically disadvantaged communities will be carried out through established programs at Penn. Finally, the PI is active in organizing lecture series and conferences that engage physicists to work within quantitative systems neuroscience."

0.91175,"RNA directed RNA polymerases (RdRp) play a central role in the life cycle of RNA viruses. The catalytic activity of these enzymes is regulated at two levels: first, through conformational transitions occurring on the catalytic timescale allowing the enzyme to attain a state capable of RNA polymerization; second, through regulatory interactions with other proteins in the context of a multi-protein RNA polymerase complex. The proposed research, through a combination of biophysical/structural studies and biochemical/functional assays, will elucidate the nature and importance of these two levels of regulation in a bacteriophage RdRp. The multidisciplinary nature of the research will provide training for students from various backgrounds at multiple stages of their professional preparation. These efforts will be in line with the overarching mission of the City College of New York to provide a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic research and training environment that is inclusive of groups underrepresented in the sciences including minorities and women. In order to strengthen the pipeline of students from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in the STEM disciplines, the PI will refine and expand his outreach activities to several New York area high schools including one situated in one of the poorest congressional districts in the country.<br/><br/> Biochemical studies on viral RdRps have indicated that specific conformational changes at the polymerase active site influence the rate of nucleotide addition during the elongation stage of RNA polymerization. The nature of these conformational changes remains unknown despite the availability of crystal structures of several viral RdRps. The proposed research will resolve this longstanding problem by combining solution NMR to probe dynamics on the millisecond timescale with measurements of nucleotide addition kinetics. These complimentary sources of data, NMR dynamics and fast kinetics, interpreted within the framework of the available crystal structures and others to be determined, will provide a clear structural and dynamic view of RdRp-catalyzed nucleic acid polymerization in RNA viruses. Comparison of two distantly related enzymes (from bacteriophage phi-12 and poliovirus) will allow generalization to a broad class of viral RdRps. In addition to dynamics, protein-protein interactions within polymerase complexes exert higher order control over the activity of their constituent RdRps. Modifications in these interactions lead to altered RdRp function, and in extreme cases to non-infectious viruses. The proposed studies will define these regulatory interactions in the context of phi-12 that contains a simple 4-protein polymerase complex. The results obtained will be generalizable to more complex RNA viruses.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry."
0.114183,"This MRI grant will help support the development of a particle detector being built by an international collaboration of scientists. The primary objective for the experiment using this detector is the search for new and exotic forms of matter. Regular matter is made from protons, neutrons and electrons. Many other types of particles are known, but some short-lived particles are predicted to exist from theoretical models of the theory of the strong force, called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). When high-energy photons strike a proton target, many particles are produced, and some of these may be the predicted exotic particles such as glueballs or hybrid mesons. <br/><br/>In the process of developing this instrumentation, physicists train students in the use of high-technology equipment and electronics. Some of these students go on to develop new uses of the technology, such as the diagnostic equipment used in many hospitals, including MRI, CAT and PET scanners. The economic impact of a highly-trained workforce is well-documented. The development of this equipment will train students with high technology skills that are needed in today's marketplace, while adding to our understanding of QCD."

0.04756,"Understanding how the brain works is arguably the largest intellectual challenge of the 21st century. This effort requires a variety of existing and future technologies targeted at fundamental neuroscience questions. The network of national laboratories,one of the largest investments in science by the federal government, already contain technologies that could make a significant impact on neuroscience research along with the capabilities to design and deploy at scale future technologies for brain investigation. This meeting of leading neuroscientists will identify the specific intellectual challenges that can be addressed in the coming decades with collaboration with the network of national laboratories.<br/><br/>Developing technologies to understand how the human brain works has emerged as a major international focus of the BRAIN initiative. It is also self-evident that the long-lasting success of the BRAIN initiative will depend on widespread access to the technological advancements, computational tools, and data-sets created by the initiative. However, there are no existing mechanisms for providing national access to the increasingly technologically and computationally oriented investigations of the brain. The PI proposes to organize a one-day meeting to bring together neuroscientists from the community, scientists from the National Laboratories, and private and public funding organizations to determine the utility of creating a National Brain Observatory. The goal of the meeting is to identifying key problem areas in neuroscience where technologies found at national labs can be used for the BRAIN initiative and develop a pipeline for future conversations and collaborations between scientists from the National Laboratories and the larger neuroscience community. Panels of neuroscientists with expertise in different experimental approaches will identify important long-term goals that could require the resources of the national lab system and would transform their respective fields and drive progress across neuroscience. In addition, many important questions in neuroscience cannot be pursued with current tools. Bringing together neuroscientists and national lab scientists should catalyze discussions that spur us towards transformative new methodologies."
0.47,"The field of optomechanics has progressed rapidly in the past few years from proof-of-principle demonstrations of coupling between optical and mechanical systems to the observation of quantum effects in a handful of these devices. During the same period, connections between optomechanical systems and other AMO systems such as ultracold atoms and diamond NV centers have emerged as promising routes towards controlling quantum information in hybrid systems. In this project, we are working to extend both of these efforts by realizing a new type of optomechanical system capable of reaching the quantum regime while also playing host to cold molecules strongly coupled to an optical cavity. The devices we are building will also be substantially more robust and compact than existing optomechanical devices.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, we are using high finesse optical cavities filled with superfluid helium. The cavities are formed between a pair of optical fibers. Precision-machined glass ferrules are being used to align the fibers and to contain the superfluid. The mechanical element will be the vibrational modes of the superfluid helium filling the space between the two fibers. This design eliminates all mechanical alignments, and should result in a very stable device. Numerical estimates suggest that this device will provide access to a range of quantum phenomena, including observations of the zero-point motion of the superfluid modes, the generation of squeezed light, and measurements of the quantum back action of an optical displacement measurement. In addition, we are exploring the optomechanical properties of superfluid-vacuum interfaces by filling the cavity only partially with superfluid.<br/><br/>Superfluid helium can play host to a variety of atom-like systems (such as metastable helium dimer moledules and electron bubbles) that can interact with both the optical cavity and the sound waves in the helium. Combining optomechanics with such atom-like systems would greatly enhance the versatility of these devices. We are using these superfluid optomechanical devices to study the quantum limits of measurements, and to produce ultrastable light for use in instruments operating at the quantum limit of sensitivity. This work is also providing valuable training for graduate students in laser optics, cryogenics, low-noise measurements, signal processing, data analysis, and quantum optics. This training will allow them to pursue basic and applied research in a wide variety of settings."
3.646103,"The goal of this project is to search for a new fundamental property of the electron, one of the main constituents of matter and a charged component of all atoms. This new property, called an electric dipole moment, can be described as a slight bulge on an otherwise perfect sphere of charge. This seemingly abstruse property may hold the key to one of the most fundamental mysteries of nature: why is everything in the universe made of matter rather than of antimatter? In accelerator laboratories, whenever energy is converted into particles (according to E=mc2), equal numbers of matter particles and antimatter particles are created. For example, the electron has a counterpart antimatter particle, the anti-electron, which has identical mass but opposite electric charge. Energy can be converted into an electron/anti-electron pair, and conversely an electron and anti-electron can annihilate each other and turn into energy. Just after the Big Bang, energy was converted into particles and anti-particles. Astronomical observations show that since then, essentially all the antimatter annihilated with matter--but a tiny bit of matter was left over. That small excess makes up all of the objects seen in the Universe today. The current framework that describes all known fundamental forces between elementary particles, known as the ""Standard Model"", cannot explain how this excess of matter survived. However, many mathematical theories have been devised that can explain this ""matter-antimatter asymmetry"", by positing new forces and particles not yet discovered in any experiment. These same new forces and particles also often lead, according to the same theories, to an electric dipole moment that is large enough to observe in the experiment supported here. Hence, this project is essentially seeking an answer to the question: how is it that matter was slightly preferred over anti-matter at some time in the past, resulting in the physical Universe seen today? In a general sense, this project also advances the range of techniques for precision measurement science, which in the past has led to unexpected breakthroughs in technology such as GPS (the Global Positioning System), new types of sensors, etc. <br/><br/> The electric dipole moment (EDM), if it exists, must lie along the spin axis of the electron. In the presence of a nonzero EDM, an electric field will induce a torque on the electron, resulting in precession of the spin about the field. This spin precession angle is the experimental signal. The huge internal electric field of a polar molecule, ThO, is used to amplify this observable effect. The internal structure of ThO also suppresses possible systematic errors. A cryogenic molecular beam source that delivers an unprecedented high flux of molecules is used. Lasers and optical techniques put the ThO molecules in usable coherent superpositions and then probe the quantum interference that signals the electron's spin precession. Over the previous grant period, an initial version of these methods was used to make by far the most sensitive measurement of the electron's EDM. This result was consistent with a zero value for the EDM, but many theories of what lies beyond the Standard Model of particle physics predict that, with improved sensitivity, detection of the EDM is likely. In this project, methods to greatly improve the sensitivity of the experiment will be introduced; these include focusing of the molecular beam and a use of a more efficient process for state preparation, based on adiabatic passage. Improvements such as the use of low-absorption optical elements will reduce systematic errors observed in the previous experiment."
0.073334,"Epidermal growth factor gradient sensing by epithelial cells is a crucial process in development and many disease processes such as cancer metastasis. Understanding the basic principles of this sensing would enable us to intervene in disease processes that involve directional cell motion by pharmacologically targeting the communication rather than the within-cell regulation, and it can stimulate a novel direction for therapeutics. Through a combination of novel experimental and theoretical approaches, this project will characterize advantages and limitations of multicellular gradient sensing in breast epithelial tissue in a mouse model. It will explore the fundamental physical limits on collective gradient sensing and will establish to which extent the size of multicellular ensembles aids their sensory precision. The project will also support synergistic curriculum development efforts on the interface of physics and biology at three research universities, on levels from introductory undergraduate to advanced graduate. It will provide research and broader career training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, including minority students. The PIs will engage elementary school students in science projects and they will reach out to the general public disseminating their research findings at the Atlanta Science Festival.<br/><br/>Cells in multicellular organisms rarely act alone in responding to external signals, but little is known about behaviors that emerge from their multicellular, collective communication and action. In particular it is unknown if multicellular ensembles can collectively sense chemical gradients in ways that take advantage of such ensembles spanning substantial ranges of the chemo-attractant concentration. The PIs' experiments with multicellular ensembles of breast epithelial cells exposed to gradients of epidermal growth factor suggest that these cells can sense gradients collectively and that collectively cells respond to gradients that are far smaller than those sensed by individual cells. This multicellular information processing is fundamentally distinct from, and not simply reducible to, sensory processes in isolated cells. The PIs will establish theoretically and verify experimentally the fundamental physical limits on the precision of gradient sensing by multicellular ensembles. These limits containing contributions from the extrinsic ligand stochasticity and from the intrinsic noise in communicating the measurements made by distant cells in a multicellular group to individual cells within the group will be characterized. The PIs will develop computational methods to analyze precision of biological information processing in collective, nonlinear phenomena, such as epithelial tissue rearrangement, which will be applicable broadly in other biophysical contexts."
0.278,"Astrophysical observations and cosmological data have led to the unambiguous conclusion that nearly a quarter of the Universe consists of dark matter. The search for dark matter addresses one of the fundamental questions in particle astrophysics. Current models predict that our galaxy is encased in a halo of dark matter. As the Sun orbits around the galaxy and the Earth around the Sun, we expect there to be an annual modulation in the flux of dark matter that passes through the Earth. If the modulation observed by the DAMA experiment in Italy is due to dark matter, an experiment in the Southern Hemisphere with the same target material would expect to observe modulations with the same phase and amplitude. This would be unambiguous evidence for the observation of dark matter. If the modulation is due to an environmental background related to the seasons, it will be opposite in the two hemispheres.<br/><br/>This award will fund an integrated research and education program focused on the development of sodium iodide-(NaI)-based detectors for dark matter physics. The research program consists of three main activities: analysis of data from a 17 kilogram NaI detector currently operating 2500 meters below the surface in the South Pole ice, a systematic study of the characteristics and pulse shape discrimination techniques of NaI detectors, and the simulations and sensitivity studies for a proposed 250 kilogram NaI detector to be mounted in the Southern Hemisphere. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This award will also fund a series of educational and outreach activities designed to recruit and retain physics majors and physicists in STEM fields by showcasing the wide range of careers available to physicists. A special focus will be given to recruit and retain women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in physics."
0.5645,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model has succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date has been recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions, for example why there is a preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to such open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are elementary particles that barely interact with anything else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they would undergo whenever they would interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino measurements, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. There have also been possible hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos (called sterile neutrinos), and building the critical instruments to clarify such ""hints"" is one of the main thrusts of the work in this project.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The work proposed here is to develop a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) for the LAr1-ND Experiment. This detector technique is powerful in that it allows the experimenter to distinguish between electrons and photons, important for the understanding of the character of neutrino interactions and neutrino oscillations. At Fermilab, the LAr1-ND experiment, along with a companion experiment called MicroBooNE, should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether hypothesized ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This research program will serve as an invaluable proving ground for LAr TPC technology and in the reconstruction and analysis techniques that will be needed to make future experiments a success. The construction effort at the three collaborating institutions Yale, Syracuse and Chicago will enable students and postdocs at each institution to participate and acquire invaluable hands-on experience with advanced detector technology that is a vital component of training scientists in the field of high-energy physics."
0.33,"Intellectual merit: This award is for a program on fundamental experiments in quantum optics using superconducting integrated circuits. Based on the paradigm of ""circuit QED"" developed by the PI's group, in which superconducting qubits are combined with microwave resonant cavities to realize the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model with ultra-strong coupling, we are pursuing the generation, manipulation, and measurement of non-classical states of the electromagnetic field. Using the tools developed for quantum information processing with superconducting devices, we have realized a new 3D version of a ""two-cavity"" circuit architecture with significantly extended coherence times during the current funding period. Here a single qubit, which provides nonlinearity, is combined with two microwave cavities, allowing new possibilities for nonlinear optics at the single quantum level. We have been able to use these devices to observe new quantum phenomena, such as the single-photon Kerr regime, and to manipulate states of microwave fields in new ways. We have the ability to create interesting non-classical states, including the largest ""Schrodinger cat states"" (superpositions of Glauber coherent states) ever produced, and measure them with full Wigner state tomography. This opens new possibilities for employing cavities and the physics of continuous variables in quantum information processing. Our main goal with this architecture is to develop real-time quantum non-demolition measurements capable of detecting single quantum jumps, and utilize this to actively stabilize states and perform quantum error correction. The physics and capabilities developed here can have significant impact on the prospects for scalable quantum information processing with solid-state devices.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: This work opens a new area for fundamental studies of the quantum measurement of the electromagnetic field, as well as to develop new technology for integrated circuits which operate at the single quantum level. The experiments employ the novel features of the circuit QED system to observe and study phenomena which are mostly inaccessible with traditional AMO systems in quantum optics. The techniques and capabilities for single photon generation and detection could have major impact on the prospects for scalable quantum computation and communication in these superconducting circuits and also atomic/condensed matter hybrid systems such as ion and molecule chips. This project also continues the trend established by earlier work to forge new connections between atomic and condensed matter physics communities. The project supports graduate student research. Results will be disseminated via publications and presentations at conferences in the areas of AMO physics, quantum information, and condensed matter physics, as well as in tutorials and introductory lectures at summer schools and conferences. This research will take advantage of the infrastructure and technical knowledge for fabrication and measurement of superconducting devices developed as part of the large, applied effort for development of quantum computing at Yale, but allows new and distinct directions of fundamental physical interest."
0.795385,"Astrophysical and cosmological data point convincingly to a large component of cold dark matter in the Universe, but the nature of that dark matter is still unknown. Axions are possible dark matter candidates. This award will support the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment - High Frequency (ADMX-HF), which searches for Axions in the galactic halo. ADMX-HF extends the range of the ADMX experiment to the higher frequency band that probes both Axions with trace mass and Axions with sufficient mass to account for all the matter density in the Universe. ADMX-HF is therefore a uniquely powerful probe of Axion dark matter. Several new technologies have been developed in support of ADMX-HF. These have potential applications for high-precision measurements in other fields. The group has a history of employing undergraduates in the research, which provides training and experience in the areas of experimental control and data analysis software, mechanical and electronic assembly.<br/><br/>Axions in the galactic halo can be converted into a narrow-band microwave signal by an apparatus consisting of a microwave-cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. ADMX-HF is a small microwave cavity experiment that serves as both a pathfinder to take first data in the 10 to 100 micro-electronvolt range and as a test-bed for developing new cavities and quantum-limited photon detection schemes that could be migrated to the larger ADMX platform. All major systems have been constructed and are being integrated into the experiment with full commissioning to begin soon. During this award period ADMX-HF should transition to routine data-taking operation and probe the 16.5 to 66 micro-electronvolt range, bracketing the mass of the axion that corresponds to saturation of the matter density of the universe."
0.08,"This award funds the research activities of Senior Research Scientist George T. Fleming of Yale University, who is co-spokesperson of the Lattice Strong Dynamics (LSD) collaboration. In 2012, physicists from around the world working on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) announced the discovery of the long-sought Higgs boson, for which the Nobel prize was awarded the following year. As theoretical particle physicists applaud the discovery, they are also quite confused that no new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) was discovered along with the Higgs boson. So, it remains a mystery how the Higgs boson avoids the effects of quantum gravity, which would make it much heavier than has been observed. This mystery could be solved if the Higgs boson turned out to be a composite particle in much the same way as protons and neutrons are composites made of quarks and gluons, rendering it immune to the effects of quantum gravity. There has been no direct evidence that such a composite scalar could exist until recently, when the LatKMI group of the Kobayashi-Maskawa Institute in Nagoya, Japan announced the first calculation of a light composite scalar consistent with the Higgs boson. As leader of the LSD collaboration, Dr. Fleming is working to confirm this scenario by repeating and improving upon the calculation of the LatKMI group. Lattice gauge theory (LGT) calculations of many physical observables essentially involve extracting exponentially decaying signals from noisy time series data generated in Monte Carlo simulations. Many other scientific fields, e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, signals processing, share common challenges in data analysis of exponential time series. Undergraduates often choose this research topic because the skills they learn remain useful even if they don't continue to work on LGT later in their careers.<br/><br/>The LSD collaboration has begun generation of SU(3) gauge configuration ensembles with eight flavors of Dirac fermions in the fundamental representation. This strongly-coupled gauge theory has long been proposed as a candidate for Walking Technicolor. The calculation of the LatKMI group has shown that the theory contains a surprisingly light scalar particle consistent with the Higgs boson. Calculating the mass of this scalar particle is particularly challenging so the LatKMI result has rather large statistical errors. The LSD collaboration, with access to the Vulcan BG/Q supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL), can improve upon the existing calculation with improved statistics, larger physical volumes and smaller quark masses. This improved calculation will be a stringent test of whether this light scalar particle can be a viable composite Higgs candidate."
0.301065,"The scattering of high-energetic photons has been studied for many decades. The long interest in this endeavor is largely motivated by the study of nucleon and meson excitations, which manifest themselves as specific configurations of quarks or as gluonic excitation. The excitation of the glue that holds quarks and antiquarks closely together in mesons is predicted by the theory of strong interaction but has not been experimentally established. The GlueX experiment being constructed at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News, VA, will be devoted to the search for such excitation. By using a high-energetic, highly polarized photon beam and a high-resolution detector with complete angular coverage, the GlueX experiment is predetermined to settle the question. Through NSF support, CUA is able to proceed with constructing and maintaining the broad-band tagging hodoscope and the polarized photon source for this experiment. Moreover, for many years CUA has been a leading institution in the polarized target program at JLab, aimed to measure all components of the scattering amplitudes in form of polarization observables, and thus to disentangle unambiguously the resonant contributions to the scattering. The grant provided by NSF will also support CUA's continuing efforts in the analysis of data taken on frozen-spin targets in JLab's Hall B.<br/>Their research aims for settling long-standing questions in our understanding of nuclear matter, which is comprised of quarks and gluons. To this end they develop state-of-the-art equipment and advanced software packages. Students and postdoctoral researchers are strongly involved in this effort. Their training under professional guidance will strengthen their analytical competence and prepare them for responsible and leading positions in the modern technological society."
0.729,"The intellectual merit of this work is that it measures high-energy neutrino production in the universe and tests the standard model of particle physics thus increasing our fundamental knowledge of the high-energy universe. The origin of the highest energy cosmic-rays is one of the most compelling mysteries in modern physics. Air shower detectors have observed events with energies up to 3x10^20 electron volt (eV). However, despite decades of work, their sources, nuclear composition and acceleration mechanisms remain unknown. Some possible sources include active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursters, and/or supernova remnants. Observation of astrophysical neutrinos will tell us that hadrons must be accelerated in these sources; the neutrino flux and spectrum will significantly constrain theoretical models. <br/><br/>This award will support a search for the diffuse flux of neutrinos produced in these cosmic accelerators, using data from the recently completed IceCube detector. The work will be in two areas. The first is to search for a diffuse flux of electron and tau neutrinos. The group has demonstrated the power of using the outer strings and the top and bottom of IceCube to veto entering muon tracks by using it to measure the atmospheric electron neutrino flux from 50 gigaelectronvolt (GeV) to 10 teraelectronvolt (TeV). They will extend this technique to neutrinos with energies from 10 TeV up to ~ 1 petaelectronvolt (PeV). They will also search for a diffuse flux of high-energy tau neutrinos, through their distinctive topology - two separated cascades. Second, they will use these neutrinos to make a measurement of the neutrino-nucleon cross-section at an energy around 50 TeV - by measuring neutrino absorption in the Earth. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The observation of extra-terrestrial neutrinos will have broad significance for astrophysics. The observation of hadronic accelerators in the universe would answer one of the 11 questions posed in the National Research Council study on the Physics of the Universe: ""Where do ultra-high energy particles come from"" The Education and Outreach component will communicate this forefront research to students and the general public, through presentations at elementary through high schools and public lectures."
0.49,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Petr Horava, Mina Aganagic, Raphael Bousso and Yasunori Nomura at Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Berkeley. <br/><br/>In the first decade of the 21st century, we witnessed a remarkable convergence of the fundamental questions about the origin, structure and the future fate of our Universe. Now, in the middle of the second decade, we experience the exciting confrontation of the fundamental theoretical questions (what is the Universe made of? what are matter, energy, space and time?, etc.) with the experimental data which are now becoming available in experimental particle physics, observational cosmology and astrophysics. These experimental findings are in turn challenging the remarkable developments on the theoretical front. The co-PIs of this award will perform fundamental theoretical research at these crossroads of particle physics, quantum gravity, cosmology and string theory, confronting the experimental challenges from beyond the Standard Model, the ideas of the multiverse, the interface of string theory and condensed-matter physics, the nature of space and time, and the mathematical implications of topological strings. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. The significant broader impacts of this research include the training of students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists in the nation and the world. The fundamental questions addressed in this research are of deep interest to the general public, and the co-PIs will continue promoting the importance and excitement of fundamental science to the general public.<br/><br/>More specifically, Mina Aganagic will focus on the interplay of string theory and gauge theories with pure mathematics. She will study the refined topological string, the refined Chern-Simons theory and M-theory. Raphael Bousso will work on extracting predictions from the multiverse, and the interconnections of geometry, holography and information, as recently crystallized in the black-hole ""firewall"" conundrum. He will further study the string landscape and the holographic entropy bounds. Petr Horava will study quantum gravity, especially in the context known as ""Horava-Lifshitz gravity"" and its broad applications, including the puzzles of naturalness in particle phenomenology and cosmology, and implications to condensed-matter physics. He will apply methods of nonequilibrium field theory to quantum gravity and strings. Yasunori Nomura will work on ideas relevant to the recent and upcoming experiments, such as the LHC, with emphasis on supersymmetry breaking and its mediation, the origin and nature of dark matter, and the conceptual understanding of the implications of the multiverse for the TeV-scale physics. All four co-PIs will seek unexpected new opportunities for transformative interdisciplinary research in all areas related to theoretical particle physics."
0.42,"Particle accelerators and light sources are important tools for scientific discovery across many disciplines such as biomedical, biological, chemical, and physical sciences. Photocathodes with improved emission properties are desirable for certain next generation light sources, such as those based on Free Electron Laser (FEL) or Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) technologies. They are also needed for high-resolution microscopy tools such as Dynamic Transmission Electron Microscopy (DTEM) devices. Accelerators are also used by industry for a variety of manufacturing tasks. Thermionic cathodes are typically used for industrial accelerators, although the beam properties of photocathodes would in some applications be more desirable. Some examples are medical radiological accelerators, and electron beam machining and welding. The cost and complication of photocathode operation discourages their use in industry. A goal of this award is to apply a multidisciplinary research approach to discover methods to modify the photocathode surface to manipulate emission properties, making them cheaper to operate, or else improve their performance.<br/><br/>With this award, an investigation of the use of thin film deposition to modify photo-emissive surface properties in a systematic way will be carried out. Specifically, development of novel photocathodes including plasmonic cathodes with thin coatings, and thin epitaxial multilayered MgO/Ag/MgO structures is planned. It may be possible to make robust, high quantum efficiency metallic plasmonic nanostructured cathodes by deposition of a thin layer of material such as BaO on the surface. The goal is to manipulate the photocathode to operate at visible, rather than ultra-violet wavelengths, making the technology more accessible for industrial applications. The thin flanking layers of MgO utilized in multilayered MgO/Ag/MgO structures modify the surface band structure; and emission properties vary systematically with layer thickness. Previous research can be continued, both to investigate how robust these structures are in an accelerator environment, and to determine more fully how performance depends on properties such as the surface roughness."
0.7125,"This award provides continued support for the particle astrophysics group at the University of Chicago to participate in the operation and analysis of data from the Very Energetic Radiation- Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). VERITAS is an array of four 12-meter Cherenkov telescopes that use the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique to detect and characterize the flux of 50 Gigaelectronvolt (GeV) to 50 Teraelectronvolt (TeV) photons from astrophysical sources. The VERITAS project has been very successful over the past few years of operations providing important measurements of high-energy emission from supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, gamma-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei. A recently completed upgrade, which updates the telescope cameras and trigger systems, should lead to even greater sensitivity and promises to further accelerate the scientific output of the project.<br/><br/>The University of Chicago group has been a key participant in the VERITAS project since its inception. From design and construction to commissioning and operation and now to analysis and interpretation, Chicago has assumed leadership roles in all aspects of VERITAS. The specific scientific interests of the group involve the study of Galactic sources, including supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as more general questions in particle astrophysics. In addition, the group will work to develop new hardware and technologies suitable for use in the next generation of ground-based TeV gamma-ray observatory.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The field of TeV astronomy has impacts on many other fields of science, from the study of the high-energy particle acceleration to fundamental physics questions such as the nature of Dark Matter. The data from VERITAS have been combined with data at other wavelengths to provide unique insights into the high-energy processes powering astrophysical objects. The VERITAS project involves both graduate and undergraduate students in significant roles. There is a strong local outreach effort at the University of Chicago, which involves a successful partnership with Adler Planetarium for producing public lectures and classes for high school teachers. Finally, the continued development of the TeVCat resource will expand the visibility of TeV astrophysics beyond the high energy gamma-ray community."
0.232922,"In this project, the PI will study how proteins that bind to specific sequences in DNA find their target sequences. It is known that some DNA binding proteins first bind non-specifically to DNA and then diffuse one-dimensionally along the DNA until they find their target sequence. The name ""facilitated diffusion"" is used to describe this process. Although this behavior is thought to be generic, it has only been observed in a handful of systems. In addition, single molecule observations of this process often occur in complicated environments involving shear flow and non-equilibrium fluctuations in the DNA, conditions which have not been adequately included in quantitative models. The PI will use two single molecule experimental techniques he has developed in order to detect and characterize facilitated diffusion of type II restriction endonucleases, enzymes which cleave double stranded DNA. The first technique is a flow stretching assay, in which a surface immobilized DNA is stretched out by fluid drag forces on a bead which is attached to the free end of the DNA. The second technique employs single molecule TIRF imaging of fluorescently labeled proteins diffusing one-dimensionally along tethered DNAs. Numerical simulations will be employed to explain the experimental results. The PI has developed a numerical simulation of tethered DNAs in shear flow. This simulation will be extended to include diffusing DNA binding proteins, and the numerical model developed will be validated against experimental results. This project will produce more realistic models of in vitro facilitated diffusion which will assist in translating experimental results in these systems to biologically relevant conditions. Additionally, the project will contribute to the understanding of reaction-diffusion behavior in flow conditions encountered in microfluidic cells, a problem relevant to lab-on-a-chip applications. Performing this research at an undergraduate institution, the PI will train and employ undergraduate students in his lab. These students will be mentored in research, in scientific presentation skills (through poster presentations at scientific meetings) and in scientific writing (through authorship on publications resulting from this project). In addition, the PI has developed a simplified DNA tethering protocol for use in pedagogy. Two experimental modules for use in laboratory courses will be developed that use this method. The first will be implemented in the PI's introductory physics course, and will examine tethered Brownian motion and the mechanical properties of DNA. The second will be used in an introductory molecular biology course, and will focus on the biophysics of restriction endonucleases. The PI will create a summer workshop for high school students. In this workshop, students will learn concepts from single molecule biological physics and participate in a hands-on demonstration of DNA tethering. The PI will also create a professional development course for high school teachers. In this course, teachers will learn how to perform DNA tethering experiments they can do in their classrooms. Teachers will receive materials and supplies for the experiments and the PI will visit their classrooms for demonstrations and to speak with students about single molecule biological physics."
0.42,"The goal of this project is to develop quantitative understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of large populations with abundant selection and recombination by analyzing a variety of models that build in various of the key features. The interplay between multiple beneficial mutations accumulating in one lineage and recombination that breaks apart and brings together collections of such mutations will be studied in several situations: re-assortment, the exchange of chromosomes between individuals without recombination as occurs for influenza viruses; transfer of small segments of a genome as in lateral gene transfer between bacteria; occasional mating between otherwise asexually evolving populations, as in yeast; and various approximations of the spectrum of degrees of linkage that arise from the linear structure of chromosomes. Epistatic interactions between mutations together with changing linkage leads to a balance between selection on individual genes and selection on genomes: this will be explored for various models of the interactions focusing on the statistical properties of the rare, anomalously good combinations of mutations that dominate the future evolution. The models of epistasis will be informed by, and inform, experiments on laboratory evolution of budding yeast carried out by collaborators. Mating within or between asexually evolved populations that have been ""barcoded"", should provide crucial information about the fitness of parents and their offspring, and the theory developed will enable predictions about the benefits of sex that can be tested in future experiments. Going beyond well-mixed populations in which all individuals compete directly, other forms of competition that could be realized in the laboratory (such as selection of the best half of a population) will be studied. Spatial structure and the interplay between local competition and mixing on longer time scales will also be investigated, focusing on the effects of recombination on rates of evolution and dynamics of diversity. Collaborations with several groups carrying out laboratory evolution experiments with yeast or bacteria will be further developed to obtain statistical information needed for the modeling, and to propose and plan future experiments. Analysis of deep sequencing data of bacterial populations will be carried out with collaborators to infer aspects of the evolutionary history, including recombination, and to develop plans for the most informative future sampling and sequencing. The students and postdocs involved will greatly benefit from mentoring by several faculty from different fields. Beyond the research, the PI is developing new courses on evolution for quantitative scientists and biologists: lecture notes will be made available on the internet. The PI will also become further involved in educating the general public about evolution, including the future challenges, as well as the successes, of evolutionary theory."
0.534977,"This project involves the acquisition of a 4,300 core computer cluster to enable leading-edge research in solar physics, the solar wind and its properties, both fluid and plasma turbulence, magnetic reconnection and plasma instabilities, and magnetospheric physics. The cluster will be located in the University of New Hampshire Research Computation and Instrumentation (RCI) core facility and operated by its staff. The installation of the cluster will take advantage of the recent modernization and expansion of the RCI machine room, which provides a stable infrastructure and efficient power supply and cooling to minimize the carbon footprint. The cluster replaces an older one, Zaphod, which is now in its eighth year of operation. While Zaphod has enabled numerous studies and some breakthroughs in computational physics, the new cluster will be at least 15 times more powerful and thus enable more leading-edge science.<br/><br/>The cluster will significantly enhance our ability to simulate plasma and fluid systems, benefiting research projects with more than $3.5M in combined yearly expenditures. Progress will not be just incremental, but we have good reason to believe that in many cases our progress will open up new physical regimes. Most of the simulation codes that will be used are already mature, thus the impact of the cluster on scientific productivity will be immediate. Over its lifetime, the computer cluster will enable leading-edge research for at least a dozen faculty, and many more researchers, post-docs, graduate, and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Much of the research to be performed on the cluster is directly related to space weather. Our progress in modeling the solar corona, solar wind, and geospace has an immediate effect on the Nation's ability to forecast and nowcast space weather, and to understand and to mitigate its effects. The National Space Weather Program explicitly calls for the development of such capabilities. One of the projects supported addresses fundamental issues related to climate change, which is also a topic of great societal concern. The cluster will also make an impact on the education of students in all physical disciplines at UNH by giving them access to a state-of-the art computing facility. It will thus help us to attract the most qualified faculty, post-docs, and students, and it will be an extremely valuable resource for educating the next generation of computational scientists."
0.18,"Over 99% of the visible matter in the Universe is a plasma, that is a dilute gas of ions, electrons, and neutral particles. Despite their ubiquity, many fundamental and important physical processes which control the dynamics of plasmas remain poorly understood. In turn, this limits our ability to intepret diverse phenomena in space such as accretion onto black holes at the centers of galaxies or the interaction of the solar wind with the upper layers of the Earth?s atmosphere, and it also impacts our ability to engineer and operate experiments on Earth such as magnetically confined fusion devices. The Max-Panck/Princeton Center for Plasma Physics (MPPC) was established as a joint venture of the Max Planck Society (MPS) in Germany and Princeton University in order to forge new collaborations between Universities, the national plasma labs, and international partners in order to tackle some of the most pressing problems in plasma dynamics. The center fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between the plasma and astrophysics communities, as well as international collaboration between these communities in the US, Germany, and elsewhere. It serves to train the next generation of plasma scientists in experimental science, computation, and theory, and its international scope provides unique training for early career scientists, particularly valuable as plasma and fusion science become increasingly international. Finally, the center provides opportunities for the public, as well as students and teachers at public schools, local, and regional institutions to engage in scientific inquiry in ways that enhance their understanding of science concepts and scientific ways of thinking through a well established outreach program at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.<br/><br/>The MPPC focuses its effort studying four key topics: magnetic reconnection, acceleration and propagation of non-thermal particles, the properties of plasma turbulence, and magnetohydrodynamic processes in astrophysical plasmas such as the magneto-rotational instability. Uniquely, it leverages international expertise and resources such as experimental facilities and computational methods to lead new studies in theoretical, experimental, and computational plasma physics. The US program concentrates strongly on postdoctoral researchers, who work with senior researchers supported by existing funds. While the postdoc program is the engine that drives research in the center, there are a number of ways in which each participating organization has fused together as a center, for example (1) joint mentoring of postdocs, (2) exchange visits of senior members, (3) joint experiments, (4) joint code development and validation, (5) fostering collaborations across the entire US and German plasma and astrophysics communities, and (6) annual meetings of the center as a whole, and more frequent topical workshops for the community. For example, the MPPC will host a summer school in computational plasma physics at Princeton University within the current period of funding.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by NSF's Divisions of Physics and Astronomy (Mathematical & Physicsal Sciences Directorate), and the Office of International Science and Engineering."
0.1242,"Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the Universe and yet we do not know many of their properties. For example, we do not know their absolute mass scale or their particle-antiparticle nature. Because of their abundance, even a small mass could have far-reaching consequences for understanding their role in the evolution of our Universe. Knowing if neutrinos are their own antiparticles could have implications in understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry of our Universe. Neutrino-less double beta decay (NLDBD) experiments address these two fundamental questions. Double beta decay is a rare nuclear decay that has been measured in several nuclei when it is energetically favorable. Some nuclei are stable against ordinary beta decay but are unstable for double beta decay in which two neutrons in the nucleus are simultaneously converted to protons and two electrons are emitted. Double beta decay can proceed through several modes. The experimentally measured process, the two-neutrino mode in which two electron antineutrinos are also emitted, is completely described by known physics. NLDBD is an as-yet-undetected decay that involves no neutrinos in the final state and necessarily would indicate that neutrinos are their own antiparticle. The rate of such decays determines the scale for the effective neutrino mass. <br/><br/>CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is an experiment to search for NLDBD in the isotope 130-Te and is currently being built at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. CUORE is an array of TeO2 crystals used as cryogenic bolometers for the purpose of particle detection. The crystals act as both the source and the absorbing calorimetric material. These kinds of detectors offer good energy resolution and efficiencies and are well-suited for NLDBD searches. <br/><br/>This award will enable the PI to continue to provide opportunities for undergraduate students to participate on the CUORE experiment. This will involve tasks such as monitoring the gluing of thermistors and heaters on the 988 crystals, helping to assemble the calibration system and elements of the electronics and assisting with cryostat alignment, with tests of the various subsystems of the detector and with cryostat cool down or warm up diagnostics. This will give students invaluable experience working with a cutting-edge physics experiment in a world-class underground laboratory. <br/><br/>An exciting sector of public outreach that Cal Poly will pursue is to develop an interactive visualization scheme for CUORE physics. This software will serve as a channel for the public to gain insight into the scientific process and explore the mysteries of particle physics. Through Cal Poly's Center for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education they will help local teachers develop project-based-learning modules for high school physics courses that incorporate the underlying physics of CUORE."

0.015,"Researchers from University of Maryland, College Park, and University of California, Berkeley, plan to investigate atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) sources for modification of selected model biomolecules and to establish a scientific framework for development of atmospheric pressure plasma applications in biotechnology and plasma medicine (or biomedicine). Non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasmas are powerful sources for reactive chemical species that can have profound biological effects, but the sources are complex, poorly understood, and are difficult to design and control. Our knowledge of the nature of the plasma-biomaterial interaction using such atmospheric pressure plasma sources is especially inadequate. This work combines plasma source characterization/simulations, plasma-surface (tissue) treatments/in-situ surface characterization with biological assay methodologies, and various characterization approaches, including magnetic resonance characterization of solid state and solution macromolecules. The broader impacts of this project go beyond the establishment of baseline methodologies that can be used to characterize and control interactions of APP sources with biological targets. As an enabling technology, approaches and concepts unveiled in this work can be broadly applied in diverse applications where the biological environment must be well-controlled, e.g. disinfection of packaging for food and medicines, modification of biological systems, cells and tissue, including the field of plasma medicine. The principles under study in this project are also relevant to all applications of APP for surface functionalization of organic materials such as polymers.<br/><br/>The project's first objective is to obtain a fundamental understanding of how fluxes of reactive species produced in two representative APP devices depend on source type, operating parameters and environmental conditions using relevant chemistries. The second objective is to expose selected biomolecules to well controlled species from these APP sources to induce atomistic modifications of the biomolecules. The changes in biomolecule properties (chemical, morphological etc) along with alterations in biological function will be characterized using an array of complementary methods. Furthermore, modifications in biological function will be correlated with the results of the comprehensive materials/surface characterizations to provide underlying chemical and biological mechanisms. The third objective is to obtain a scientific understanding of how water modulates APP-biomolecule interactions to affect its biological function. This includes establishment of differences in APP species fluxes, chemical/morphological changes in biomolecules, and their biological responses to bio-assays when water is present either in the gas stream passing through the APP source, the environment (humidity) or as a liquid on the surface of the biomolecule. The fourth objective is experimental validation of current computational efforts on simulating atomic-scale modifications of specific model biomolecules by reactive species produced by APP sources. This will be based on investigating biomolecules for which atomic-scale simulations of the interaction of reactive plasma species with these biomolecules have either been published, or are currently ongoing."

Ditmire (University of Texas) and T. Donnelly (Harvey Mudd College)<br/><br/>Scientific Merit<br/><br/>This grant supports a collaboration between Prof. Ditmire at the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and Prof. Donnelly at Harvey Mudd College (HMC), an undergraduate institution. We will investigate mechanisms by which high-intensity laser pulses deposit energy into matter. While the nature of intense laser interactions with atoms, molecules, and solids has been studied for many years, exactly how intense laser pulses interact with objects that are of a spatial scale comparable to the light's wavelength (less than a millionth of a meter) is largely unexplored. We will focus a 20 TW laser - a laser with nearly ten times the power of that on the entire US electrical grid - onto wavelength-scale targets and study the resulting electron and ions energies to study the mechanisms by which laser energy is absorbed by the target. The scientific merit of this work rests in filling this gap in our knowledge of physics, and in developing improved x-ray and neutron sources. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The broader scientific impacts of this research rest in advancing the understanding of high-intensity laser interactions with a class of targets not previously well explored. Application of these studies may aid in the development of improved x-ray sources for radiography and time-resolved diffraction, or compact neutron sources for imaging other systems. The broader educational impact of this work is found in the training that both graduate and undergraduate students will receive. Our work represents a unique collaboration in which an undergraduate group is directly and critically involved in strong-field-physics research, a field which is prohibitively resource intensive for an undergraduate research program to pursue alone. The undergraduates funded by this grant will have the opportunity to do research at HMC, travel to UT in the summers to participate in research using equipment they have developed, and travel to conferences to present their work to the scientific community. Our collaboration will continue to be an effective way to motivate undergraduates to seek advanced degrees in science."
0.225,"There is a wide range of beneficial and practical applications of accelerators and particle physics including medical diagnostic instrumentation, cancer therapy, monitoring of nuclear waste proliferation, computing, and many more. Optimizing an accelerator's operational parameters is a complex problem, yet critical to achieve robust performance and to increase the number of circulating particles. Computer models will be developed in this project to investigate the possible configurations, set specifications, and estimate the system performance. Algorithms will also be created to operate the accelerator as efficiently as possible, thus increasing the discovery potential in accelerator experiments. Student participation is an integral part of this project. The students will benefit from participating in cutting-edge research and having access to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. They will develop scientific programming and modeling skills, learn how to create and validate simulations, conduct measurements, and be involved with operations of complex accelerator systems. All of these experiences will be a realistic introduction to graduate work, and/or work in advanced industry in one of the many areas in which accelerators play a key role.<br/><br/>Innovative developments in a broad range of subfields of accelerator physics and technology will be required to achieve the beam specifications for the next generation accelerators. There are two major objectives in this project. First, a general model of the interaction between the next generation radio frequency (RF) system and the particle beam dynamics will be generated, which can be applied to future particle colliders and light sources. Second, this general model will be validated through application to a particular particle accelerator. The simulations of the next generation RF and low level radio frequency (LLRF) systems will be developed as block systems in the computer program Simulink. The simulation defining parameters and the initial conditions will be set in Matlab. Multi-particle simulations will also be developed in Python. The validation of models developed during this project will be done using the Large Hadron Collider crab cavity system, located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. The validation process will involve conducting proof of principle simulations, investigating the LLRF-beam dynamics interaction, studying the LLRF implementation, examining detrimental effects, and developing control algorithms; thus expanding the deliverables of this project. This project will have a significant impact on advancing knowledge in accelerator physics. The knowledge and expertise developed will be directly applicable to future particle colliders and light sources."

Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays. VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. This award supports scientists at California Polytech State University to carry out research with VERITAS. The group will work on improved gamma-ray detection algorithms for VERITAS and use the improved sensitivity to study acceleration mechanisms in active galaxies and to search for dark matter. Undergraduates will be involved in the research. The group will work with the Center for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education to communicate the physics of black holes and high energy gamma-ray emission to students. They will also work with teachers in the Student Teacher and Research program and develop teaching supplements that can be used in middle school curricula.<br/><br/>VERITAS has embarked upon a broad program of Galactic and extragalactic source observations, as well as studies of signatures for new physics such as dark matter.

0.035,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Matthew Mewes at California Polytechnic State University.<br/><br/>Lorentz invariance is the basis of Special Relativity and is thought to be an exact symmetry of nature. It is a feature of both the Standard Model of particle physics and General Relativity. Consequently, any violation of this basic principle would be a signal of new physics. Moreover, attempts to unify the Standard Model and General Relativity suggest Lorentz invariance might be slightly broken at low energies. The research of Professor Mewes focuses on the theoretical description of Lorentz-symmetry breaking and the identification of possible experimental signatures. The goal of this project is to extend existing theory to include a very broad class of Lorentz-invariance violations. To date, most studies of Lorentz violation have focused on the simplest minimal violations. This project aims to understand the theoretical and experimental significance of more general nonminimal violations. Research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. Moreover, parts of this work will be accessible to undergraduates and will provide research opportunities for physics majors at Cal Poly, a primarily undergraduate institution. Students involved in this research will gain valuable exposure to theoretical physics.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, this project seeks to fill in several major gaps in the theoretical framework known as the Standard-Model-Extension (SME). The SME aims to provide a general description of Lorentz violation in any system. The generality of the approach implies that the full SME contains an infinite number of violations. To keep the problem tractable, most studies have focused on the minimal SME, which restricts attention to operators of renormalizable mass dimension. However, there are reasons to suspect that nonrenormalizable violations may dominate. Recent studies have systematically examined nonrenormalizable violations in photons and free fermions. This project will build on this work by studying violations in gauge interactions between photons and fermions. It will also extend our understanding of potential violations in gravity by considering higher-order nonminimal violations in General Relativity."
0.196017,"Active galaxies (AGN) harbor a super-massive black hole at their core surrounded by an accretion disk. Little is known about the interaction between the accretion disk and the black hole, an interaction that produces powerful beamed jets of highly-energetic particles and radiation. The spectrum of this radiation is a strong indicator of the acceleration mechanisms involved. VERITAS, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, located in Southern Arizona at the Whipple Observatory Base camp, is an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes designed to detect very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (100 GeV - 50 TeV) that shower in the earth's atmosphere. <br/><br/>While the direct-detection of dark matter has not yet been achieved, indirect detection efforts involve searching for VHE gamma-rays. Dwarf galaxies and globular clusters are believed to be good candidates for dark matter because the virial velocities of the star populations within them exceed what is expected from the luminous matter and in fact give an indirect measure of the dark matter present. They are ideal for VHE gamma-ray searches because they are nearby and have no known VHE emitters within their cores. <br/><br/>This award will bring astrophysics experiences to Cal Poly. The goals of the proposed analysis effort are to improve the VERITAS gamma-ray detection algorithms and to use the improved sensitivity to study the acceleration mechanisms in AGN and to search for dark matter.<br/><br/>This RUI grant will bring year-round research opportunities to two students. Undergraduate students will be given broad exposure to the science while working on a focused and tractable research project suitable for a senior thesis. Cal Poly is also one of the leading producers of high-school physics teachers in the state.

0.015,"Last year, antihydrogen was trapped for the first time by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN. By this point hundreds of antiatoms have been trapped for times as long as 1000 s. While this was a remarkable achievement, the ALPHA apparatus is not well configured for most measurements of the properties of antihydrogen, and must be rebuilt to allow laser and better microwave access. Furthermore, the trapping rates, while sufficient to begin studies of the properties of antimatter, are lower than optimal. There are two broad challenges to improving the trapping rate: (1) Understanding the behavior of the positron and antiproton plasmas from which the antihydrogen is synthesized; and (2) Understanding the atomic processes by which positrons and antiprotons recombine. Antihydrogen synthesis lies on the boundary between atomic and plasma physics, and cannot be studied properly without employing tools from both fields. The long term goal of antihydrogen research is to search for differences between the properties of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences might occur between the spectra of the two species. Differences in the spectra could only result from CPT violation. Another place differences might occur is in the gravitational interactions of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences could solve the baryogenesis problem. A third area of potential difference is in the fractional charge of antihydrogen. The net charge of antihydrogen is only known to about 10^-7 relative to the unit charge. Positive results from any of these measurements would completely change our understanding of fundamental particles and fields. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and 3D PIC codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics. <br/><br/>The long-¬term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us.

The trapping of antihydrogen last year was extraordinarily widely noted in the lay and scientific press. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimentalists learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, UHV practice, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theorists can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program.

Turbulent mixing of ionized gas, called plasma, is especially fascinating when the plasma is embedded inside a strong magnetic force field. Mixing of magnetized plasma has special geometric relationships, couples energy from small and large sized vortex-like structures know as ""eddies,"" and creates self-organization through a remarkable turbulent ""pinch."" A collaboration between two universities will operate two unique facilities, called laboratory magnetospheres, that contain high-temperature ionized gas using a magnetic force field that resembles the field that surround our Earth and other planets. New measurements will be combined with new theories and simulations that will answer unresolved questions including: How do plasma eddies couple energy at different sizes? How do plasmas evolve during turbulent mixing? What mechanisms cause turbulent self-organization? New science will advance including: (1) global imaging and control of turbulent interchange mixing in a variety of plasma conditions, (2) study of electrostatic self-organization through the understanding of the turbulent pinch, and (3) validating our models for lowfrequency turbulence by carrying out self-consistent nonlinear simulations of turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres.<br/><br/>This research has broad impact because turbulent mixing of magnetized plasma is ubiquitous and fundamental. Understanding turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres will improve our understanding of (1) processes occurring in the ionosphere, which is important to satellite communication, (2) turbulence inside the central regions of planetary magnetospheres, which is important to space weather models, and (3) the anisotropic mixing of low-dimensional fluid systems, which is important to industrial processes. Additionally, this collaborative research uses state-of-the-art facilities at highly-regarded research universities to motivate students and scientists to explore plasma dynamics in a magnetic configuration that resembles a magnetosphere and to encourage the next generation of scientists able to understand and control high-temperature, ionized matter."

0.015,"This project will investigate the physical properties of a near-surface layer of a plasma, a plasma sheath, which forms when a solid body is placed into a plasma. Plasmas are gases consisting of free ions and electrons; they are abundant in the universe, have many industrial applications and are the critical component of controlled fusion research. Nearly a half of the manufacturing steps necessary to fabricate a computer microprocessor employ plasmas. The interaction of plasmas with materials depends on the region close to the surfaces known as the plasma sheath. Better understanding of sheaths will lead to improved microprocessor fabrications and might be essential in achieving controlled fusion. The tabletop experiments employed in this study are also ideal for, and will greatly contribute to, training of students in the field of plasma physics and other STEM fields. <br/><br/>Proposed new and continuing experiments are aimed at establishing the basic properties of sheaths and associated presheaths, which accelerate ions to the sheath. The specific questions that will be addressed are: 1. What are the details of the newly recognized instability-enhanced collisional friction? 2. What happens to the anisotropy of ion velocity distribution functions (IVDFs) along the presheath and at the sheath-edge? 3. Why do experimental transverse IVDF results differ from simulations? 4. Are the ions in three species weakly collisional plasmas all lost at the system sound velocity when they have comparable densities? 5. Are there separate presheaths associated with ion-neutral collisions and oblique magnetic fields? 6. How do sheaths and presheaths at dielectric and mixed boundaries differ from those at conductors? 7. Does the sheath disappear or not when a small electrode is biased to the plasma potential? Coordinated studies of these phenomena will be carried out at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of San Diego. Experiments will determine the presheath and sheath plasma potential profiles and the resulting IVDFs associated with ion acceleration. Most of the experiments will be carried out in Madison and led by the PI Prof. Noah Hershkowitz. Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) diagnostic development will be carried out on both campuses and led by the Co-PI Prof. Greg Severn. Plasma parameters will be determined with two or more techniques, e.g. combinations of emissive probes, LIF, Langmuir probes, ion acoustic wave measurements, and optical emission spectroscopy. Experiments will employ hot filament multi-dipole, capacitive, inductive, and helicon sources currently in operation."
1.5,"This award renews operation of the Basic Plasma Science Facility (BaPSF) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and supports the vigorous research program of the BaPSF scientific staff, as well as continuing the improvements in scientific instrumentation required to maintain worldwide leadership in fundamental plasma research. BaPSF provides national and international scientists access to unique research devices and diagnostic tools that permit the exploration of a wide range of fundamental plasma problems that impact topics at the frontiers of fusion, space science and plasma technology. The broad parameter ranges accessible in the plasma devices operated at BaPSF allow studies that span microscopic phenomena on the fast electron time scales (e.g., electron plasma waves, cyclotron radiation) to the slow time scales characteristic of plasma transport driven by drift-wave turbulence and long wavelength magnetic fluctuations.<br/><br/>Qualified researchers and research teams from universities, national laboratories and industry can perform experiments at BaPSF, free of charge, upon approval of their proposals by the BaPSF Scientific Council composed of senior scientists broadly representative of the plasma community. The BaPSF plasma devices provide effective platforms for the training of graduate students because of their optimum, mid-scale size. They also provide a fertile environment for the development of young professors by allowing them to focus entirely on scientific research without the burden of hardware maintenance and construction. BaPSF also operates a small, dedicated plasma device to train high school teachers and students enrolled in the outreach LAPTAG program.<br/><br/>The BaPSF allows the detailed study, under controlled conditions, of fundamental questions in plasma science that cannot be addressed in any other laboratory. The results obtained impact a wide range of frontier topics in fusion and space plasma research. It also lays the foundation for future developments in plasma technology. Through creative development of plasma sources and the operation of complementary plasma devices exploited through focused campaigns, the operation of BaPSF constitutes a transformative concept within plasma science.<br/><br/>One of the broader impacts of the BaPSF is that it provides unique opportunities in the training of young researchers from both large and small institutions, as well as high school students and teachers. BaPSF fosters and engenders collaborations between domestic and international institutions and scientists from diverse areas, such as fusion, space and industrial applications. The topical campaigns made possible by BaPSF provides a forum for the interaction of experimentalists, theoreticians and modelers from varied backgrounds, promoting the cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques."
0.512269,"In this CAREER project the PI will study pre-clustering of the IgE receptor system. The proposed approach is to use the intermittent and independent fluctuations of fluorescent probes that are either photo-switchable or naturally intermittent to extract individual trajectories even when there are clusters of fluorophores with sizes below the diffraction limit. The approach is based on finding parameters and states in hidden Markov models and this approach will be further developed. The specific aims of this project are (1) to use fluorescent probes that are either photo-switchable or naturally intermittent to find single membrane protein trajectories of high density membrane components; (2) to use the trajectories of closely spaced proteins in conjunction with physical models to extract the binding kinetics between single molecules and to map out the energy landscape of the cell membrane; (3) using the developed techniques, to characterize the behavior of the IgE binding receptor of RBL-2H3 cells. The project will provide multidisciplinary training for a graduate student as well as undergraduate students and offer annual, paid research mentorships to high school students in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area. A student exchange program with the Quantitative Imaging group at Delft Technical University, Netherlands will allow up to 3 months annual international study for graduate students or promising undergraduates. An upper level Biophysics course will be developed based on the research interests of the PI's department. Speakers will be invited from within the U.S. to give talks on related research in a biophysics seminar series."
0.409663,"A complex (dusty) plasma is a four-component plasma system consisting of ions, electrons, neutral particles and charged microparticles. The microparticle component interacts with the other plasma components, acquires a net charge and self-consistently modifies the surrounding plasma medium. The resulting system is notably more complex than the traditional plasma, supporting a wide range of physical phenomena and having connections to nanoscience, fluid mechanics and material science. As a result, this field has, over the past twenty years, rapidly evolved into a scientifically interesting and technically challenging subfield of plasma physics. The objective of this research is to make detailed measurements of the distribution of thermal energy and the evolutions of the thermal and transport properties of a dusty plasma to address a number of open questions in the field of dusty plasmas. This will be accomplished through the use of the next generation particle image velocimetry (PIV) diagnostic, tomographic PIV, and high-speed imaging techniques.<br/><br/>The results of this project will provide new and fundamental insight into the thermal and transport properties of the dusty plasma system at the kinetic level. In particular, this project will provide detailed measurements of the distribution of the dust thermal energy, how this energy is redistributed within the dusty plasma system and will contribute to the development of an equation of state for these systems. This project will provide new insight into the three-dimensional morphological features of these systems, such as the structure of the dust acoustic wave, and address open phenomenological questions involving the strength of the neutral drag force. Further, this project will serve as a springboard to involve undergraduates at small, liberal arts undergraduate institution in cutting-edge plasma science research through direct involvement in ongoing research efforts, through student attendance at regional and national professional meetings and through the development of level-appropriate curricular material at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum."
0.45,"Plasma acceleration is a cutting-edge technique for accelerating charged particles such as electrons using the electric field associated with a plasma structure, such as an electron plasma wave. The plasma structure is created using either ultra-short laser pulses or particle beams. This technique offers a way to build high performance particle accelerators of much smaller size than conventional accelerator techniques. The goal of this award is visualizing evolving plasma wakefield accelerator structures generated by intense GeV electron bunches. The single-shot visualization and control techniques developed and refined through this research can impact a wide cross section of plasma science. The visualization of electron beam driven wakes will support development of ""plasma afterburners"", an emerging technology for doubling the energy of conventional linear colliders. These methods will also promote more reliable tabletop plasma-based accelerators, which are useful as compact coherent x-ray sources for biological, chemical, and medical research, injectors for conventional accelerators, and medical accelerators. Finally the proposed research will train a research associate, a Ph.D. student, and an undergraduate from UT-San Antonio, which ranks 4th in the nation in number of undergraduate degrees awarded to Hispanics.<br/><br/>The proposed award will provide the first direct laboratory visualization of electron-beam driven plasma wakes, and will advance new, unique approaches to visualizing rapidly evolving relativistic electron-beam-plasma interactions that the PI pioneered. They will complement, benchmark and validate computer simulations in understanding the physics of electron-beam driven wakes, and in developing strategies to optimize and scale plasma wakefield accelerators."
0.675721,"Light sources are accelerators that circulate electrons around a storage ring, producing very intense beams of photons in a range of useful wavelengths. Photons are produced by synchrotron radiation, which is generated when electrons experience acceleration due to a change in the direction of their trajectory. By shining these photons on a sample to be studied, basic properties of these sample materials can be inferred. Using radiation of different wavelength (e.g, X-rays or ultraviolet) can help elucidate material properties at different distance scales in the samples being studied. Light sources have many applications, including in biology, physics, materials science, and national security. <br/><br/>This proposal aims to develop a new technique to quickly change the direction, or undulate, electrons in a light source. Typically light sources use static magnets that undulate electron beams to generate radiation. However, with current technology it is difficult to obtain short undulator periods needed for shorter radiation wavelengths and reduced electron beam energy operation without compromising the overall beam quality. To overcome these limitations, the PI will develop a novel short-period electromagnetic undulator operating at millimeter-wave with a period of less than 1 millimeter (mm). The scaling laws for this type of undulator predict an aperture, typically, three times the undulator period. This represents a paradigm shift for the design and implementation of undulators for light sources. Because the surface field is very low at the walls of the Radio-Frequency (RF) undulator, the field at the center of the undulator is predicted to be much higher than anything possible with a static magnetic undulator. The design goal is to have an approximately 5 Tesla field for an undulator that has less than 1 mm period. This device will have the added benefit of fast dynamic strength and polarization control of the produced light.<br/><br/>This award will support the training of PhD students and post-doctoral scholars at Stanford University, engaging them in advanced RF/microwave design algorithms and simulation tools. This project has the potential to have a profound impact on many beam-based light sources. Dreams of compact economical free electron lasers, which can be installed at many universities and research institutions, will become closer to reality as RF undulators become a common tool. This applies also to light sources developed for a variety of medical and industrial applications as well as applications related to national security."
0.18,"'Beaming' energy (i.e. matter) and information (i.e. data) in a most efficient way has inspired science and science fiction equally. In 1960s, lasers were invented allowing us to beam energy and information via light beams having its internal constituents almost perfectly ordered and working as a team. Lasers are intrinsically 'cool', made possible by clever tricks invented by atomic scientists and engineers. To date this feat has not been achieved by beams of charged particles such as electrons which are produced in a very hot, restless state by the mechanisms used to extract them from materials. The electrons embedded in most materials have to overcome a tremendous barrier and climb up and beyond an energy hill which they remember and which they vent off literally by being very unruly, restless and jittery upon their release. A typical electron beam produced in today's laboratories is very hot indeed, comparable to the surface of the sun. This research will develop special and precisely patterned structured materials with features a thousand times smaller than the width of human hair (e.g. carbon nanotube- or Graphene-based structures), immersed in a very high electric field allowing the electrons inside the material to 'tunnel through' the barrier hills effortlessly without climbing them, thus making the released electrons colder and ordered, traveling together in a single file so-to-speak, as a beam of electrons that is so 'cold' that it will act like a particle laser beam. Complex theoretical and computational modeling of 'designer' emitters will go hand-in-hand with state-of-the-art fabrication of such delicate and precise structures and their subsequent testing for performance in the laboratory. Once produced, special effort will have to be made to allow the electrons to remain cold while gaining speed and energy as a beam.<br/><br/>The particular research and development will depend on a collaboration of Northern Illinois University (NIU) with major national and international laboratories and their facilities such as the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Cambridge Graphene Centre (CGC) and US industries. Specially designed samples will be prepared in collaboration with ANL and CGC facilities and will be tested at NIU/FNAL specially designed test facility. The research will open up new areas of scientific investigation and their societal/industrial applications e.g. compact x-ray lasers for 'ultra-fast' science, novel computational possibilities based upon a single quantum of charge and 'spin', three dimensional rapid electron-beam printing of complex unique structures of industrial and medical interest, compact portable sources of light for lithography of novel nano-structures for the electronic chip industry. The activity will inspire inclusive collaboration between scientists, engineers and technologists in research and education and integrate academia, national laboratory and industry for knowledge-based economic wealth creation, integrating the local and national education and outreach programs at NIU inclusive of diversity, minority education and training goals."
0.557689,"Accelerators are important instruments for the advancement of scientific research, for their broad application in medicine and industry, and as a research area in their own right. Accelerators typically accelerate protons, antiprotons, electrons and positrons (anti-electrons). Powerful accelerators have lead to the discoveries of the Higgs Boson and the top quark, intermediate sized accelerators have been used as sources of x-rays to study properties of materials, and smaller machines are used to provide cancer therapy or for electron beam microscopy. <br/><br/>A recent novel trend in accelerator and beam physics is the development of precise electron beams for diverse applications in the study of ultrafast structural dynamics, and as the drivers for Free Electron Lasers or laser-based accelerators. This award to UCLA aims to develop a new electron source capable of generating electron beams with an order of magnitude higher brightness than has been previously achievable using state-of-the-art radiofrequency photoinjectors. By pushing for lower beam charges, the design choices of a photoinjector cavity can be reevaluated, incorporating recent advances in cathode surface engineering and adopting different solutions for the beam dynamics. <br/><br/>Technically, the development of a novel electron source with extreme beam parameters will have important impact on compact x-ray free-electron lasers and ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy.

Educationally, the work with be intrinsically interdisciplinary and will provide full hands-on experience for students with a broad preparation in photoemission physics, laser and accelerator technology, and high brightness beam and beam diagnostic development.<br/><br/>In the program as awarded, the UCLA group plans to study some of the most pressing unanswered questions in electron-source physics, such as the growth of the longitudinal emittance and uncorrelated energy spread and the limit in the cathode thermal emittance."
0.104999,"The progress of basic research into physics, biomedicine, materials science, and chemistry depends critically on the qualities of high-energy electrons. An important current application of electrons is x-ray radiology, used for medical diagnostics, homeland security, non-destructive analysis, and computer manufacturing. By developing novel methods to accelerate electrons with laser light, this project aims to demonstrate new techniques to greatly improve the quality of electron beams. In the process, a new generation of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will receive training in disciplines deemed essential for national scientific and economic competitiveness. <br/><br/>The development of compact high-field-gradient laser-plasma accelerators has advanced rapidly in recent years. Several recent theoretical studies predict the possibility of ultra-low emittance beams (substantially lower than the current state of the art). However, these predictions have yet to be tested experimentally. Such experiments will be conducted during this project with the cutting-edge laser technology, including the petawatt peak-power-level DIOCLES laser, available at the University of Nebraska's Extreme Light laboratory. Laser light will be used to both inject and accelerate electrons, producing beams with record low emittance. Novel methods will be developed and implemented to measure ultra-low beam emittance. The experimental results will be compared with predictions of modeling and simulation?to either validate existing physical models, or develop new ones that agree with observations. It is anticipated that this research will significantly improve our understanding of the fundamental physics of laser-wakefield electron accelerators, as well as further advance their development."
0.125,"Our capabilities to capture images of atoms and molecules in motion have been revolutionized by X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) driven by large-scale radio-frequency accelerators. Plasma acceleration is a cutting-edge technique that accelerates electrons more than a thousand times faster than these conventional accelerators. In particular, laser-plasma accelerators are leading the way toward self-contained compact accelerators and light sources. This award will investigate a novel way to produce extreme ultraviolet and X-ray free-electron lasers based on laser-plasma accelerators. The advancement will be used to develop practical applications of laser-plasma accelerators in compact and coherent radiation sources. The award will also support the training of graduate students at Stanford University, engaging them in the development of advanced beam and free-electron lasers theory and simulation tools. <br/><br/>Laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) have shown the abilities to accelerate electron beams from rest up to a few GeV using high-intensity lasers interacting in centimeter-scale plasmas. Although the beams have relatively low emittance and high peak current with only a few femtosecond pulse duration, the beam energy spread is two orders of magnitude larger than the spread from conventional radio-frequency accelerators. Such a large energy spread can make the FEL interaction in a normal undulator very ineffective. A transverse gradient undulator (TGU) can be used to compensate the effects of beam energy spread if the electron energy is correlated with its transverse position in the TGU. Previous theoretical and numerical studies have shown that such a concept may drastically improve the LPA FEL performance. This award will take the concept to practice by studying beam transport and dynamics from a LPA to and inside a TGU with the desired optics properties, and by developing FEL simulation tools that take into account various effects in a TGU. For verification of results, comparisons will be made, where applicable, to TGU experiments through external collaborations."
0.449221,"Overview<br/>This project focuses on the understanding of the plasma physics of Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion sources and the complex beam transport involved in the extraction of particles from ECR ion source plasmas. ECR is a phenomenon observed in plasma physics, condensed matter physics and accelerator physics. The cyclotron is an electron particle accelerator that uses an oscillating electric field tuned to a resonance frequency of the electrons moving in a magnetic field. This resonance adds kinetic energy to the electron. <br/><br/>ECR ion source development is a cross disciplinary research field that combines plasma physics, atomic physics, accelerator physics, magnet technology, and accelerator engineering. ECR ion sources are superior injectors for heavy ion facilities because of their versatility and reliability. Higher charge state ions allow making accelerators more compact and cost effective, which has been a major motivator for ECR ion source research. To fulfill the intensity requirements of future heavy ion facilities, the technology needs to be extended to the next level. Based on previous experience, the next technology leap will be a demanding research and development intensive task. To take advantage of the higher plasma density, new ion beam extraction systems must be developed which allow one to extract high quality ion beams from the high magnetic field. This award addresses some of the fundamental physics questions and technical challenges that need to be answered to facilitate this technology leap.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This award will extend the understanding of the plasma physics of ECR ion sources and the complex beam transport of beams extracted from ECR ion source plasmas. The experimentally measured plasma properties will be combined with ion beam transport experiments to develop a realistic model of the extracted multispecies ion beam. The research will advance beam transport simulation tools by modeling the interaction of the beam with the residual gas in the beam line. This will allow the design and optimization of the beam transport line for ECR ion source injectors.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>ECR ion sources are state-of-the-art injector systems for heavy ion accelerators, carbon therapy accelerators and industrial applications. Thus the expertise gained through this award will be not only of academic interest, but will contribute to the development of a highly sought-after workforce for research facilities and industry alike through the training of undergraduate and graduate students in this field. The ECR ion sources at Michigan State University provide an ideal, hands-on educational experience for students and postdocs and will provide an opportunity to develop advanced simulation tools."

This technique offers a way to build high performance particle accelerators of much smaller size than conventional accelerator techniques. <br/><br/>This award will further develop Laser-Plasma accelerators (LPA). Applications of LPA electron beams require capture, transport, and manipulation of the electron beam following exit of the plasma accelerator. This award will investigate two aspects of beam dynamics following the plasma accelerator that are critical to future applications:<br/> 1. Coupling of the LPA beam into conventional beam transport systems.<br/> 2. Beam decompression to enable light source applications.<br/><br/>This work will benefit most applications of LPA beams, in particular for high energy physics and light source applications. The production of high-energy particle beams for particle physics applications requires the staging of multiple LPAs, and the proposed research will directly impact the design of the LPA beam coupling system between stages. An LPA driven Free Electron Laser (FEL) is considered one of the most promising near-term applications of LPA technology, and this research will lay the groundwork for the first proof-of-principle demonstration of an LPA-driven FEL generating coherent, high-peak brightness x-rays.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this award lies in the development of practical LPA applications such as future high-energy physics beams for exploration of new physics. This will be done by exploring solutions to the two issues mentioned above. First, the use of tailored plasma profiles will be investigated to reduce the beam divergence, enabling improved coupling to a conventional beam transport system. Second, by exploring Free-Electron lasers (FEL). LPAs deliver high peak current beams, and, hence, it is natural to consider LPA beams as drivers for FELs. Although the FEL application is presently hindered by the energy spread (few percent) of the LPA electron beam, application of LPA beams to FELs may be accomplished using experimentally-demonstrated LPA beam properties by beam phase space manipulation following the LPA. This project considers decompression of the femtosecond LPA beam, reducing the beam slice energy spread, enabling FEL lasing."
0.33,"This experimental research program will make precision measurements of quantum scattering phase shifts of ultracold cesium (Cs) atoms in an atomic clock. The group has demonstrated these measurements with a new type of scattering experiment that scatters a cesium atom in a coherent superposition of its two clock states off atoms in a pure state at ultracold temperatures. Each clock state experiences an s-wave scattering phase shift and, by detecting only the scattered part of each atom's wavefunction, the difference of the scattering phase shifts is directly observed as a phase shift of Ramsey fringes. A unique feature is that the observed difference of the scattering phase shifts is independent of the atomic density, providing atomic clock accuracy to scattering measurements. With high precision, the group has observed a number of Feshbach resonances with two clouds colliding at energies between 10 and 50 microKelvin, and recently at collision energies of order 1 microKelvin, within a single cloud. They will perform a first accuracy demonstration, which is expected to significantly improve the knowledge of the Cs-Cs interactions. The scattering lengths are presently insufficiently known that they impact the accuracy and operational parameters of cesium clocks, particularly the Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES) clock scheduled to fly on the International Space Station. The group will evaluate systematic errors, principally due to backgrounds, and improve the precision of the phase measurements. An improved theoretical understanding can guide future measurements, potentially studying different angular momenta, versus energy and magnetic field, and for various internal states. The group will also collaborate with national labs around the world to improve the accuracy of the best atomic clocks. The group provides a unique expertise on the design of microwave cavities for primary atomic clocks and participates in the accuracy evaluation of primary atomic clocks. Ideas developed as part of the juggling experimental work provided the explanation of the interactions of ultracold fermions for optical lattice clocks, recently experimentally observed in a chip-scale atomic clock and with a radio frequency transition in Li-6 fermions. <br/><br/>Accurate time keeping is crucial for navigation, communication, global positioning, and national security. Recent research of this group has significantly advanced the accuracy of the atomic clocks that contribute to International Atomic Time (TAI). Their contributions were essential to realize the currently most accurate atomic clock. Novel advancements by the research have reduced many large systematic errors that previously limited the performance of atomic clocks. Earlier work had led to rubidium being adopted as the first amendment to the definition of the International System of Units (SI) second, novel space clock designs, and an understanding of the frequency shifts due to ultracold collisions in precision measurements. The research will further advance the most accurate precision measurements and the understanding of ultracold atom-atom interactions. The training of graduate and undergraudate students in many areas of modern technology from lasers, electro-optics, radio-frequency and microwave techniques, and atomic clocks and frequency control, is important for the development of the nation's scientific workforce."
0.09,"The electroweak standard model describes two of the four fundamental forces present in the universe. By conducting experiments that probe with increasing sensitivity phenomena that can be described with this model, it is hoped discrepancies will appear that will lead to a more complete understanding of the weak interaction which is responsible for the decay, or transformation, of the neutron into a proton, electron and antineutrino. Among the measurements that can be made involving neutron decay are correlations between the properties of the neutron and its decay products. One of these correlations, known as little ""a"", involves the direction of emission of the electron and antineutrino from the decay region. Other neutron decay correlations are known to within 1%, but little ""a"" is only known to 4%. After several years of planning and construction, the aCORN (""a"" CORrelation in Neutron decay) collaboration is in the process of collecting data on the fundamental physics beamline at the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR).

0.189532,"The goal of this project is to develop a versatile device that probes quantum properties of small diatomic molecular ions (particles composed of two atoms that have lost one or more electrons). The singly charged hydrogen molecular ion (two protons, bound together by a single electron) is a simple but fundamental example of such an ion. Diatomic molecular ions are important because they are abundantly found in space, and might also briefly exist in other settings, including living organisms. The mechanism binding the two atoms is very similar to a coiled spring, allowing the atoms to move one with respect to the other without going astray. According to the basics of Quantum Mechanics, a diatomic molecular ion is continually vibrating in a range of discrete quantum states at different temperatures, which are defined by integers that state the degree of vibration on a given scale for which the bigger the integer, the stronger the pulsation. The proposed device probes these discrete states and is comparable to a thermometer reading a low temperature for a cold object and high temperature for hot one. It will also provide data that will help to understand how the vibrational states affect their environment during interaction with other particles. Not well understood, these slow interactions, technically called low energy interactions, are known to play important roles in the interstellar medium, in the cold part of nuclear fusion plasmas, and in the processes of DNA strand breaks, etc. Thus, this project will promote the progress of science and may have implications to a broad spectrum of areas of importance to society; at the same time, it will give participating undergraduate students the opportunity to take part in the development of a sophisticated 3-D imaging device at their own institution.<br/><br/>The charge transfer in collisions between hydrogen and diatomic molecular ions touches a variety of disciplines spreading from physical science to life science. First of all, it is of foremost importance in fundamental physics because it involves the smallest atom. It is also one of the dominant reactions in environments such as the cold divertor plasma regions of a fusion tokamak or in interstellar clouds where the main constituents are neutral H, the positive hydrogen ion, and H-molecules. Moreover, understanding of this simplest fundamental system is a key for mastering more complex systems which exist in, e.g., biophysics where radical attacks on biomolecules such as DNA potentially involve charge transfer at very low energy. However, it is often almost impossible to compare laboratory measured cross sections to existing theories and calculations because the vibrational state distribution of the molecules is not known. The proposed 3-D imaging device will ultimately improve previously measured absolute cross section measurements by making them vibrationally resolved, enabling a more detailed comparison between theoretical and experimental results. In this 3-D imaging technique, the molecular ion undergoes a resonant dissociative charge exchange with an alkali atom and releases its vibrational energy in the form of kinetic energy of the two fragments. The detection of the positions of the daughter particles and their flight time differences made possible with the detectors allows the reconstruction of the molecular ion's initial vibrational energy via simple dynamics. This detection technique is equivalent to taking a time resolved snapshot picture of the molecular ion fragments (thus the name 3-D imaging). The whole 3-D imaging apparatus is envisioned to be a portable device which could be easily transported to and used at a variety of research facilities."
0.792241,"One of the most important questions regarding neutrino properties is whether or not neutrinos are their own antiparticles, or equivalently, whether neutrinos are Majorana rather than Dirac particles. If neutrinos are Majorana particles, the mechanism that gives them mass is not part of the Standard Model of particle physics and requires new physics. The most practical way to observe that neutrinos are Majorana particles is to see the neutrino-less double beta decay, a process that explicitly violates the conservation of lepton number. The work supported by this award will develop new techniques for increasing the concentration of metals that can be loaded into liquid scintillator detectors. The near-term physics goal is to improve the sensitivity of neutrino-less double beta decay searches with large underground liquid scintillator experiments, such as the SNO+ experiment. The sensitivity of SNO+ is a function of both the quantity of double beta decay Neodymium isotope that can be dissolved in the scintillator, and the detector's overall energy resolution: more isotope increases the signal, while improved resolutions allow better separation of signal from background. The limit to the total mass of isotope that can be dissolved comes from the competition between the additional statistics and the loss of light due to absorption by Neodymium. This work will carry out a dedicated investigation into the loading of Neodymium nanoparticles, rather than dissolving Neodymium directly, as a way to add more isotope while limiting the level of light lost, thus significantly improving sensitivity to a neutrino-less double beta decay signal. The plan of work includes development of loading techniques to ensure homogeneity and stability within the scintillator, measurements of optical transmission and scattering of the suspensions, measurements of light yield and scintillation timing profiles, and simulation and analysis to determine the impact of nanoparticle solutions on SNO+'s sensitivity to neutrino-less double beta decay. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>The question of whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle is not only the most pressing question in neutrino physics, it also has implications for the origin of the current preponderance of matter over antimatter in our Universe. The techniques that will be investigated here can also be applied equally well to other liquid-scintillator detectors, including planned very large-scale detectors such as LENS. They may also be useful for the loading of any non-double beta decay isotope, for purposes that could go well beyond neutrino physics. The work described here will also play an important role in the training and education of young researchers. It is very well-suited to the involvement of undergraduates, both in hands-on activities as well as simple data analysis and simulation."
0.158333,"The main goal of this project is to study quantum entanglement, which is arguably the most perplexing feature of the already confusing theory of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the microscopic world--elementary particles, atoms, molecules, photons and so on--allows particles to be at many places at the same time, a property called superposition. If several particles are in a superposition state, then their individual properties may become ""entangled"" in such a way that detecting one of the particles will affect the other particles even though there is no direct physical connection between them. Dubbed ""spooky action at a distance"" by Albert Einstein, this property has no classical physics analog, and its understanding is essential for verifying the validity of quantum mechanics. This seemingly esoteric property also has important practical applications and implications for a rapidly developing new technology: quantum computation and quantum communication. Quantum computers should be able to break computational speed records using exotic algorithms; their very existence requires strong quantum entanglement between the quantum bits, or ""qubits"", which form the basis of their operation. Quantum communication channels can transmit data with the highest possible levels of security; the reliability and range of these channels depends crucially on the ability to generate entanglement.<br/><br/>The PI's will use trapped Ba ion qubits and the ion-photon entanglement protocol to generate long distance entanglement between the ions. The long (~1 km) range is needed to close both the locality loophole (which requires the measurements on the two qubits to be outside of each other's light cone) and the detection, or fair sampling, loophole (which requires that the detection efficiency is high) in the same experiment. The photons emitted by the ions will be sent though optical fibers and measured in a partial Bell state analyzer, a process which in turn entangles the distant ions via entanglement swapping."
1.682889,"This collaborative award to the University of Washington and Cornell University funds the development of a calorimeter detector that would be used to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This quantity is of fundamental interest because of discrepancies between a recent measurement and theoretical predictions of the standard model of particle physics.

If the discrepancy is confirmed, it would imply the existence of new subatomic particles, so far undetected, and would fundamentally reshape our understanding of the world around us."
0.3,"Unprecedented levels of seismic isolation are required to achieve the sensitivity necessary to observe gravitational waves in Advanced LIGO. This award supports the development of instruments and techniques to ammeliorate the effect of seismic vibrations on the overall detector performance. The active seismic isolation stages in Advanced LIGO employ seismometers located on the ground and on the isolated platform to measure and subtract ground motion. However, horizontal seismometers cannot distinguish between ground tilt and horizontal acceleration. Tilt-horizontal coupling complicates the feedback and is a significant noise source for seismic isolation in Advanced LIGO. This award supports the development of a high precision inertial sensor to measure horizontal tilt independently from horizontal acceleration. Removing tilt and tilt noise from the horizontal seismometer channels will improve Advanced LIGO seismic isolation.<br/><br/>The tiltmeters we are developing are unique and not commercially available. These instruments may have applications in other fields of science such as in geophysics, well beyond gravitational wave research. This award not only supports the development of a device for Advanced LIGO but it also serves to maintain and strengthen synergistic activities of our table-top gravity group with the gravitational wave detection community. The technical developments and experiments are carried out by a university-based research group, which has a strong tradition of educating undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs in building precision mechanical instruments. With the expertise gained through projects, such as developing a one-of-a-kind tiltmeter, our students fill positions in academia as well as highly skilled positions in industry.

A glaring deficiency in our understanding of those laws is the role played by time reversal symmetry violation, the connection between time and the physical forces. Because an electric dipole moment (EDM) can exist only if time-reversal symmetry is violated, the mercury EDM project will search for time reversal symmetry violation within the mercury atom. The size of the EDM will shed light on the correct description of the laws of nature. The signature of an EDM is a shift of the nuclear spin precession frequency (the signal used in MRI machines) when an electric field is applied to the atoms. The experiment will measure the effect of an electric field on the precession frequency to unprecedented accuracy and perhaps be the first experiment to detect a non-vanishing EDM.<br/><br/>The notion of time reversal symmetry and its violation appeals to the general public as well as a broad physics community. Within physics, EDM experiments are of interest to the atomic, nuclear, high energy, and astrophysics communities, both experimentalists and theorists alike. The mercury EDM project is a ""table-top"" experiment, giving graduate, undergraduate, and high school students the opportunity to work locally on a small-scale experiment in which they can explore fundamental issues normally studied only by large groups at high energy accelerators. These students gain experience in exquisite technology with atoms, lasers and electronics, and in turn help make advances in this technology that they take with them to their future careers. The techniques developed to measure nuclear spin precession frequencies to unprecedented accuracy are transferred to researchers in other fields where precision magnetometry is paramount."
0.303926,"This grant will support a project to sensitively measure the interaction between light and matter. The experiments will be performed on an atomic gas cooled to very low temperatures in the laboratory, at which point it transforms into an exotic state called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Like a laser beam, the BEC can be split into multiple parts and then recombined. If the different parts interact differently with light, then this shows up in the properties of the recombined BEC. By using light pulses to split, recombine, and then observe BECs, the group will precisely measure the strength of the light-matter interaction. Their results will provide information regarding possible refinements of the underlying theory of this fundamental process. The atom they are studying (Ytterbium) has potential applications in the development of improved time standards for the global positioning system (GPS) and in the development of quantum computers; both of these efforts involve the sorts of laser-atom control techniques that the group is helping to advance in this project. The students working on the project will gain experience in experimental methods involving atoms, lasers, and electronics, and also be involved in data analysis, modeling, and connecting experimental results with theory. This will form good preparation for them to join the work force in academics and industry as part of the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The kinetic energy of an atom recoiling due to absorption of a single photon will be precisely measured as a frequency, by further development of the group's demonstrated contrast interferometry technique with ytterbium BECs. This recoil frequency, combined with other measurements, will accurately determine the fine structure constant alpha, and test the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The fine structure constant is ubiquitous in nature, and QED theory extends across various physics sub-fields. Continued refinement is of fundamental importance. The contrast interferometer utilizes pulsed optical standing waves to split and recombine BECs. The interferometer signal is obtained by monitoring the contrast of the resultant interference pattern via reflection of an optical traveling wave. In addition to testing QED, the group's interferometry technique will advance BEC manipulation methods, and will be used to study many-body phenomena, such as the BEC phase transition."
1.35,"The University of Washington Eot-Wash Group will develop specialized instruments with unprecedented sensitivity for the ultra-weak forces suggested by some modern explanations for the apparent accelerated expansion of the Universe and by theoretical attempts to unify gravity with the other three fundamental forces. In particular, we will enhance the sensitivity to violations of the weak equivalence principle by a factor of about 10. This will test a key postulate of Einstein's laws of gravity, provide a laboratory test of the gravitational property of galactic dark matter, close a loophole in the ongoing Lunar-Laser-Ranging test of the strong equivalence principle, probe speculations about the source of the mysterious ""dark energy"" that apparently comprises two thirds of the total mass-energy of the Universe, set stringent constraints on Lorentz-symmetry-violation in gravity, and probe any idea that predicts ultra-feeble ""fifth"" forces. Additionally we will test Newton's inverse-square law down to length scales substantially smaller than the diameter of a human hair. This will probe for ""large"" extra dimensions, test a possible explanation for the observed smallness of the cosmological constant and rule out a large class of ""chameleon"" theories that were proposed to hide the many long-range interactions generated by string theories. These tests should be able to probe new gravitational-strength interactions with length scales down to 20 micrometers. We will search for new short-range spin-spin forces arising from exotic bosons using an electron-spin polarized pendulum/attractor instrument with 10-fold rotational symmetry.<br/><br/>Because open questions about gravity are central to the gravitational, elementary-particle and cosmology communities and fascinate the scientifically literate community as well, (could anti-matter fall differently from matter? could the extra dimensions predicted by string theories have detectable effects? could dark matter have unusual long-range fields? is gravity truly the weakest force or could there be a whole regime of ultra-weak forces?) the Eot-Wash Group's work continues to have an unusually broad impact. Their results are widely disseminated through publications, invited talks and colloquia, invited review articles, lab tours, meetings with undergraduates at other universities and colleges, public lectures, and have been featured in magazine and newspaper articles in this country and in Europe. Group members have created a chapter on gravity and feature in a video documentary for the Annenberg Course ""Physics for the 21st Century"". The group's work has been featured in articles in Nature and The Economist and in an episode of ""Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman"". The broad range of scientific issues addressed by the Eot-Wash Group and the many technical challenges involved provide an excellent education in experimental physics and in high-tech instrumentation for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as unusually attractive opportunities for undergraduate research projects."
0.15,"Neutrinos are some of the most intriguing elementary particles that make up the Standard Model of particle physics. They were long thought to have no mass, don?t interact with much of anything, and may hold the key to why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe. Neutrinos are commonly observed in beta decay, a radioactive process that involves the emission of an electron (or its antiparticle the positron) from the nucleus, and which is always accompanied by the emission of a neutrino (or its antiparticle the antineutrino) as well. This research focuses on the search for what is called neutrino-less double beta decay, where an initial nucleus with atomic weight and number (A,Z) is transformed into a nucleus of (A, Z + 2) with the emission of only two electrons and nothing else. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, this can only happen if neutrinos and antineutrinos are exactly the same, that is, the neutrino is its own antiparticle. It is believed that this overlap between matter and antimatter could prove essential in answering one of the most fundamental questions in science: why is our Universe made exclusively of matter?<br/><br/>The research uses the NEMO-3 and SuperNEMO experiments. The NEMO-3 experiment employed thin foils of particular nuclear isotopes surrounded by detectors that could provide 3D particle tracking of the decay electrons. This unique technique provides several observables for each registered event, offering a powerful means to identify double beta decays and to reject background processes. SuperNEMO will further exploit the NEMO-3 technique. The research group supported by this award will continue its participation in the NEMO-3 data analysis and in the construction of the first SuperNEMO module (""Demonstrator""). Through their activities, the group will educate and train young researchers in building state-of-the-art research instruments and science projects. They will work towards building on the University of Texas at Austin campus an exhibit gallery illustrating the discovery, the underlying physics, and applications of natural radioactivity, cosmic rays, and related subatomic phenomena. <br/><br/>The NEMO-3 analysis has already yielded high precision measurements of double beta half-lives for seven isotopes and set some of the most stringent constraints on the neutrino-less transitions, yielding an upper limit for the effective neutrino mass of (0.3-0.9)eV, where the span reflects uncertainties in the nuclear matrix element. The SuperNEMO aspects include designing and fabrication of the central source foil frame, the light injection and calorimeter monitoring system, and the Bi-207 calibration deployment. For the next three years, a critical period for completing and commissioning the Demonstrator, the group will complete hardware commitments and will participate in analysis of data from the new experiment."
0.149963,"The space between organels in a living cell called cytosol is a medium crowded with molecules. It is estimated that 30% of its volume is taken up by macromolecules, proteins and nucleic acids. While a small subset of these molecules can be interacting biochemically with a particular enzyme, the vast majority is chemically inert and is just occupying volume around the enzyme. The consequences of crowding are that more compact structures are favored in crowded media since they free up volume for the crowding molecules to occupy, thus increasing the overall entropy of the system. While this qualitative picture is simple and has borne out in some experiments, a more quantitative understanding of the consequences of crowding on protein function remains scanty, and more so in relation to molecular machines. This project will bring better quantitative understanding of crowding in cells using an experimental system that is amenable to precision measurements and manipulation of molecular motors. Recent studies have linked the down regulation of motor activity to various diseases. The rationale for the proposed studies is that the identification of the mechanisms by which multiple motors and motor co-factors cooperate to haul cargoes in the complex environment of the cell will lead to a fundamental framework for eventual understanding of how failure of these mechanisms is linked to disease. With the latter in mind, the impact of the project will in part be achieved by taking part in training a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students who are proficient in working in the interdisciplinary environment of the proposed activity and who will advance the field as they proceed in their careers. The principal investigator has, and will continue to disseminate the findings of his research program among the general public through high school student internships in his laboratory and through lectures to the students, their parents and their teachers in area high schools. <br/><br/>The PI will use two such machines, the molecular motor proteins kinein-1 and cytoplasmic dynein, to investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding on the function of these enzymes. Motor proteins bind and shuttle cargo inside the cell by stepping along the cytoskeletal filaments. The motors choreographed mechano-chemical cycle has been well characterized in dilute buffer over the past three decades. A single step of a motor involves multiple events of ligand-substrate binding and conformational changes all of which can be modulated by crowders. Indeed, preliminary findings in the PI's lab show that kinesin motility is altered in the presence of crowders. The aims of the proposed work seek to determine the details of this altered function by probing and manipulating motors down to the single molecule level, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the consequences of the altered function of motors on emergent properties of multiple motors hauling cargo within the cell will be established. This work will also address the need to quantify crowding within the heterogeneous cellular makeup. To that end the PI will develop and calibrate a molecular sensor that can report on the local crowding state within the cell. The function of motors will be studied in their native environment as a function of crowding. A crowding sensor is a general tool that will be a crucial leap towards quantitative understanding of the role crowding plays in biological processes."
0.1,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Vadim Kaplunovsky at the University of Texas at Austin. His work focuses on several aspects of string theory -- which unifies gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature (strong, weak, and electromagnetic). String theory has an unusual property - it contains something called ""holographic dualities"", which relate theories in many-body quantum systems (ranging from quark-gluon plasma to superconductors) to theories of gravity in higher dimensional spaces. These dualities, since they relate to very different systems, allow calculations in one system to give results in the other. Professor Kaplunovsky studies the duality between forms of super-dense nuclear matter and models with crystal-like structures, as well as the duality between models of gravity in highly curved spaces with strongly interacting particle physics models. He also studies string theories which are dual to each other. All these projects are deeply connected to other aspects of string theory as well as to particle physics, nuclear physics, and condensed matter. To enhance the broader impact of his research, Professor Kaplunovsky will give a series of talks to high-school students about hot issues of modern physics (which alas are not even mentioned in a regular curriculum). The subjects may involve fundamental particles, cosmology, or anything else the students may be interested in. Prof. Kaplunovsky will also give a series of more advanced lectures about theoretical physics to the undergraduate students at the University of Texas and at other universities in the US and overseas.<br/><br/>Prof. Kaplunovsky's research focuses on several issues of string theory and holographic QCD. One project is about infinite crystals of YM instantons -- which 'live' in 4+1 dimensions (where they act as particles) but may form lower-dimensional lattices in external potentials. There are many types of such crystals, with different lattice geometries and/or different patterns of instantons' isospin orientations. The project focuses on surveying such crystals and the phase transitions between them, especially the transitions which change the dimensionality of the lattice (3D->4D, or 2D->3D, or 1D->2D). Another project focuses on leading order (in alpha') stringy corrections to the hadron spectra in high-curvature holographic QCD models with O(1) 't Hooft couplings. A related issue concerns stringy corrections to the short-distance nuclear forces in models where the dual baryons looks like string stars rather than instantons. The third project is about M theory duals of the heterotic orbifolds, which seem to give paradoxical results, and he hopes to come up with a solution to these puzzles."

0.342,"This project is focused on the understanding of the production of reactive species when plasmas interact with liquids. Plasmas in and in contact with liquids are one of the most exciting and important intellectual frontiers in plasma science, with broad potential applications ranging from environmental remediation and green chemistry to biomedical applications. The complex interaction of plasmas with liquids offers a rich source of short-lived chemically reactive species, many of which are critical for chemical and biological applications. Plasmas are often considered to be an advanced oxidation technology for liquid waste treatment and also have great promise in the destruction of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. The presence of these pharmaceuticals in the water supply is an increasing public concern and for several cases no alternative technologies exist to remove them from drinking water. In addition, plasmas in liquids can be used for environmentally friendly chemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen and even nanoparticles. Producing hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide from water with better energy efficiency than electrolysis or other chemical processes would be a major step forward. The nanoparticles in the context of advanced material science could also strongly affect energy research that increasingly uses complex nanostructured materials. <br/><br/>Since energy efficiency is often a bottleneck for applications of plasmas in liquids, a better understanding of the reactive species production in these plasmas is the necessary step to lead to a breakthrough in technologies based on plasmas in liquids. To date, progress in the field of plasmas in liquids has been hindered by the lack of quantitative correlations between plasma properties and the plasma induced liquid phase chemistry. The key idea of this project is to generate a non-equilibrium plasma filament in liquid water by a nanosecond pulsed high voltage supply in a needle-needle electrode geometry. This offers an excellent control of the plasma dynamics and allows detailed investigation of a stabilized plasma filament. The short-lived reactive species production mechanisms will be investigated both temporally and spatially resolved by a combination of advanced laser diagnostics. In addition, plasma induced liquid reactivity will be measured and a direct link between plasma chemistry and liquid phase chemistry will be established. This is expected to lead to the necessary knowledge for optimizing and establishing many promising applications as stated above. This project enables education of students and a post-doctoral researcher in the cross-disciplinary field of plasma engineering. The outcomes of this work will be used to extend an existing graduate course on Plasma Technology to cover non-equilibrium liquid phase plasmas including laboratory demonstrations. Within the framework of the project, collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota will be initiated to establish an exhibit about plasmas."
0.087293,"Coral ecosystems are of significant interest to conservationists because of their remarkable diversity. Coral reefs, in comparison to colonies of soft corals, are composed of hard corals with calcium carbonate skeletons. One significant difference between the two corals is that the soft coral of the family Xeniidae actively pulse, and this energetically expensive behavior has been shown to enhance photosynthesis rates by an order of magnitude. The central goal of this proposal is to describe how these active movements might give soft coral a competitive advantage through augmented photosynthetic rates under certain environmental conditions. The broad focus of this project is to determine how active movements of flexible organisms enhance particle capture and nutrient exchange. In particular the PIs will study species of the family Xeniidae, the pulsing soft corals, using a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments. This work will develop mathematical models to represent poroelastic structures representative of the feathery tentacles of the corals. The PIs will also develop adaptive numerical methods for handling the flux of nutrients at these moving elastic boundaries. Two graduate students and four undergraduates will be trained at the interface of scientific computing, mathematical modeling, and experimental biology. The PIs willrecruit a diverse group of undergraduate students through established mechanisms at each institution. Several educational activities will be implemented to promote computation in biophysics, including the development of quantitative biology labs.<br/><br/>The following specific aims will be addressed in this project: Aim 1: Determine how the pulsing dynamics of a single polyp affects the bulk transport of fluid past the organism and the small scale mixing around the surface of the organism. Aim 2: Determine how the pulsing action enhances particle capture, the exchange of nutrients, and removal of waste. Aim 3: Determine whether or not the group pulsing dynamics are optimized for exchange using network analysis and computational fluid dynamics."
0.156,"Dark matter and neutrino properties are among the most compelling problems to be studied in modern physics. Dark matter particles may be detected through the observation of nuclear recoils produced when they scatter with nuclei in a target. Nuclear recoils can also be created when neutrinos coherently scatter with nuclei. This process, if ever observed, would help in probing non-standard neutrino interactions, searching for sterile neutrinos, and understanding the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae. Both scattering rates increase dramatically as the energies of nuclear recoils go down. The lower the energy threshold of a detector, the more events can be detected. <br/><br/>Recent activity in the SURF underground laboratory stimulated support from the South Dakota state to the expansion of PhD programs at state universities. The activity planned with this award provides an opportunity for a PhD student to take part in research related to underground science. The activity may also pave the way for practical applications of undoped NaI/CsI at 77 K in civil uses. For example, un-doped NaI at 77 K has a much faster scintillation signal than NaI/CsI(Tl) at room temperature. It can be used to improve the time and position resolution of PET, resulting in more precise imaging of the concerned tissue of a patient.<br/><br/>A straight forward way to lower the energy threshold of a scintillation detector is to increase its light yield. This award is focused on optimizing the light readout from un-doped NaI/CsI at 77 K. Both sodium iodide and cesium iodide doped with thallium, NaI/CsI(Tl), are excellent scintillators at room temperature. The PI plans to couple un-doped NaI/CsI directly to the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), cool them down to 77 K to maximize the light readout. Low temperature properties of the PMTs will be compared; dimensions and various surface treatments of un-doped NaI/CsI crystals will be examined to optimize the light collection efficiency. The goal is to verify whether it is possible to lower the energy threshold by a factor of two by increasing the light yield by a factor of two, compared to existing experiments utilizing NaI/CsI(Tl) at room temperature. The decay times of scintillation light from un-doped NaI/CsI at 77 K are quite different from those of NaI/CsI(Tl) at room temperature. Their effect on signal and background discrimination will also be examined."
0.064191,"The main goal of this program is to advance the understanding of the fundamental nature of atomic nuclei, with undergraduate student participation as an integral component. The principle investigator and team of undergraduate students will investigate the structure of light neutron-rich atomic nuclei that do not exist naturally in nature but must be produced at an accelerator facility. Understanding these nuclei is important for advancing our understanding of how the protons and the neutrons bind together in nuclear systems that are very near the limits of existence. As the research program advances to the study of heavier nuclei, results will provide important information for the understanding of explosive astrophysical environments such as supernovae and neutron star mergers. Much of the research will be conducted at Westmont College, which includes student training in and the use of instrumentation and data analysis techniques, and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University, where students participate in state-of-the-art nuclear physics experiments. Major instrumentation used in experiments include the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) and the Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA), both constructed and tested by undergraduate students from several institutions in the MoNA collaboration. In addition to the science goals, an important goal of this program is to provide transformational research experiences for the participating undergraduate students that can have a positive influence on decisions they make for future study and careers in physics. <br/><br/>The research supported by this award addresses directly some of the main questions driving the field of nuclear science today. Properties of ground and excited states of neutron-rich nuclei will be investigated using the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA), the Large multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA), and the Sweeper Magnet and its associated suite of charged particle detectors, all located at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. Goals of the program include a conclusive measurement of the 10He ground state resonance energy, precise measurement of the 26O ground state lifetime, analysis of the 2-neutron cascade decay of excited states of 24O, and a systematic study of neutron scattering in the MoNA detector bars at the LANSCE facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This research program will help advance knowledge of nuclear structure far from stability, including better understanding of neutron-rich nuclei near the dripline, neutron halo systems, and exotic forms of nuclear decay including multiple neutron decays and 2-neutron radioactivity."
0.477663,"In this project, the PI will study how the diversity of the constituents influence the principles of self-organization that underlie network phenomena. As the fraction of inhibitory neurons within a network of excitatory and inhibitory Neurons changes, the PI hypothesizes that one can elucidate the underlying functional rules that are present despite the absence of native anatomy. Using multi-electrode arrays the PI will characterize network dynamical function to generate new testable hypotheses. This project will address a fundamental question: How does modulating the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio influence synaptic tuning to adapt while maintaining a stable state? In this project the PI will vary this ratio by adding striatal cells (inhibitory) to single cell suspensions of hippocampal (excitatory) neurons and record spontaneous electrical network activity. The excitability will be increased by using a pharmacological paradigm for long-term potentiation, a mechanism believed to be the cellular basis of learning and memory. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy imaging studies will assess the distribution of synapses for these ratios. The proposed study will not only increase our understanding from an experimental perspective of how robustness and adaptability can coexist in networks of neurons, but results will provide a framework that can be used to develop realistic computational models. These techniques and concepts will be disseminated to a broader audience to students from Howard University as well as underrepresented minority students at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA. Undergraduate and graduate education will be impacted through the teaching of the Research Modules for the Cognitive Science undergraduate program and the Neurons in Action 2 summer workshop that encompasses graduate students from Howard University and incoming Georgetown University graduate students in the Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience."
0.1,"The spatial orientation of an experiment should never affect its outcome. For light, this principle has been tested in the famous Michelson-Morley experiment leading to the basic principle in physics known as ""Lorentz invariance"" and, more generally, Einstein's theory of Special Relativity. Modern theories of matter require that not only light but also all other particles should be invariant to rotations. The goal of the experiments in this project will be to perform a Michelson-Morley experiment for electrons. Detecting even tiny energy variations between electrons moving in different directions would mean that space is not isotropic and that we need an entirely new class of theories to describe nature.<br/><br/>For the experiment, a laser pulse will create superpositions of electronic wavepackets inside Calcium ions. Those wavepackets will then evolve independently of each other in orthogonal directions. A second laser pulse will then recombine the wavepackets. The corresponding<br/>interference signal will be directly sensitive to the difference in how the two electronic wavepackets move. The experiments rely heavily on tools developed for ion trap quantum information processing to control and measure the quantum state of individual Calcium ions. In particular, engineering symmetric quantum states of two and more ions makes the signal immune to common noise sources such as magnetic field fluctuations. Thus, the long coherence of the electron motion in combination with accurate control of all relevant systematic error sources will enable testing the isotropy of space and Lorentz invariance at the level of (and beyond) 1 part in ten to the nineteen (nineteen decimal places of accuracy)."
0.2,"This collaborative research project, consisting of four institutions (Rice, Yale, UIUC and Princeton) aims to continue the Physics of Living Systems Student Research Network (PoLS SRN). This network has been in existence for four years and has had a dramatic impact on many graduate students, both in the US and abroad, working on the application of physical science techniques to living systems. These students now can participate in a global community that can help deal with the many complex issues involved in conducting research in such a new and inherently multidisciplinary field. These issues range from proper training, to gaining a broad perspective, to accessing technical expertise that may not be available at their home institution. In addition to the obvious broader impacts related to training of a research workforce, there are other broad impacts of this plan. Via the interaction of one of the PoLS nodes (Rice) with the biomedical community in Houston, students and faculty will be exposed to possible avenues whereby physics can contribute to human health issues. Funds to attract students from under-represented groups to network meetings will be available through the new funds administered by the newly proposed network coordinator. Also deas vetted by the PoLS SRN will be adapted to create student networks in other areas of science and engineering.<br/><br/>There is by now little disagreement with the general notion that concepts and methods from physics have been a critical contributor to the increased understanding of the living world, and that its importance will be growing as the scientific world moves toward an ever more quantitative and predictive form of biology. Thus, the physics community clearly needs to train a new generation of scientists who can lead this effort, scientists who have the right mix of physics/mathematics rigor and broad knowledge of living systems from molecular scales on up. The PoLS SRN aims at creating a community of graduate students who can collectively help themselves and their mentors accelerate and enhance this training process. This is being done by a mix of in-person and virtual modes of communication, and this proposal is a plan to continue and expand these efforts; it will reach more students, improve the social networking portals, and make use of the complementary research agendas of the different network nodes to provide broad technical expertise. Doing all of this, will boost the intellectual level of the entire research field and convince the best students that the Physics of Living Systems is truly the most exciting research frontier in 21st century science.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics, the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry, and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems."
0.075,"Non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas are a new and fascinating type of a plasma that has tremendous potential in medicine and nanotechnology. Our understanding of the atmospheric microplasmas and the nature of the plasma interaction with biological matter is very limited. In this project, we will, in particular, advance the knowledge of atmospheric microplasmas relevant for medical applications. This research program will serve as a vehicle for undergraduate and graduate education in the field of plasma science. The PIs will make a concerted effort to involve women and under-represented minority students in this project by working closely with the relevant student organizations at George Washington University. To recruit women, the Society of Women Engineers will be contacted and informed of the project activities. In addition, undergraduate students will be engaged in the research through the Work Study program or a Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement. The experience will impart them with the knowledge and the skills to excel in independent academic or industry careers they pursue after completing their education. The educational plan for this project also aims to generate interest in science and technology in the area of plasma science and bioengineering and to reach out to K-12 teachers, school children and their parents. In particular, we plan to interact with local schools in the Metropolitan DC area.<br/><br/>The central objective of this project is to understand the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas with a view towards biological applications. To this end we will develop and implement a wide range of new diagnostic methodologies and tools applicable for atmospheric microplasmas. The overall project will address the ionization mechanism, energy balance and conditions for streamer propagation as well as effects related to overvoltage. This project has both fundamental and technological significance. The fundamental significance of this project is in understanding the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas. To this end a wide spectrum of diagnostic instrumentation for atmospheric pressure microplasmas will be developed. Availability of this instrumentation has critical importance for the future progress of the field of atmospheric microplasmas. Enabled by these advances, the technological significance lies in exploring the wide range of applications of atmospheric microplasmas, such as plasma medicine and nanotechnology."
0.06,"A fundamental goal of subatomic physics is the precise determination of the physical properties of subatomic particles such as the proton and neutron. The radius of the proton is one of these properties. The radius can be measured by scattering electrons, or heavier particles called muons, off protons. Another technique is to measure the energy levels of hydrogen, an atom consisting of a proton plus an electron, or muonic hydrogen, an atom consisting of a proton with the electron replaced by a muon. To date, the radius has been measured by scattering of electrons off protons, and by the energy levels of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. The proton radius derived from the measurement of the energy levels in muonic hydrogen disagrees with the radius derived from the measurements of the energy levels in hydrogen, and with the measurements of the proton radius by scattering of electrons, an issue known as ""the proton radius puzzle.""

0.27,"This grant supports the research activities of the Pacific Lattice Group, consisting of Professors James Hetrick, Kieran Holland, and Keisuke Juge at the University of the Pacific.<br/><br/>This project concerns computational field theory in particle physics. There are four strands in this work, three involving theoretical study of strongly-interacting particles and one managing a scientific data archive gateway. The thrust of the first strand is to understand from basic principles how a few fundamental building blocks, the quarks and gluons of QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics), generate the experimentally observed hadrons, such as the proton, neutron and other exotic particles, as well their properties and interactions. This work has significant relevance for nuclear physics. The second and third branches of this research program explore models of physics ""Beyond the Standard Model"", in particular investigating the possibility that the newly discovered Higgs particle might be a composite of ""quark-like"" particles, or even a manifestation of extra dimensional physics. Finally, the fourth part of this research program is the maintenance of a large, public, internationally accessible repository of lattice gauge theory data, allowing researchers around the world to access and build on the work of others, thereby significantly leveraging the investment in this work and that of other similar researchers.<br/><br/>The broader significance of this work is to advance our current understanding of the fundamental constituents, structure, and interactions of matter and the universe. The Standard Model of particle physics encapsulates the way that quarks and leptons interact, and explains all known accelerator data. This Model is much like the Periodic Table in chemistry at the turn of the 18th century: we have the table and its mathematical description of the interactions of its constituents, but we have no understanding of why the interactions take the form and structure that they do. In chemistry, the deeper understanding of the Periodic Table came with the next level of physics --- quantum theory, explaining why atoms have the properties and interactions that they do. We are at a similar crossroads now in our understanding of particle physics and the Standard Model, poised to break through to the next level of understanding of the structure of matter, and the results of this research project might potentially be one step in that direction. On the other hand, the data archive management component of this project uses the latest high-performance grid technologies to make the results of this work and other researchers around the world available to each other, greatly multiplying the return on the scientific investment made by the public."
0.135,"This collaborative research project will advance fundamental understanding of how groups of high speed ions crash into and interact with each other. One can measure just how violent a collision is by comparing the energy of the crashing high-speed ions with the electrical force between them. The most violent ion collisions, the ones that are most important both for extending our scientific knowledge and for developing technological applications, are very difficult to measure or calculate. They occur in extremely hot and very dense gases of charged particles called plasmas. In this project, new ideas will be used to measure and understand these collisions. Lasers will be used to slow atoms from speeds of nearly 1000 meters per second to a crawl of about an inch per second; and then to turn these slow atoms into ions. Additional lasers will then be used to measure how these ions crash into each other. The ions in these slow-motion collisions have the same amount of crash energy compared to the ion-ion electrical force, which means that the collision results can be directly compared to similar collisions at any energy. This project will use state-of-the-art large-scale computer simulations to make movies of the ion-ion collisions and compare these to the experimental measurements. When the computations are proven to be sufficiently accurate, approximations will be gradually introduced and tested in order to speed up the computations. These results will then set the standard for accurate and fast computations of ion collisions in plasmas. Several students will work on this project: Undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral scientists will work closely with expert scientists at Willamette University (Oregon), Brigham Young University (Utah), and the New Mexico Consortium (New Mexico).<br/><br/>The proposed collaborative research project will investigate energy relaxation in a system in which the value of the Coulomb logarithm is small. This is typical of high-energy-density systems, where violent small-impact-parameter collisions result in large particle deflections. Understanding these collisions is a priority for advancing fundamental plasma physics and for accurately modeling small impact parameter collisions in high energy density plasmas. The proposed work will generate high quality data in plasma regimes where traditional diagnostics are limited. The proposed work will combine data from a new dual-species ultracold neutral plasma experiment and state-of-the-art simulations to study temperature equilibration in moderately coupled plasmas, in which classic plasma assumptions are invalid. The dual-species plasma will be generated by resonantly photo-ionizing laser-cooled Yb and Ca atoms in the same magneto-optical trap. Laser-induced fluorescence measurements will be used to measure the time-evolving ion velocity distribution for each ion species simultaneously. By delaying the ionization of one species relative to the other, the time scale for full energy relaxation can be determined. State-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations will be performed that match the density, stoichiometry, and geometry of the experiments. The calculations will provide a first-principles description of collision processes by directly integrating many-body trajectories. Arbitrarily complicated orbits will be computed self-consistently with dynamical many-body screening. The many-body phase dynamics will be inverted to yield highly accurate effective Coulomb logarithms, providing important information back to the high energy density community. This project will support one graduate student per year for three years at BYU, two undergraduate students per year at BYU, two undergraduate students per year at WU, and one post-doc per year for two years at NMC."

0.045,"The study of fundamental symmetries in the field of nuclear physics explores the nature of the matter, energy, and forces that define the universe and that have allowed stars, planets, and life to emerge and flourish. This award will support the PI and undergraduate students to work on two experiments that will further our understanding of that universe. The first experiment, called MuSun, addresses one of the most important limitations of calculations related to the proton-proton fusion process that releases most of the energy in stars like the Sun. It will provide data that will calibrate the least precise parts of these calculations and can also be applied to other important nuclear reactions. The second, known as the Muon g-2 experiment, tests our Standard Model of particles and their interactions. While this model has been remarkably successful, it is not complete. The previous generation of this experiment uncovered a strong hint of a discrepancy between its measurement and the Standard Model's prediction; the new experiment will probe it with enough precision to potentially claim a discovery.<br/><br/>Students will have opportunities to carry out guided research related to the larger physics goals, to work at major research facilities, and to attend conferences and collaboration meetings. This grant will provide opportunities to involve and support a talented and diverse group of science students that includes women, members of underrepresented ethnic groups, and first-generation college students.<br/><br/>MuSun measures the rate of muon capture in deuterium, a fundamental two-nucleon process that provides a calibration of effective field theories of weak interactions in light nuclei. The muon capture process studied by the MuSun experiment is analogous to reactions that include proton-proton fusion and the deuteron breakup reactions that were used to detect neutrinos at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The MuSun result will dramatically improve the precision of the low-energy constants describing two-nucleon terms in chiral effective field theories that describe these reactions. The Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab will be the group's primary focus for this grant period. This experiment measures the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon by observing the rate of spin precession of a muon beam as it circulates in a precisely shimmed storage ring magnet. The spin polarization precesses because of coupling to virtual particles, including all of the particles described by the Standard Model and potentially any new, as-yet-undiscovered particles and interactions that are beyond it. The Regis group will be responsible for the implementation, installation, commissioning, and analysis for the fiber harp beam monitors and entrance counters for this experiment. The measurement clearly has the potential to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. When the existing precision of 0.5 parts per million from the Brookhaven National Laboratory experiment is compared with modern Standard Model calculations, there is a discrepancy of more than three standard deviations; the probability of a fluctuation at this level by chance is less than one in a thousand. As the precision of the experiment reaches its 0.14 part-per-million goal, the discrepancy could exceed the discovery threshold of five standard deviations. Such a finding could represent the discovery of supersymmetry, new gauge bosons such as dark photons, or other new particles or interactions."

With this award the Penn State group will continue to use DeepCore data to address fundamental questions of neutrino physics, including testing whether the observed muon neutrino oscillations lead to tau neutrino appearance, or whether extra, sterile neutrino flavors are involved in neutrino oscillations. The Penn State group will also use IceCube and DeepCore to facilitate searches for astrophysical neutrinos from accelerators of cosmic rays. DeepCore will enhance IceCube's ability to identify tau neutrino events at energies of around 1 PeV. Real-time searches for such events can be used to identify astrophysical transient events associated with cosmic ray acceleration. In addition, the group is studying the feasibility of implementing an even more powerful atmospheric neutrino detector in the Antarctic ice cap, known as PINGU, which might have the ability to probe the neutrino mass hierarchy. This could provide extremely valuable input to fundamental theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/>The Penn State group offers a summer professional development workshop for secondary school teachers, which exposes them to forefront research in particle astrophysics.

Gravitational lensing is a cosmological probe that has the advantage of being sensitive to all matter in the Universe: baryonic and dark matter. The growth of dark matter structure is a sensitive probe of the physics of dark energy. <br/><br/>With this award, the Stanford group will play a leadership role in a high-priority effort in observational cosmology through the proposed Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration. The LSST is the first ground-based telescope being designed from scratch to address the severe demands on systematic uncertainties needed to fully exploit weak gravitational lensing as a cosmological probe. The LSST will also address cosmological questions through studies of the growth of large scale structure, baryon acoustic oscillations and Type Ia supernovae. The group will study the experimental challenges to achieving the maximum sensitivity to dark energy through several observational probes, with a focus on gravitational lensing. This effort will be based on analytical and computational techniques, and on detailed simulations of the LSST system. They will contribute to the development of high fidelity simulations and, where appropriate, use existing imaging data to develop and test the understanding of systematic effects that will impact LSST. <br/><br/>The work with LSST simulations and astronomical data provides opportunities for students and postdocs to gain skills in statistics, data analysis, and handling large data sets that are in high demand in the private and public sectors.

There is also a need to image deeper still into hippocampus and other subcortical structures without excavated overlying tissue, as well as to determine the loci of vascular control throughout gray and while matter. The initial proposed experiments, all of which depend on the proposed instrument, address topics in fundamental brain science as well biomedicine. Fundamental issues revolve around neuronal plasticity and memory formation and include: the formation of motor memories, where the learning of a behavioral task is believed to follow from the formation of patterns of correlated neuronal output in motor cortex; the transformation of sensory signals in cortex into memory traces, such as learned fear via the amygdala and induction of depression via the habenula; the role of specific gene products, known as inducible transcription factors, in synaptic plasticity; and understanding how the prodigious adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb is integrated into ongoing olfactory function. More applied issues concern the role of exposure to nicotine alone in changing the basis for memory formation, as well as issues in vasodynamics, including the locus for neuronal control of its own nutriment supply through the cortical vasculature and the impact of microinfarctions on cell death within the white matter, where myelinated fibers traffic information from sensory to motor areas that span the cortical mantle. Realization of this system will permit training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in state of the art in vivo optical imaging. UC San Diego, along with the greater La Jolla scientific community, supports a large and highly collaborative neuroscience community with graduate students and fellows who will pursue careers at institutes throughout the county, even the world. They will be inspired to think of new experiments based on the capabilities of imaging new vistas in the brain, as well as new associated technologies, particularly in the design of optical probes of yet unmeasured variables. Lastly, the high density of potential users within this community will facilitate unanticipated refinements of deep imaging and perhaps transform the proposed development project into a turn-key design for the benefit of the global neurosciences communities. <br/><br/><br/>The PI proposes to build an instrument, whose design is motivated by three threads of work, that enables two- and three-photon imaging throughout the full depth of cortex and into deeper structures. First is the use of 100-fs pulsed laser light at wavelengths of 1.3 or 1.7 micrometers, where scattering is minimized but absorption by water is still weak; second is the use of an optical amplifier to increase the energy per pulse and drive fluorescence at greater depths, and third is the use of aberration corrective optics to counteract distortion of the incident beam with increasing depth into brain tissue."
0.224076,"This award is one component of a collaborative effort to fund the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) Science Education Center Partnership between Southern University in Baton Rouge (SUBR), LA, the LIGO Livingston site in Livingston, La, through the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF), and the Exploratorium. The managing institution for LIGO itself is California Institute of Technology. The project is the continuation of the LIGO Science Education Center Partnership focused on scientific outreach to the general public, teacher training, and teacher education focused on LIGO activities in Louisiana. A previous award helped create the SEC building, with a classroom and a large exhibit hall, with exhibits developed by the Exploratorium and staffed by SUBR student docents and a (separately funded) professional staff. The multilayered partnership of HBCUs, a cutting edge research facility and a renowned informal science center created a model for future partnerships. With the expansion of this partnership the model is extended, and research on the effects of these extensive partnerships can provide information for future attempts at leveraging the resources of research laboratories for educational purposes.<br/><br/>This project will use the LIGO-SEC Partnership to amplify and nurture a Science, Technology, Engineering, Education and Mathematics (STEEM) pipeline that taps into under-represented audiences and engages them in techniques that encourage students to advance their education in STEEM fields. The docent program and the teacher programs will increase participation of under-represented audiences within the STEEM fields. The docent program will train between sixty and eighty under-represented STEEM majors to become community ambassadors in conjunction with LIGO Science Education Center's outreach program, and the docents will interact with between 12,500 and 5,000 participants. The teacher professional development activities target high-need areas in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The activities will develop around 250 teachers' familiarity with engineering design processes and underlying science concepts. These teachers will create and build interactive science activities to use in the classroom to engage with students. Graduate students will conduct new research in the use of inquiry and informal science methods within the formal (School) and informal (LIGO-SEC) environments. The graduate students' dissertations will contribute to the literature on Informal Science Education. The project is guided by an on-going evaluation."
0.033,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose presence we only infer gravitationally, is unknown in its nature, and is termed dark matter. Particle physics suggests that dark matter comprises relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to small interaction probabilities and large backgrounds. The motion of the Earth through the galaxy produces a head-wind of WIMPs. The angular distribution of recoils from WIMP interactions has a ~100% asymmetry, and is modulated at the sidereal rate on account of the Earth's rotation. No known background can mimic this signal. <br/><br/>The practical implications of the technology being developed for such searches have promising applications to low background alpha and neutron measurements. This work also includes the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience.<br/><br/>The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment leads the field of directional dark matter detection. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's sensitivity to this modulated signature, which provides a unique window into one of the most important questions in science today. NSF-funded DRIFT-IId work over the last several years has led to enormous experimental progress. The collaboration is in the final stages of commissioning a new DRIFT-IIe detector. The operation of both detectors will test the viability of long-duration background-free exposures. This award will provide funding to continue the operations of DRIFT-II."
0.482302,"A better understanding of the relationship between brain structure and function is an integral component of the on-going efforts aimed at developing a better understanding of the human mind. Fundamental research is required to accelerate the development of new technologies for neuroscience and near engineering in order to address important societal needs with respect to the development of new ways to treat, prevent, and cure brain disorders. In this larger context, this collaborative project will extend methods of statistical physics to bridge from microscopic neurobiological observations of neurons, axons and dendrites to the mesoscopic images of brain organization seen in diffusion MRI images of the entire primate brain. A particular focus will be to address the question of how the processes of the brain might exploit this special architecture for the representation and processing of information, and in particular, how this regular structure might support time-coding and synchronization of information across the brain.<br/><br/>Joining a physics laboratory, a neurobiology laboratory, and an MRI laboratory, this team will investigates the hypothesis that brain connectivity is geometrically organized, with connectivity generally aligned with the axes of a curved, but essentially orthogonal coordinate system or 3D grid. The idea that the brain of all species with bilateral symmetry is based on an orthogonal plan is not new. It has been recognized in embryology and evolutionary biology for nearly 100 years and more recently has been validated in detail in studies of gene expression. Preliminary studies have suggested that this orthogonal motif pervades the structure of the brain, and particularly connectivity, from macroscopic down to a cellular level. In this interdisciplinary project, the investigators will quantify this phenomenon by looking at structural data from both diffusion MRI and advanced methods of 3D light microscopy and then apply the ideas and tools of condensed matter physics to characterize the structure and circuits of the brain as organized matter. As a first example, having observed 3 orthogonal fiber directions at each point in the brain that vary smoothly, it is natural to model this as a liquid crystal with a deformation energy and temperature. Then, one can investigate its scaling in the brain, and transitions such as those from white matter to gray matter. Functionally, we hypothesize that this rectilinear grid, may provide a new mechanism for neural activity to be temporally correlated, owing to its extremely high degeneracy of path lengths and transmission delays, which we will model as a directed percolation."
3.078369,"Magnetic reconnection, the topological rearrangement of magnetic field, underlies a huge range of explosive and other plasma phenomena at all scales in the universe. It is also ubiquitous in magnetized laboratory plasmas. Its ubiquity, perhaps second to no other plasma phenomenon, is matched by the scientific challenge of its understanding.<br/><br/>The proposed Magnetic Reconnection Device (MRD) will be a multi-user, multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional instrument that will open up new physics regimes for controlled experimental study of magnetic reconnection, regimes that are otherwise unavailable in a controlled laboratory setting. MRD will allow access to dimensionless physics parameters orders of magnitude beyond that presently obtained in dedicated reconnection experiments, increasing the dimensionless electrical conductivity by two orders of magnitude and the dimensionless size by one order of magnitude. This introduces new physics, beyond the standard single-reconnection-site models, that is believed to be active and crucial in nearly all plasmas of interest (space, solar, astrophysical, fusion). The instrument will allow study of the major open questions in reconnection physics: Why is reconnection so fast? When do multiple reconnections occur and how do they affect the reconnection rate? How does partial ionization affect reconnection? How do 3D geometries alter reconnection? What causes the onset of reconnection? How does reconnection accelerate particles to high energy? <br/><br/>Progress in these questions is impeded in other venues: in space observations by the small number of in-situ measurements, in solar and astrophysical observations by the limited spatial resolution of remote sensors, in fusion lab plasmas by limited detector accessibility, and in dedicated reconnection experiments by limitations in dimensionless physics parameters. MRD avoids all these limitations, offering a new instrument designed to discover new insights in reconnection physics. <br/><br/>The interdisciplinarity of this project lies in the marriage of expertise from the areas where is magnetic reconnection is known to occur. That is in the areas spanning a wide variety of spatial scales from astrophysics, to solar physics, to magnetospheric physics, and down to laboratory plasma (fusion physics) scales. Undergraduate plasma physics programs will also be enriched by the availability to do research on the MRD at such institutions as Princeton University, and Swarthmore and Wheaton colleges."
2.839083,"The existence of dark matter is known from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles; Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one possibility. Evidence for WIMPs that could constitute dark matter may come from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN or from sensitive astronomical instruments that detect radiation produced by WIMP-WIMP annihilations in galaxy halos. The orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding for research and development steps to support DarkSide-G2, a second-generation (""G2"") direct WIMP search using a liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with an active mass of 3.3 tons. Liquid argon is a promising medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. This is one of the most powerful background rejection factors among all dark matter detectors, and when combined with the measurement of ionization, background rejection is even further enhanced. The performance of a ton-scale or larger liquid argon TPC would be limited by the high rate of 39-Ar beta decays if atmospheric argon was used. DarkSide-G2 will use argon collected from underground sources which has been shown to have 39-Ar content lower than atmospheric argon by at least a factor of 150. These funds will allow the groups to carry out the detailed mechanical design work necessary to ensure the functionality of the detector, develop necessary high voltage and data acquisition elements, and develop and identify the extremely radiopure detector components and techniques necessary to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: This activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer a continuing opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute a cutting-edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&O programs such as the LNGS-South Dakota-Princeton summer school for high school students."
0.3,"Neuronal circuits in the brainstem are at the ""front-end"" of sensorimotor loops that underlie behavior and cognitive processing. They control life-sustaining functions that include breathing, movement and balance, sniffing, chewing, suckling in neonates, and, in rodents, whisking. These circuits further drive active sensation through taste, smell, balance, and touch. In this project the PI will delimit the circuits that control different motor actions and show how behaviors emerge as an assembly of these actions.<br/><br/>The ""front-end"" circuits of orofacial processing control life-sustaining functions that include breathing, movement and balance, sniffing, chewing, suckling in neonates, whisking in rodents, and vocalization. The functions, some of which share common muscles, must occur without compromising the patency of the airway. The control structure is not understood and nontrivial and it will serve as a model for the control and coordination of concurrent neuronal processes at any level in the nervous system. The application of control theory to nervous systems was proposed by the Cyberneticists of the 1940s to 1960s. These prescient notions were stymied by a lack of experimental tools to identify and control the circuits that underlie behavior. We now have sufficient tools to map brainstem circuits and the PI will exploit the tools of engineering and physics to gain insight into fundamental sensorimotor processes. The technical aspect of the the PI's approach involves the introduction of molecular tools based on the expression of lineage factors and constitutive proteins to identify brainstem neurons and track tracing tools based on trans-synaptic viruses to reveal connectivity The project will contribute to the education and the training of future multidisciplinary scientists through research-based education of undergraduate and graduate students. Technical aspects of work will be broadly disseminated through the involvement of the PIs and colleagues in graduate and post-graduate summer schools."
0.3,"Project: Our perception of the world seems a coherent whole, yet it is built out of the activities of many thousands or even millions of neurons, and similarly for our memories, thoughts, and actions. It seems difficult to understand the emergence of behavioral and phenomenal coherence unless the underlying neural activity also is coherent. But if the neurons are not independent, how do we describe their collective activity? In this work, The PI takes several approaches to this problem. In each case the PI is reaching for a theoretical framework with a generality that transcends the details of particular systems, but in each case the work is grounded by intimate collaboration with several experimental groups. It is now conventional to assert that the emergence of new, larger data sets in the study of biological systems creates a need for new and more efficient methods of data management and analysis. Thus, it is widely expected that the BRAIN initiative, which will provide substantial resources to advance our ability to record simultaneously from many neurons, will also have a significant ""computational"" component related to the storage, handling, and analysis of the huge bodies of data that will be generated. It is much less widely appreciated that making sense of the collective behavior in systems with many interacting degrees of freedom requires theory, not just analysis. The goal of this work is to develop such a theoretical framework.<br/><br/><br/>The PI's collaborators are using multi-electrode arrays to monitor activity in populations of ganglion cells in the vertebrate retina, as well as optical methods to monitor activity in mammalian cortical and hippocampal circuits, and in the whole brain of the nematode C elegans. The PI will use maximum entropy ideas, which have had some success in such problems, to build models of the joint distribution of activity across the hundreds of neurons in each of these experiments. The entropy of this distribution determines the capacity of the network to carry information, and the geometry of the distribution captures intuition about network function. Beyond exploring the distribution of activity, the PI will construct a ""thermodynamics"" for these networks that will allow to place real networks in a phase diagram of possible networks. Finally, the PI will turn to dynamical aspects of network behavior, focusing on the encoding of predictive information. The PI's research is well integrated with teaching at the graduate and undergraduate level, and there will be a special effort to create a ""current topics"" course that brings issues at the interface of physics and biology to the attention of a broader group of students. In addition, the PI is engaged is a series of public outreach efforts, which will culminate in a book for a general audience."
0.556,"The origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the most puzzling questions in high energy particle astrophysics. Its solution may radically change our knowledge of the most extreme astrophysical objects in the Universe, of the magnetic fields which permeate it, or of particle physics. Several open questions remain - What is the origin of the observed features in the energy spectrum? What is the composition of the UHECRs? What are the sources of the UHECRs? In addition, UHECRs explore particle interactions at energies beyond the reach of current accelerators. Are particle interactions above 100 TeV center-of-mass energy what we expect?<br/><br/>This award provides funds for the continued participation of the U. Chicago group with the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and related particle astrophysics. With its 3000 km-squared area, it is the largest cosmic ray detector ever built. Particle showers produced by UHECRs are detected at the ground by a sparse array of surface detectors (SD), and in the atmosphere by fluorescence detector (FD) telescopes sensitive to the light from nitrogen fluorescence excited by the shower particles. Since its completion in 2008, the PAO has unequivocally established a steep flux suppression at the end of the energy spectrum, found hints of anisotropies in the UHECRs arrival directions and indications of a heavier UHECR composition at the highest energies. This group will address these questions by improving Auger measurements (spectrum, anisotropy, composition, proton-air cross section) with better statistics and data analysis methods, and by providing phenomenological interpretations of the data. <br/><br/>Immersive research experiences, innovative detector laboratories, and partnerships with planetariums will bring UHECR science to formal and informal audiences. Research experiences developed in collaboration with programs focused on underrepresented groups, e.g. Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge, will enhance diversity at the graduate and undergraduate levels. UHECR science will reach broad and diverse audiences through partnerships with the Auger Visitors Center, the Malargue Planetarium, the Adler Planetarium and videos. The Adler collaboration will include the high-impact Astronomy Conversations program, where scientists interact directly with museum visitors, exploring Spanish language programming, and developing a full dome UHECR show."

The primary objective for the experiment using this detector is the search for new and exotic forms of matter. Regular matter is made from protons, neutrons and electrons. Many other types of particles are known, but some short-lived particles are predicted to exist from theoretical models of the theory of the strong force, called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). When high-energy photons strike a proton target, many particles are produced, and some of these may be the predicted exotic particles such as glueballs or hybrid mesons. <br/><br/>In the process of developing this instrumentation, physicists train students in the use of high-technology equipment and electronics. Some of these students go on to develop new uses of the technology, such as the diagnostic equipment used in many hospitals, including MRI, CAT and PET scanners.

The development of this equipment will train students with high technology skills that are needed in today's marketplace, while adding to our understanding of QCD."
0.261071,"Web-borne vibrations are the main source of many spiders' sensory information. Most famously, they inform spiders of the location of prey trapped in the web; web vibrations also carry signals from potential mates and alert spiders to the presence of their own predators. Some of these predators in turn exploit web vibrations to send misleading signals that trick spiders into ambushes or to ""hide"" their approach among other web disturbances. Understanding how web geometry and composition (webs are woven from several types of silk) affect transmission of these cues thus plays an important role in understanding spiders' behavior and ecology. Biologists have investigated these phenomena experimentally, for example, measuring web frequency responses resulting from different geometries. Much less attention has been directed to modeling web vibrations, despite the additional insight such models would provide. In the frequency response study, for instance, the experimenters were limited to working with natural webs or those with threads removed, and could not test the effects of arbitrarily altering thread patterns or types, which would be crucial for understanding web design. This project will fill this gap by exploring the design of spider webs through computational models for the vibration of string networks backed up by a new generation of experiments on biological and artificially-constructed webs. The key broader impact of the proposed work is making sophisticated modern vibration models available to biologists and others whose expertise is not in dynamical systems.

0.157616,"This grant supports the development of an instrument to produce dense, cold, gases of potassium atoms in highly excited quantum mechanical orbits (Rydberg states). The atomic gases will have temperatures less than a thousandth of a degree above absolute zero. In highly excited states the electrons are very far from the nucleus, and are highly susceptible to interactions with external electric fields and other atoms.<br/><br/>Because of their remarkable properties, highly-excited atoms have the potential to provide insights into the dynamics of an array of quantum mechanical systems. The simple properties of highly excited potassium atoms will allow experiments that elucidate fundamental quantum processes of interest in chemical quantum control and in quantum information science. The strong, long-range, and non-isotropic nature of the interactions between atoms and measurements of the dynamics of many-atom systems is connected to ongoing experiments in condensed matter physics that employ ultracold samples of atoms and molecules.<br/><br/>The experiments that will be enabled by the instrument will address two overriding questions. The first question is how simple quantum systems behave when driven by strong fields. The second question is how energy transfer between atoms and molecules can be assisted or frustrated by light while in the presence of complex many-body interactions. The unique instrument will allow transformative research at a small college through experiments that complement research done in other atomic and molecular species at other institutions worldwide.<br/><br/>Developing the instrument involves design and construction of three distinct components to be added to a working system that produces cold ground-state atoms. The main goals of the development project are the following: (1) stabilizing lasers for excitation of the potassium electrons; (2) developing and constructing a structure to apply controlled electric fields to the atoms; and (3) developing and constructing a detector that can determine the energy levels of the individual atoms in the apparatus. Specifically, the following components will be added to the PI's existing potassium magneto optical trap (MOT): (1) stabilized ultraviolet and infrared lasers for stepwise excitation of ultracold potassium atoms from the ground-state to Rydberg states via the intermediate 5p level; (2) a radiofrequency transmission line to apply fields to the atoms that are compatible with the ultra-high-vacuum MOT; and (3) a state-selective field-ionization detector that does not perturb the Rydberg states.<br/><br/>The project involves extensive student training. The project will impact the education of many undergraduate students at Colby College both through their direct participation in instrument development and in classes affected by the project. The PI has been effective at integrating undergraduate students of all levels into his research program. Undergraduates working on the development of the instrument will receive training in state-of-the-art atomic physics and expertise in lasers, electronics, optical instrumentation, vacuum and radiofrequency technology, and computerized data acquisition and control systems."
0.374383,"Atomic nuclei occurring in nature tend to have the same number of neutrons and protons. For larger nuclear masses, this is attributed to the symmetry energy, a contribution to the nuclear energy associated with neutron-proton imbalance, that becomes larger the larger the imbalance. Nuclei with large imbalance can decay to more energetically favored products and, when that imbalance is excessive, the nuclei cannot even be formed. Understanding the symmetry energy is essential for extrapolating from the properties of existing nuclei to neutron stars kept stable by gravity while at the verge of collapse to black holes. In their efforts, the inverstigators will rely on their complementary expertise and will benefit from the expertise in nuclear structure of other members of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) Nuclear Theory Group and from the expertise in nuclear astrophysics of the members of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA), housed partly at Michigan State University.<br/><br/>This project will advance our understanding of nuclear reactions, emphasizing aspects pertaining to the so-called nuclear symmetry energy. The symmetry energy governs average evolution of nuclear properties with neutron-proton imbalance that is now easier to vary experimentally given the modern existing and planned accelerators that can accelerate short-lived isotopes. The symmetry energy is important for extrapolating from the properties of the nuclei to those of neutron stars. The latter are macroscopic nuclear systems made stable, right at the verge of collapse into a black hole, by opposing forces of gravity and pressure tied to the dependence of symmetry energy on nuclear density. The symmetry energy at densities higher than normal for nuclei is studied using observables from central collisions of heavy nuclei, in particular charged pion ratios and collective flow. The investigators will improve on theoretical descriptions of those central collisions, by incorporating dynamic production of alpha particles into transport theory for the collisions. Because of large binding energy per nucleon and equal proton and neutron numbers, alpha particles are, on one hand, rather copiously produced and, on the other, they significantly change relative neutron-proton imbalance in their surroundings; hence their importance. The symmetry energy at normal and subnormal densities will be studied by simultaneously interpreting data from elastic scattering and charge exchange reactions, thus learning about differences in the neutron and proton distributions in those nuclei that have neutron-proton imbalance. Finally, the investigators will extract optical potentials of neutrons and protons from many-body theory relying on fundamental interactions, paying particular attention to the dependence of those potentials on neutron-proton imbalance. The fundamental extraction can help to reduce ambiguities in the interpretations of peripheral reaction experiments."
0.01409,"Nuclear Science is tasked with answering questions such as: (i) How did matter come into being and how does it evolve? (ii) How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge? (iii) How can the knowledge and technology progress provided by nuclear physics best be used to benefit society? Providing answers to these questions depends on a detailed theoretical understanding of nuclear reactions, a field in which current approaches are either outdated or limited to a small number of applications. In this larger context, this project will focus on the theoretical study of deuteron-induced reactions. Due to the short lifetimes involving exotic nuclei, direct neutron capture measurements of relevance to the origin of the heavy elements are often not possible. Indirect techniques like deuteron induced reactions are a common tool to extract the relevant astrophysical rates. These reactions are part of ongoing experimental programs at radioactive beam facilities, as well as programs at future facilities such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). As such, this project will provide theoretical support to challenging experimental programs and will provide a unique training opportunity for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.<br/><br/>A reliable reaction theory is critical for the understanding the data produced at experimental programs using (d,p) reactions. From a theoretical perspective, (d,p) reactions are attractive because the scattering can be reduced to an effective three-body problem. One of the most challenging aspects of solving the three-body problems for nuclear reactions is posed by the repulsive Coulomb interaction. While for light nuclei the momentum-space Faddeev equations can be treated by screening the Coulomb force, a similar approach is difficult to implement for heavy systems. Indeed, for most of the new exotic nuclei to be produced at FRIB, currently available computational methods are not adequate. This project will address this critical need and provide an implementation of an exact Faddeev method for the three-body nuclear reaction problem, in which the Coulomb force will be treated without screening."
0.21,"The dynamics of central nuclear collisions involves simultaneous and nontrivial interactions of many nuclear constituents. Such interactions are a challenge for nuclear theory and are important for studies of the physics of the early Universe. Unfortunately, current descriptions of nuclear collisions rely on the semiclassical limit of the dynamics. Overcoming previous technical difficulties in the numerical implementation of the quantal theory of nuclear reactions, in this project the investigator and his collaborators will develop new strategies for the numerical implementation of this many-body theory in one and two dimensions, before attacking the realistic three-dimensional case. The resulting upgrade in software infrastructure for nuclear collisions will support the experimental program at the future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams currently under construction on the Michigan State University campus. The computational methods developed in this project are likely to benefit research in other fields, such as studies of electron transport across nanoscale electronic devices in electrical engineering, and will train the postdoc and student involved in cutting-edge computational techniques.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop the computational framework for a quantal description of central nuclear collisions based on a nonequilibrium Green functions approach that is expected to open up the path towards a first-principles description of nuclear reactions. By following the quantal rather than the semiclassical evolution of many-body systems, the PI and his collaborators will reduce the level of uncertainty in the analysis of energetic collisions for the study of bulk nuclear properties, including the symmetry energy and the transport properties of matter. The successful completion of this project will provide useful tools for studies of head-on nuclear collisions and excitations of collective resonances, and will prepare the ground for future studies of collisions at finite impact parameter."
1.2,"The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) is the nation's premier facility to accelerate nuclei with the purpose of studying nuclear structure. NSCL has developed world-unique new experimental capabilities with reaccelerated rare-isotope beams, ensuring a continued leadership role in rare-isotope physics worldwide. With the recent expansion of research capabilities at NSCL, demand for these beams to be used in nuclear physics experiments has never been higher. The instrument proposed here, called a Helium-Jet Ion Gas System (HJ-IGS) will allow for commensal running of two experiments simultaneously, each using different detector systems at NSCL, which will expand the number of experiments and hence help to meet the demand for experiments that increase our understanding of nuclei.<br/><br/>Helium-Jet Ion Sources have been used for harvesting isotopes in the past, but the idea to use such a system to harvest some of the rarest isotopes available to researchers in a projectile fragmentation facility is novel. Rare isotopes that are bent out of the central beam path during the purification process of the primary rare-isotope beam are stopped and collected in a high-pressure cell filled with Helium saturated with aerosols to which the stopped isotopes will attach. With a high-pressure differential, the collected isotopes are quickly transported through a 40 meter-long capillary to an ion source that injects the isotopes, after purification, into a beam line that can feed one of several stations not used in the primary experiment. This allows two experiments to be performed at the same time: an experiment using a fast rare isotope beam directly produced in projectile fragmentation and an experiment with stopped or reaccelerated beams using the harvested, transported, ionized and purified isotopes in the HJ-IGS. State-of-the-art experiments that are in high demand in the fields of nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics, as well as fundamental interactions and symmetries, and include such diverse techniques as high-precision mass measurements in atom traps, in-beam laser spectroscopy and polarization, nuclear decay spectroscopy, and low-energy reaction studies with an active-target time projection chamber."
0.585564,"High-precision Penning trap mass spectrometers have been developed at several rare-isotope facilities around the world due to the extraordinary precision and accuracy that has been demonstrated in determining a fundamental property of a nucleus, its mass. Penning trap mass spectrometers determine the mass of a charged particle via a measurement of its cyclotron frequency in a strong magnetic field. At present, Penning trap mass spectrometers for rare isotopes employ a time-of-flight ion cyclotron resonance (TOF-ICR) detection scheme which is universal but typically requires at minimum rate of rare isotope ions of at least a few ions per hour. In order to overcome this sensitivity limit the group will develop, build, and install a dedicated Single Ion Penning Trap Spectrometer (SIPT) mass spectrometer using a 6 Tesla magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid and employing the narrowband Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) method. The technique will be optimized for the study of very rare isotopes provided only at very low rates, one per day or week, a rate that prohibits the use of the TOF-ICR technique. The narrowband FT-ICR method uses a tuned, superconducting circuit to amplify the signal generated by a single charged particle on the electrodes of the Penning trap as it moves around inside the trap. By performing a Fourier analysis on the amplified signal, the cyclotron frequency can be determined. As narrowband FT-ICR is not as universal as TOF-ICR, it is best used on candidates with extremely low delivery rates and of great scientific interest.<br/><br/>The proposed SIPT mass spectrometer will have a broad significance and importance by improving our ability to determine the mass of rare isotopes with unusual ratios of the number of neutrons and protons, much different from those found in stable isotopes, as they exist on Earth. The determination of the masses of such exotic and often very short-lived rare isotopes is of utmost importance since it provides direct information on how tightly the neutrons and protons are bound in the atomic nucleus. Masses of rare isotopes serve as input data in a variety of fields of science, such as nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. For example, rare isotopes are produced in abundance in stellar environments and play a key role in the star's evolution but the production on earth in rare isotope beam facilities is very challenging, and for many important isotopes the beam rates are very low. SIPT's highly sensitive technique will be capable of making a mass measurement with only a single rare isotope ion, pushing the frontier of precision mass measurements of rare isotopes to more exotic isotopes. The development of this technology will also be of benefit for future use at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). We believe that the interdisciplinary nature of the SIPT project is well suited for attracting and educating students from underrepresented groups, resulting in a stronger research program and greater cultural awareness for everyone involved."
0.63392,"All of the matter on Earth is composed primarily of stable or long-lived isotopes created in a stellar explosion billions of years ago. However, the isotopes we observe here on Earth comprise only a small fraction of those that are known to exist. Study of short-lived, or rare, isotopes is key to understanding the origin of matter in the universe, how neutrons and protons collectively form into atomic nuclei, and to explore fundamental symmetries of nature. As these rare isotopes are not naturally occurring on Earth, they must be created in powerful particle accelerators, such those at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), located on the campus of Michigan State University (MSU). There beams of rare isotopes are created at half the speed of light. However, some of the most precise experimental techniques for probing the properties of rare isotopes require beams with energies up to a billion times less than what they are created with at NSCL. These high-energy beams can be slowed using solid degraders and brought to rest in a chamber filled with a buffer gas, a technique currently in use at the NSCL. The development of a next-generation Advanced Cryogenic Gas Stopper (ACGS) will improve the efficiency and speed at which rare isotopes are delivered to experiments, expanding the reach of several experimental programs to even more exotic isotopes. It will benefit the user community of the NSF-funded NSCL and, through the scientific progress it enables, society at large. The project will follow NSCL and MSU policies for ensuring a diverse scientific workforce. A state-of-the-art development project like ACGS, with close ties to a leading research university that actively encourages and supports a multicultural research body, will create an optimal environment for under-represented and minority students to be trained as scientists.<br/><br/>The ACGS is a next-generation high-performance linear gas-stopping device for converting fast rare isotope beams into stopped beams that can be used directly or reaccelerated. The delivery of rare-isotope beams over a wide range of energies is necessary to maximize the number of experimental techniques that can be employed. Beams with energies of 0.01 to 100 keV are used in high-precision experiments with ion traps and lasers, to measure nuclear binding energies (masses), to determine nuclear radii and moments, and to test fundamental symmetries at levels complementing much more expensive high-energy experiments. Precision beams of rare isotopes with energies of 0.1 to 20 MeV/u are used to measure cross sections of key reactions that are critical for understanding nuclear synthesis in the cosmos and for nuclear reaction studies that help determine detailed nuclear properties needed for further advances in nuclear theory. After installation at the NSCL, the ACGS will provide high-purity beams with high efficiency, with short extraction times to provide access to short-lived isotopes, and with a high beam rate capability to enable world-class science, in particular with reaccelerated beams. Fast beams provided by NSCL's Coupled Cyclotron Facility will be slowed down in solid degraders prior to being stopped in helium gas inside the ACGS. The thermalized ions are then guided to an extraction orifice using RF ion transport techniques and a low-energy, so called ""stopped"" beam is formed. The design is tailored to allow the ACGS to accept incident beam rates exceeding 10^8/s. A novel electrode design, compared to existing linear gas stoppers, will provide an order of magnitude higher beam rate capability and cryogenic operation guarantees delivery of clean rare isotope beams. The use of novel RF-carpet ion-transport techniques will provide extraction times as short as ten milliseconds. The ACGS is best suited for the stopping of medium-to-heavy-mass isotopes that have relatively narrow range straggling distributions in the helium gas and will constitute a high-performance complement to the light-ion Cyclotron Stopper already being built at the NSCL. The availability of intense stopped and reaccelerated beams of short-lived isotopes will play a critical role in the future research program at the NSCL and will be a key feature of research at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) under construction at MSU."
0.13,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Jeffrey Harvey at the University of Chicago.<br/><br/>With the recent discovery of the long-sought Higgs boson, the theoretical framework underlying particle physics (the so-called ""Standard Model"" of particle physics) is now complete. However, there are still many important outstanding questions involving the fundamental structure of matter and energy and their interactions. These include what sorts of mathematical structures are needed to combine gravity and quantum mechanics, as well as the origin of dark matter and dark energy. String theory provides one possible framework to address these questions. Professor Harvey will pursue two independent lines of research aimed at addressing these questions. The first part of this project involves the study of ""Little String Theory"" - a theory that has some of the same good features of string theory but is easier to analyze. The second part of this project involves research in an area of pure mathematics that has close ties to techniques that grew out of string theory. This project thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. This project will also have significant broader impacts. The research will involve postdocs, graduate students and even at times undergraduate students, thus providing critical training for the next generation of physicists as they start research. The PI will also lecture at international schools and workshops and also participate in public outreach events in the Chicago area.<br/><br/>More technically, the PI will extend recent work on counting BPS states in Little String Theory to the study of more general backgrounds with N=2 supersymmetry. He will also continue his study of non-compact Conformal Field Theories and their connection to mock modular forms. This work has implications for the study of BPS states in supersymmetric field theories and to the study of string theory in a variety of physically interesting settings. A third component of this project involves the mathematics of some still-mysterious connections between sporadic groups and various types of modular and mock modular forms. In particular he will extend work currently in progress by extending techniques of Vertex Operator Algebras."
4.51,"This award provides three-year continued support for the experimental particle physics and astroparticle physics programs at Michigan State University. The intellectual merit deals with the completion of the final chapter of the 1967 Standard Model and its necessary evolution through physics studies at D0 and CDF at the Tevatron at Fermilab, ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the NuMI Off-axis neutrino Appearance (NOvA) experiment at Fermilab and Ash River, MN, and the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) experiment at the Gamma Ray Observatory at the Sierra Negra in Mexico. The primary research focus is new experiments: ATLAS, HAWC, and NOvA with a selective physics program at D0 and CDF to the completion of the Tevatron program. The broader impacts of this work include the opportunity to bring these front-line research questions into classrooms and to the public at large through lectures and interactive video presentations. In addition, the group engages more than a dozen graduate students and a number of undergraduates into the labs at MSU, Fermilab, and CERN providing unique experiences for students who are often not physics majors."
0.195008,"Significant advancements in 21st century physics have relied on the discovery that properties of atoms are not fixed, but can be changed by interactions with laser light. The ability to understand and control these sensitive interactions is also the key to the creation of new atom-light based technologies. Some atom-light interactions are sensitive to the surrounding magnetic field. As an example, an atom is extremely selective about the precise colors of light it absorbs, but when it is placed in a magnetic field, the atom's color choices will shift depending on the strength of the field. Such interactions can be used as the foundation of a device, called an ""atomic magnetometer,"" that can measure unknown magnetic fields. This investigation studies interactions between laser light and a specially prepared gas of atoms that is sensitive to small variations in the surrounding magnetic field. The special preparation uses two lasers and a controlled magnetic field to temporarily but dramatically change how laser light travels through a gas of atoms. As a result, the laser light's brightness fluctuates, or flickers, in ways that are not yet fully understood. These fluctuations not only carry information about the atoms, but they are also especially sensitive to magnetic field variations. This research will further our scientific understanding of atom-light interactions, which is of broad interest for many technological applications. Simultaneously, the research will produce new techniques for detecting small, unknown magnetic fields, like the magnetic fields emitted from the human heart. The new detection methods will potentially impact a broad range of medical and scientific fields, and because they make use of low-cost and potentially portable laser systems, any resulting technological applications will be widely accessible and suitable for use outside of the laboratory environment. Undergraduate students will be involved at all stages of this research agenda, preparing them for careers in research science and other STEM-related fields. <br/><br/>Light intensity fluctuations derived from atomic coherence can encode valuable information about coherence dynamics in an atomic vapor. Furthermore, they provide a platform for a new class of compact and simple atomic magnetometers. This research agenda uses low-cost, free-running diode lasers with inherent frequency noise that is converted into information-rich intensity noise near an atomic resonance. The amplitude and phase of the intensity fluctuations are particularly sensitive to small magnetic field variations near an atomic coherence between Zeeman sublevels. Hanle effect Electromagnetically Induced Transparency will be induced in rubidium vapor and used to prototype and optimize a novel magnetometry technique relying on coherence-derived light fluctuations. The converted laser intensity noise will be studied using self-correlations and spectrum analysis. The findings will deepen our understanding of the relationship between the light fluctuations and the underlying atomic coherence, as well as give us the tools to build a new atomic magnetometer. Moreover, the results will provide useful insight for mitigating noise from imperfect lasers."
0.48,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Jon Pumplin, Daniel Stump and C.-P. Yuan at the Michigan State University (MSU).<br/><br/>Support for this project will contribute to understanding the fundamental nature of the physical universe--the particles that comprise it and their interactions--as revealed by experiments in high energy physics. Current understanding of high energy physics is embodied in the Standard Model (SM). Protons and neutrons, and all other strongly interacting particles, are composed of fundamental particles called partons (quarks and gluons). Interactions between the partons are described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The proposed research involves the interplay between QCD theory and experimental data from many experiments, including recent experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This global analysis of data is necessary to deepen the understanding of QCD, and to determine the probability distributions of the partons in the proton. By understanding these distributions, it is possible to take interactions of protons with protons (which is what happens at the LHC) and determine the underlying quark-quark, quark-gluon and gluon-gluon interactions. This is essential for determining the underlying physics of the process, and was necessary for extracting, for example, the Higgs boson signal. These probability distributions are called ""CTEQ Parton Distribution Functions"", where CTEQ means ""Coordinated Theoretical-Experiment Project of QCD"". The project trains graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in theoretical high energy physics at MSU and at CTEQ summer schools. It also provides opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in forefront research through the REU program, and for high school teachers and middle school students to experience physics through summer programs sponsored by MSU and the State of Michigan.<br/><br/>As noted, the resulting CTEQ Parton Distribution Functions have been essential to the interpretation of experiments at the world's leading high energy collider facilities: Fermilab (Batavia, IL), RHIC (Brookhaven, NY), DESY (Hamburg, Germany), and CERN (Geneva, Switzerland). Although the colliders at Fermilab and DESY have been turned off, data from those facilities are still important; in particular, final data from HERA run II are still to be incorporated in the present analysis when they become available. The proposed research will continue the PIs' world-leading contributions to lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collider phenomenology. Complementary to the research on QCD, the group will also study the Electroweak (EW) sector of the SM, which is extremely successful in explaining and predicting experimental data spanning a range in energy from the atomic scale to the Z boson and top quark masses. Measurements of W, Z, top quark pair, single top quark and Higgs boson productions at the LHC, including both inclusive rates and relevant kinematical distributions, will provide major new input to the understanding of parton distributions during the next few years. At the same time, refinements of the parton distributions are necessary for progress in the EW sector, both for testing the SM in greater precision and for probing New Physics effects in high energy colliders."
0.4,"Nuclear physics plays a key role in our quest to understand the Universe, addressing fundamental scientific questions like: 1) How did matter come into being and how does it evolve? 2) How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge? 3) Are the fundamental interactions that are basic to the structure of matter fully understood?, and 4) How can the knowledge and technological progress provided by nuclear physics best be used to benefit society? In recent years, researchers have made remarkable progress in our fundamental understanding of the complex and fascinating system that is the nucleus. This progress has been driven by new theoretical insights and increased computational power, as well as by experimental access to new isotopes with a large excess of neutrons or protons. The latter involves large societal investments in scientific forefront experimental facilities like the Facility of Radioactive Ion Beams, which is being built at Michigan State University in the U.S.A. The mentoring of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows is an integral part of the project. Their professional development toward independence as original and productive scientists is a central objective of the project and will continue to prepare them for industry or academic institutions.<br/><br/>While much has been learned so far about nuclear systems and associated phenomena, much remains to be understood. This project aims to advance our basic understanding of subatomic matter by addressing many of the above fundamental questions. For nuclear theorists, the challenge is to develop a comprehensive and unified description of nuclei and their reactions, grounded in the fundamental interactions between the constituent nucleons with quantifiable uncertainties to maximize predictive power. To model such systems according to the laws of motion and the underlying nuclear forces, requires the development of sophisticated physical and mathematical algorithms. To address this challenge, this group will develop a toolbox of methods for dealing with many strongly-interacting particles (protons and neutrons) capable of treating a wide variety of nuclear systems, ranging from stable closed-shell nuclei and nuclear matter as seen in for example neutron stars to exotic loosely-bound neutron and proton rich nuclei far from shell closures. The toolbox will make use of state-of-the-art microscopic inputs and will be built around modern many-particle methods. A premium will be placed on developing reliable theoretical error bars, which stem in part from truncation errors used to derive nuclear forces, uncertainties in the fitted parameters of the input interactions, truncated approximations intended to ""soften"" the input Hamiltonian, basis-set truncation errors, and truncation errors in the particular level of many-body approximation. By developing powerful many-body methods capable of treating a wide range of nuclear systems with controlled uncertainties, this project will bring us one step closer to being able to answer the above fundamental questions of nuclear physics."
4.574,"Much remains unknown about the origin and evolution of the elements that comprise the universe beyond those created in the Big Bang. Making significant advances in these areas requires investigations at the intersection of nuclear physics and astrophysics. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers (PFC) award the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics - Center for the Evolution of the Elements (JINA-CEE) will focus on answering closely connected open questions related to the origin of the elements and the properties of dense matter probed by neutron stars. JINA-CEE will build on the expertise and technical developments from its past two PFC awards and use innovative laboratory experiments, combined with theoretical and computational approaches, to address the broad range of nuclear physics and astrophysics challenges underlying these science goals. The resulting insights will be integrated into comprehensive physics models of element creation and neutron stars that are then compared to existing and new observational data. JINA-CEE will continue to have educational and research impacts within the nuclear astrophysics community through its interdisciplinary workshop, school, and visitor programs. In addition it will create new multi-institutional graduate course modules and undergraduate course components while reaching out to K-12 students, teachers, and the general public.<br/><br/>The transition from a three element (hydrogen, helium, and lithium) universe, with a small number of isotopes, to a chemically diverse cosmos containing eighty-two long-lived elements with hundreds of isotopes, is significant and not well understood. Neutron star matter plays an important role for the origin of the elements, as it shapes the synthesis of many of the heavy elements in nature produced in core-collapse supernovae and in neutron star mergers. JINA-CEE will explore two closely interrelated questions through experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches: ""How were the elements beyond hydrogen and helium created during the first billion years after the Big Bang?"" and ""What are the properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter and how can it be probed by observations of neutron stars?"""
0.06,"The research supported by this award will probe the limits of our understanding of the weak interaction, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Among other things, the weak interaction is responsible for the type of radioactive decay called beta decay in which a nucleus is transformed into a different nucleus with the emission of an electron and a neutrino. The award will allow the two scientists to carry out experiments in which they precisely measure the energy of electrons emitted in four different nuclear beta decays. Three of these experiments will test key aspects of the Standard Model of the electroweak interaction, which is the theory that describes the unification of two of the fundamental forces, the weak interaction and the electromagnetic interaction. These precision beta decay measurements are complementary to particle collider experiments in the search for new physics. A fourth proposed experiment aims to resolve uncertainties in the beta decay of potassium-40, an important tool in geochronology. The research program has the further goal and benefit of training highly talented undergraduate physics students. Students involved will gain experience with state-of-the-art software and experimental techniques, and will learn to think independently and gain a variety of practical problem solving skills. The broader impact is felt when these students enter the workforce in STEM fields or in teaching. <br/><br/>The research program consists of several experiments involving the high precision measurement of the shapes of beta spectra. In two of the proposed experiments the goal is to provide a strong test of the Conserved Vector Current hypothesis in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model of particle physics. In a third experiment, the goal is to improve limits on non-Standard-Model contributions (Fierz terms) to the description of the weak interaction. A fourth experiment has the goal of resolving an uncertainty in the potassium-40 beta spectrum, which is relevant to applications in geochronology. Specifically, the carbon-14 beta spectrum will be measured using a new magnetic spectrometer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This spectrometer will be nearly identical in form to the superconducting spectrometer used to make the same measurement in oxygen-14, enabling reduced uncertainties arising from higher order matrix element contributions. Measurements in fluorine-20 and helium-6 will be carried out at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory using implantation into a scintillator detector, which will have significantly different systematic effects from the magnetic spectrometer measurements and will be important in achieving low thresholds. A fourth experiment has the goal of measuring the shape of the potassium-40 beta spectrum. Knowledge of this spectrum shape is important for a standard technique in radioactive dating of geologic samples, but a recent report suggests the shape may not be as well understood as had been thought. An important aspect of all these measurements is in assessing and correcting for systematic effects through measurement and computational modeling."
0.045079,"The neutrons and protons that make up the nucleus of every atom are themselves made up of constituent particles called quarks and gluons, and held together by what we call the strong nuclear force. This award supports research to the study of the strong interactions between those elementary constituents of matter. More specifically, it is aimed at understanding the properties of the theory of the strong force, named Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD, at energies where nucleons are formed and it is most relevant,. To this end, the PI and the students supported by this award will perform experiments at The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab,) in Newport News, VA. NSU faculty and undergraduate students will participate in the construction of hardware and in the analysis of data from experiments in the forefront of intermediate energy nuclear physics. Norfolk State University is one of the leading Historically Black Colleges and Universities. NSU graduates more African-American physics majors than all of the other Virginia universities combined. It is a goal of this project to strengthen the national participation of undergraduate minorities in nuclear and particle physics research.<br/><br/>In the recent years, numerical solutions of QCD (Lattice-QCD) have provided with a mass spectrum of light-mass mesons. Therefore, it is time for improving our experimental determination of the poorly known light-mass meson spectrum to compare with predictions. Since the interaction carrier of the strong interaction, the gluon, is sensitive to the strong interaction, it is also possible that gluons can be externally observable in the meson spectrum as exotic mesons (particles made of a quark, an antiquark and a gluon). One main question in meson spectroscopy is: Can we find hints of the gluon in the meson spectrum? The PI is analyzing data from meson spectroscopy experiments performed with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) in Jefferson Lab's Hall B to search for those hints. He is also involved in two new experiments named GlueX and CLAS12, at the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV upgrade. Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) is the technique used for that analysis. The first PWA results have been published and more PWA results are progressing in several channels. The main work is in developing and upgrading new techniques of amplitude and partial wave analysis."
0.087576,"The use of beams of light, like laser beams, has been transformative in the development of modern technologies, from telephone communications where information is encoded in the light traveling through fibers, to laser surgery where high light intensity is delivered to small areas of tissue. These technologies exploit light's color or energy. Yet another property of light is its polarization, which is invisible to the unaided eye, but seen indirectly, for example, through the visual effects of some types of 3D movies or in polarizing sunglasses. This research will involve preparing light beams with polarization that varies from point to point across the beam, like in an image. This polarization will be encoded onto individual photons (the ""particles"" of light). Photons can carry a lot of information while at the same time being quantum, or whole. Technologies that harness the quantum aspects of light and matter have the potential to upgrade current communication technologies to ones with substantially increased speed and capacity. Polarization also holds promise as a tool to manipulate molecules that are chiral, or corkscrew-like. This encompasses most organic molecules, including DNA (the double helix). This research will test recent theories which predict that the polarization of light can be used to segregate chiral molecules into those that spiral clockwise or counterclockwise when viewed from a particular end (DNA always spirals one way but not the other, for example). This is an important step in the synthesis of medicines because molecules that spiral one way could cure while those that spiral the other way could cause harm. This research will involve undergraduates, introducing them to the scientific process while training them in modern photonic technologies. <br/><br/>States of light that have spatially variable polarization are similar to entangled quantum states in that both are non-separable. Thus, space-variant-polarization states are well suited for use in quantum information. They add higher dimensions to the quantum states of photons in the following ways: they entail non-separable superpositions of polarization (in two dimensions) and transverse spatial modes of light (in principle, adding an infinite number of additional dimensions). Thus, spatial modes add a higher dimensionality to the space in which to encode quantum information onto single photons. We have developed techniques that encode and decode these states, which due to their space-variant polarization can be diagnosed by imaging techniques. This research will investigate the space of photon pairs entangled in polarization and spatial modes and the nonlocal space-variant polarization images that those states will encode. In parallel, intense beams carrying space-variant polarization will be used to investigate a predicted but yet unconfirmed new light force, which affects chiral molecules in such a way that it segregates the molecules by their handedness. That is, the light creates a field gradient that applies a force that is of opposite sign for right and left handed chiralities. This new force, fundamentally related to optical activity, could be of importance in the chemical synthesis of complex organic molecules, where it is desirable to separate one chirality from the other."
0.5112,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics with profound implications for our view of the Universe. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The identification of Dark Matter (DM) poses a challenge that is being addressed with a variety of complementary approaches and technologies. The direct search for DM with the XENON project at the Gran Sasso laboratory promises an extremely cost-efficient approach to cover vast regions of expected DM parameter space. This award will enable the US groups in XENON to participate in the operations and data analysis of XENON100 well into 2015 when the start of the scientific program with XENON1T is expected. With a strong presence at Gran Sasso, the US groups will maintain a leading role in the commissioning and operation of XENON1T. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>A number of students as well as post-doctoral researchers are involved in the XENON project at universities across the US.

0.407989,"Gases of atoms cooled to the ultra-low temperatures of 100 billionths of a degree above absolute zero have emerged as a highly versatile platform for the study of collective many-body behavior (the physics of how a collection of objects behaves in ways that is different from what one would expect from knowledge of how the objects behave individually). Such collective phenomena are usually associated with electrons in solid matter, where details about the crystal structure, strong interactions between electrons, and the underlying theory in physics which describes the system (quantum mechanics) can combine to create materials with highly unusual and sometimes very practical properties. The best known examples of such materials are high-temperature superconductors, in which electron currents flow without any resistance. Surprisingly, nearly 30 years after their discovery, physicists still do not understand the underlying mechanisms that create high-temperature superconductors; nor do they know if there is an upper bound on the superconducting temperature. Experiments with ultra-cold atoms on a so-called ""optical lattice"" created with light waves may help solve this mystery, thereby facilitating the development of practical applications of high temperature superconductors, including the efficient transmission of electrical energy and more cost-effective medical imaging. In this experiment, lithium atoms, which obey the same basic laws of physics as electrons, will act as stand-ins for the electrons in real materials. The atomic system is much cleaner than the real material, since there are no impurities, defects, or lattice dislocations. Furthermore, the parameters of the atomic system, including the atom-atom interaction strength, density, and the lattice parameters, are highly tunable. Ultra-cold lithium atoms will be used to create the most promising model and determine whether or not it contains the essence of superconductivity. <br/><br/>The group will exploit the broad Feshbach resonances in the lithium isotopes, the fermion Li-6 and the boson Li-7, to explore many-body physics, in and out of lattices, in contexts that have both fundamental and practical implications. Realization of the full potential of ultracold atoms in optical lattices has been impeded by an inability to cool to sufficiently low temperatures. The group has recently demonstrated a method to evaporatively cool in optical lattices which resulted in the observation of antiferromagnetic correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model, an archetypal model of condensed matter physics and the most prominent model of high-temperature superconductivity. Even lower temperatures are needed to explore the most novel strongly correlated phenomena. The group proposes to refine the cooling method, using Bragg scattering from magnetic correlations as a sensitive in-situ thermometer. With this system, the group plans to study the phase diagram of the Hubbard model for both repulsive and attractive interactions. Theory suggests that an attractive interaction combined with spin polarization (population imbalance) offers an exciting opportunity to observe the exotic FFLO pairing mechanism. Finally, for the bosonic isotope, the group will conduct a fundamental investigation of matter-wave tunneling for non-interacting and interacting Bose condensates to explore the role of the nonlinearity, including the regime of solitons. The barrier forms a beam splitter, which in a one-dimensional geometry constitutes a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Its coherence properties and hence, its suitability as a matter-wave interferometer, will be explored."

As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. In conjunction with this effort, the PI's will also teach a special-topics course on effective field theories and precision physics. Both are topics that are often neglected in typical particle-physics textbooks. <br/><br/>More technically, the research program can be divided into three main parts: (1) The development of calculational techniques for three-loop corrections to electroweak precision observables, and the integration of existing and new theoretical results for these observables into a flexible, object-oriented computer program; (2) The application of effective field theories, in particular Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, to unresolved questions at hadron colliders, such as processes involving jets, quarkonium production, and low-x physics; and (3) A comprehensive study of the use of effective field theories for new physics in Higgs, electroweak and flavor physics, with a focus on investigating correlations between operators, the role of different mass scales in the new-physics sector, and complications that arise in models of dark matter. This research plan is guided by ongoing and planned experimental high-energy physics efforts, and results will be made available to the experimental community in a suitable form."
0.100038,"Einstein's Theory of General Relativity predicts that the motion of massive astronomical bodies such as black holes or supernovae will generate tiny changes in the curvature of space called gravitational waves. Experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) are designed to detect these waves by measuring the length difference between two paths with laser light. The optics in these experiments are suspended in vacuum to isolate them from all forms of vibration. With no air to conduct it away, excess surface charge can build up on the optics over time. The motion of this charge changes the surrounding electric field, vibrating the optic and degrading the sensitivity of the experiment. The group at Trinity University has been measuring the rate at which surface charge builds up and a method of removing the charge that does not harm the delicate reflective coatings on the optics. Funding from this grant supports the completion of a charge removal system for delivery to the LIGO observatories and the study of the effect of different optical cleaning and handling techniques on the mobility of surface charge, and even the individual charge motions themselves. Pursuing this research will help improve the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and future gravitational-wave detectors, for which surface charge has been a known limiting noise source since 2006. The funding supports undergraduate research at Trinity University, where students can gain valuable experience working locally on a scaled-down vacuum system prototype while contributing to the overall LIGO research effort.<br/><br/>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is most sensitive to gravitational waves at signal frequencies near 100 Hz. A limiting noise source at these frequencies is surface charge on test masses, the motion of which generates fluctuating electric fields that vibrate the masses. The noise contribution depends on the charge magnitude and the correlation time for charge motion. This project tackles three issues related to charging noise. One is to finalize a deliverable discharging system and assist with its installation at the LIGO observatories. Prototype systems using ionized nitrogen gas have been demonstrated at both MIT and Trinity University, but it still must be verified that the process does not damage the test mass reflective coating. This is done by acquiring a test mass of known absorption, exposing it to an ionized nitrogen system, and then having its absorption retested (this process has been used in cooperation with Stanford University for previous discharging techniques). The second is to characterize the relaxation time constant and charging/discharging rate for Advanced LIGO test masses using different cleaning and handling techniques, to determine which methods will reduce charging noise. This requires obtaining several LIGO test mass witness samples, applying different cleaning techniques (methanol, liquinox, First Contact, etc.) to each, moving them into a vacuum system, charging with a high-voltage electrode pattern, and then using a Kelvin probe to measure the rate at which the deposited charge dissipates across the face of the test mass. This methodology will also be applied to proposed optical coatings and substrates for third-generation interferometers in cooperation with the Optics Working Group of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. The third is to modify an existing atomic force microscope at Trinity University so that it can perform Kelvin probe microscopy. This will make it possible tovisualize individual charge ""hopping"" across an insulating surface, with the goal of refining the Markov process model of low frequency noise contributions."
1.800627,"Scientific data is being collected at a higher rate than ever. A striking example is in elementary particle physics (EPP) experiments, where collaborations of thousands of scientists collect huge amounts of data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), but other disciplines have and are continuing to observe similar growth. <br/><br/>The complexity and time frame of these experiments is such that the full scientific potential can only be realized when the data remains accessible and analyzable through extended periods. <br/><br/>The possibility of successfully meeting this goal for the necessary long term data preservation requires a novel approach that will make the data and necessary software management more solid and survivable. The long term data preservation will become an even more critical issue as present experimental efforts evolve and the Big Data paradigm develops. The initial efforts of the US community to analyze the large volume of LHC data is being satisfied by the Open Science Grid project, designed to facilitate such large and distributed experiments. DASPOS provides an opportunity to continue to study today's analysis over the long term. <br/><br/>The DASPOS project incorporates the present state-of-the-art knowledge in working with data in EPP. This project aims to provide a generic technological framework where the basic difficulties are identified and solved with the aim of advancing these goals simultaneously for several disciplines, which should facilitate the emergence of commonalities and standards.<br/><br/>The milestones and the work plan are well structured and adapted to present knowledge. Intense communications via workshops is planned and is a natural path for the goal of inclusion of the various disciplines. The intention to document these workshops is a valuable component of this project, as are concrete goals such as prototypes and software challenges.<br/><br/>The DASPOS project is not only sound but also timely. The recent dynamics in data preservation and large data management is now reaching several countries and funding agencies. In fact, several projects at national levels are now installed, including for instance, the PREDON project, financed by CNRS-France in 2012 to prepare a multidisciplinary novel approach to big data management. <br/><br/>Other similar initiatives are under study in Germany and Italy. It is no question that synergies will emerge at an international scale, and is also clear that DASPOS will play a pioneering and leading role in this context. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the impact and merit of the DASPOS proposal is innovative and potentially transformational. This can be an historical opportunity to make a significant advance in the scientific data management in the context of the ""Big Data"" challenge."
0.165001,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Ikaros Bigi, Antonio Delgado, and Adam Martin at the University of Notre Dame.<br/><br/>After the successful discovery of the Higgs particle, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has just resumed taking data. This new data is likely to show the need to modify our current Standard Model of particle physics in order to accommodate new particles and perhaps even new interactions. Professors Bigi, Delgado, and Martin propose to analyze this possibility within the framework of exotic models such as supersymmetry, strongly coupled Higgs sectors, and extra spacetime dimensions. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts, as the PI's will engage in the teaching of physics at the undergraduate and graduate level, lecturing at graduate physics summer schools and organizing workshops and conferences around the world, and teaching particle physics to high-school teachers and students through QuarkNet, both nationally and internationally.<br/><br/>More technically, a careful study of how the new data can be accommodated into models of new physics will be performed. Simulations of collider data will be run to see if any excesses reported by the LHC can be explained in one particular model. Professors Delgado and Martin will try to implement new search strategies for situations where standard techniques fail to discover new physics. Professor Bigi will pay special attention into the implications of new physics on processes that lead to violations of flavor. Such situations are very rare in the Standard Model but nonetheless can provide a smoking gun for new models of particle physics."
0.105,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Ronen Plesser of Duke University.<br/><br/>String theory is the leading contender for a quantum theory of gravity and a unified description of the fundamental structure of the universe. Research in string theory in the past three decades has led to exciting new insights in physics and mathematics. Considering string propagation in nontrivial backgrounds produces physical interpretations for mathematical structures in spacetime. The interplay between mathematical and physical intuitions and techniques has enriched both fields. A notable example of this is the discovery and the many applications of mirror symmetry, a surprising relation between two distinct spaces that lead to indentical physics when used as string backgrounds. Plesser's research will build on these results and on recent progress in both fields to pursue these studies in new regimes. This work will be done in collaboration with physicists and mathematicians around the world, enhancing interdisciplinary cooperation. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in a particularly interdisciplinary direction. Plesser will also train graduate students and involve undergraduate students in the research. Plesser will also collaborate with local public schools to enhance science teaching and generate enthusiasm for science in young people through visits to the classroom to present specific curriculum materials developed in concert with the schools. These curriculum materials are made broadly available for use elsewhere. Moreover, the regular public stargazing events conducted by Plesser for the past decade will be enhanced by including astrophotography capabilities.<br/><br/>More technically, Plesser will pursue various approaches to better understand the structure of the moduli space of string vacua with four unbroken supersymmetries. This includes perturbative heterotic vacua and the (0,2) superconformal field theories associated to these, as well as F-theory and M-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Each of these formulations gives a simple description of a region of the moduli space, and the relation between the two descriptions in regions of overlap is of particular interest."

The union of gravity and quantum mechanics has fundamental problems to be addressed, and the connection of fundamental physics to cosmology will allow crucial tests of our present ideas. Professors Donoghue and Sorbo will conduct a research program which addresses these new frontiers. Professor Donoghue will use the techniques of what is called ""effective field theory"" to study quantum-gravity effects that are reliably calculated at low energy. Professor Sorbo's primary research involves novel effects in the study of the universe, including possible new ways of testing proposed new theories. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of the universe and its fundamental properties. Professors Donoghue and Sorbo will also involve graduate students and postdocs in their research, and thereby provide training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. They will provide outreach to high-school students and teachers, and develop a new book promoting the understanding of quantum field theory. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Donoghue will use effective field theory to treat quantum problems in general relativity in the region where the effective field theory is valid. He will also conduct research at the frontiers of understanding in Soft Collinear Effective Theory, Asymptotic Safety, and nuclear binding. Professor Sorbo will explore various phenomenological aspects of primordial inflation, with a special emphasis on the possible explanations of the anomalies observed in the CMB spectra. He will also investigate the gravitational couplings of axion dark matter, the behavior of four-form fields coupled to moduli, and various aspects of massive gravity."
0.1,"from PI, not yet edited:<br/><br/>This award funds the research activities of Professors Matias Zaldarriaga at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. <br/><br/>Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background allow us to directly image regions of our Universe as they were only three hundred and eighty thousand years after the Big Bang. Recent observations have shown that the structures that we see at that time originated even before the hot big bang phase in the history of our Universe, a tiny fraction of a second after the Bang. These structures are the earliest fossils we have from our Universe's history. A wide array of new observations are underway to better characterize these structures to try to learn more about the earliest history of our Universe. This proposal will explore theoretical models for the period during which the structures originates as well as for the later history of our Universe. Both studies are needed to interpret these upcoming observations. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Zaldarriaga will involve postdoctoral students in this research which will contribute to their training at a critical stage in their career. Professor Zaldarriaga will continue to give public lectures and organize a course for senior citizens in the local senior community center. <br/><br/>More technically, Professors Zaldarriaga will study new mechanisms for generating gravitational waves and non-Gaussianities in the scalar seeds during an inflationary period. He will work on the so-called consistency conditions applicable both during the early Universe and to the later development of structure. Professor Zaldarriaga will also study the theory behind additional probes of both the Early Universe, such as spectral distortions in the CMB and the properties of the dark matter, such as upcoming measurements of substructure as traced by gravitational lensing."
0.61,"Electrons have the fundamental property of ""spin,"" which is analogous to that of a spinning toy top, and is associated with their angular momentum. This project studies collisions between polarized electrons, which have their spins aligned in one direction, and so-called ""chiral"", or ""handed"" molecules (such molecules, of which DNA is an example, are characterized by a spiral, or helical geometry). These experiments address physics questions about the dynamics of electron-chiral molecule scattering, particularly with regard to the role played by the electron spins. They will also provide important clues about the origins of biological homochirality--the fact that all naturally-occurring DNA spirals in the same direction. Atoms of zinc are also being used as targets, to check the results of an experiment done recently by an Australian group in which zinc atoms excited by polarized electrons emitted light in a way that is forbidden by all known theories of atomic collisions. If the Australian result is reproduced, much of our basic theoretical knowledge on this topic will be shown to be in error. Improved sources of polarized electrons are also being developed, with the goal of ""turnkey"" ease of use. This project focuses on two particular ways to make polarized electrons: the first involves electron collisions with rubidium atoms in which spin is transferred from the rubidium to the free electrons. The second uses multiphoton ionization of semiconductors such as gallium arsenide to give the electrons a preferential spin direction. This research done to develop polarized electron technology holds the promise of providing new analytical tools that can be used for biological and materials research, and for industry. <br/><br/>The experiments involving collisions between polarized electrons and chiral molecules will extend previous work that showed chiral sensitivity in both quasi-elastic and reactive scattering with halocamphor targets. Now that such sensitivity has been observed, our goal is to demonstrate such effects in molecules that have biological significance, such as cysteine, and to study the effect of the maximum target nuclear charge and location of the target's chiral center on the chiral asymmetries we observe. The goal in the zinc experiments is to check whether the rather large value of canted linear polarization (polarization fraction P2) observed in fluorescence from excited zinc atoms is reproducible. No extant theory of electron-atom scattering, including the state-of-the-art ""R-matrix with pseudostates"" approach, has been able to confirm this result, even though they make quantitatively accurate predictions of other collision parameters for this system. Source development work will be based on the successfully demonstrated ""rubidium spin-filter"" design by our group, in which optically-pumped rubidium undergoes spin-exchange collisions with an incident unpolarized beam of electrons. This project will focus on improving the vacuum system, the rubidium target reliability, and the optical pumping protocol. It will also study a variety of buffer gases to understand the complex physics of the interaction between the electron beam and the rubidium vapor. In the gallium arsenide experiment, unamplified pulses from a femtosecond titanium-sapphire oscillator are used to photo-emit electrons. First experiments will investigate the intensity and polarization of the electrons emitted from bulk gallium arsenide and tip-like gallium arsenide shards. Then targets of gallium arsenide cusp arrays will be considered."
0.15,"The goal of this project is to advance the development of compact, next-generation light sources and other laser-based accelerators. Laser-plasma acceleration is a key enabling technology for a new generation of compact particle and radiation sources, but the existing theoretical understanding of the processes governing electron beam formation in such accelerators is incomplete. Further advances require development of computational tools with high physical fidelity, which is the expected outcome of this project. The project will aid in workforce development at all levels by providing training in the basic physics underlying advanced accelerator technologies. The research is expected to benefit society as a whole primarily through advancement of accelerator technologies based on plasma physics. Knowledge gained in this project will aid the effort to realize the technological promise of various laser-plasma accelerators with a wide range of applications from high-energy physics, astrophysics, and nuclear science to medicine, biology, and chemistry.<br/><br/>This project will result in the development of improved numerical models suitable for understanding the physics of electron beam formation and evolution in a large class of laser-plasma accelerators. This includes the development of a new two-dimensional Eulerian Vlasov-Maxwell simulation code. Comparisons of results from the new Vlasov-Maxwell solver and predictions of various particle methods will be used to identify regions of validity of the particle methods and to determine the key physical processes involved in electron beam formation and the origins of dark current in laser-plasma accelerators. The project will focus on studying electron beam formation in the bubble (or blow-out) regime. The results of this study will also inform the development of high-fidelity three-dimensional computational tools suitable for designing both near-term experiments and future facilities."
0.54,"Ranging from the low-energy phenomena of cosmology to the highest energy of stellar jets, neutrinos are a fundamental ingredient of the universe that we observe, and offer unique windows into its mysteries. The purpose of this project is a theoretical study of these windows. Part of the research will be on neutrinos from core collapse supernovae: how these neutrinos are affected by flavor oscillations, and what their detection will teach us about the physics that takes place at extremely high density near the collapsed core. High-energy neutrino emission will also be investigated as a way to explore the physics of particle accelerators in our galaxy and beyond, with focus on propagation effects and detectability at present and future neutrino telescopes. Another area of study will be the physics of neutrinos in the early universe, how they connect to the nature of the dark matter, and how they can possibly reveal the existence of new particles and forces. This project will contribute to the ongoing transition to a new phase of neutrino physics, characterized by new, more powerful experiments and by a deeper understanding of the neutrino phenomenology. <br/><br/>Being based at a large public university, the project will benefit young scientists through educational activities and direct involvement in research. Specifically, the grant will support a postdoc and a graduate student, thus offering them an opportunity to enter the field, and join a new generation of neutrino physicists that will sustain the new phase of discoveries ahead."
0.123843,"This award supports research at Augustana College (a small, undergraduate-only, liberal arts institution) to understand the structure of radioactive nuclei that have many excess neutrons. The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) produces radioactive beams with these excess neutrons. The beams are incident upon a target and the products of the nuclear reactions are measured in a variety of subatomic particle detectors. An important part of the project is the involvement of undergraduate students in these experiments and in development of the necessary detector instrumentation. Undergraduate research experience is important for many future technical careers as well as for graduate school. The funds for this award support the work of the undergraduates and the principle investigator to design and run experiments at NSCL, to analyze data, and to give talks and write papers on the results.<br/><br/>Experiments on exotic nuclear systems are necessary to place constraints on modern theoretical models. The nuclei studied as part of this project are neutron-unbound, which means that a neutron is emitted from a nucleus shortly after formation. Since the nuclei are so unstable, the radioactive nuclear ion beam at NSCL is utilized for these experiments. The charged particle left over after neutron emission is bent by the Sweeper Magnet into a suite of charged particle detectors. The emitted neutron is detected by the MoNA-LISA (Modular Neutron Array and the Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array). The research in this proposal involves data analysis of neutron-unbound nuclear systems and on-going equipment development. New data on the 24O(d,p) reaction will be taken to study negative parity states in 25O. The Augustana-MSU hodoscope, assembled, tested and installed by the Augustana nuclear group, is a key device for this experiment. In addition, the PI will work on the design, construction, and use of a new segmented target system for future experiments."
0.220753,"Cosmic rays are highly energetic sub-atomic particles from space that travel at velocities near the speed of light. The origin and acceleration mechanism for ultra-high energy cosmic rays, which likely come from extreme astrophysical phenomena outside our galaxy, are currently unknown. The Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest cosmic ray detector ever operated, with an instrumented area of more than 3000 square kilometers. Built in Malargue, Argentina by an international collaboration, the Pierre Auger Observatory was designed to study the origin and interactions of the highest energy particles in the Universe. This award supports the astroparticle group at the Colorado School of Mines in their work on Auger to address systematic uncertainties in the measured energy and composition of cosmic rays. They will utilize a recently completed upgrade to the laser calibration systems at Auger. They are also installing and will operate Auger detector tanks on the site of another cosmic ray observatory, the Telescope Array in Utah, to cross-calibrate the detectors from both observatories. The work of the Colorado School of Mines group also has broader applications to atmospheric sciences. They will use the laser calibration system to validate and then share atmospheric aerosol measurements. They will use the Auger optical detectors to study light emitted in the ionosphere about 90 km above certain thunderstorms. They plan to host a conference on interdisciplinary science with astroparticle detectors.<br/><br/>The Colorado School of Mines group will focus on improved air shower reconstruction methods and detailed measurements of systematic effects to address the unresolved discrepancies in cosmic ray data. The Raman LIDAR on the Auger Central Laser Facility will be used as independent atmospheric calibration. The Auger water Cherenkov Surface Detector tanks installed at the Telescope Array site will be used for a detailed cross-calibration between Auger, which views the southern sky, and Telescope Array, which views the northern sky. Planned analysis of the Auger data includes developing a new method to reconstruct air showers with the Surface Detectors, and developing a method for anisotropy scans that include energy and angular uncertainties."

As more complex molecules approach quantum degeneracy, the number and complexity of many-body models to describe them will also increase substantially. Additionally, searching for emergent phenomena such as quantum order requires exploration of vast parameter spaces and extrapolation using many different system sizes.

0.191558,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. DAMA at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy is the only experiment claiming a discovery of dark matter interactions from their observation of a predicted annual modulation of the signal rate. Recent results from some experiments (CoGeNT, CRESST, and CDMS-Si) may support the light WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) interpretation, while others do not (KIMS-CsI, LUX, and XENON-100, among others). Only an experiment using NaI(Tl) can perform a model-independent test. The SABRE (Sodium-iodide with Active Background REjection) experiment would shed light on this debate and thus direct future direct-detection searches.<br/><br/>The SABRE project provides ample opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers to gain experience and training for careers in the scientific community. SABRE is consulting with the Princeton Teacher Preparation Program office to discuss potential ways to provide additional educational and professional development opportunities for local high-school students and teachers.

Their partnerships with industry enable the development of new technologies, products, and measurement techniques that will be made available to the research and industrial market at large. <br/><br/>The SABRE R&D effort, funded by this award, aims to provide a proof-of-principle for such a detector by developing NaI(Tl) detectors with lower backgrounds and a lower energy threshold than DAMA.

0.280233,"The wide-ranging properties of substances around us (their different colors and smells, their taste, flammability, solubility, feel, toxicity) are tied closely to different physical arrangements of the atoms that define the molecules of the substance. When sunlight bleaches a shirt or aspirin relieves a headache, changes in molecular structure are responsible. Physicists model these arrangements of atoms in molecules as locations in a contour map called an ""energy landscape"" or a ""potential energy surface."" The stable atomic arrangements (the atomic arrangement for colored dye molecules, for example) are located in the valleys of the energy landscape. Chemical change, such as the change required to sun-bleach clothing dye, is a journey of the atomic positions from one valley to another. This NSF research project proposes a new way to guide the molecular journey by the use of laser light. Light doesn't move the atoms, but it can do something that is even better: it can change the shape of the energy landscape. Just like a bridge built over a gorge or a tunnel built through a mountain can reduce the difficulty of a journey over land, the new light-induced energy landscape can have shortcuts that encourage particular chemical changes. This project examines light-induced shortcuts at naturally occurring cross-roads in the energy landscapes. The new idea here is that laser light near these crossings, which are called ""conical intersections,"" can employ quantum interference to guide the molecule. The remarkable prediction is that by changing the properties of the laser light, the molecule will switch from one path at the crossroads to the other. This basic scientific understanding about how light can encourage or inhibit chemical change could lead to applications such as light-activated pharmaceuticals.<br/><br/>This project will investigate quantum control of trajectories nearby conical intersections (CIs), brought about by interference between the non-Born-Oppenheimer (NBO) couplings and laser-induced dipole couplings. The systems chosen for study are dissociation of singly ionized water and isomerization of doubly ionized acetylene. These are selected because they are hydrogen-rich small molecules with large NBO couplings and strong dipole couplings. The atomic motion will be launched by ionization of neutral water or acetylene using a high harmonics source of tunable vacuum ultraviolet radiation. The control field will be an ultrafast infrared laser pulse. The relative orientation of these NBO and dipole vector couplings can be inferred by mapping the momentum of dissociating fragments, or by Coulomb explosion imaging using a second intense infrared laser pulse following the reaction. The goal is to demonstrate control of the output channel via interference between NBO and dipole vector couplings, as revealed by the dependence of the dissociation or isomerization yield on the polarization, field strength, and frequency of the coupling field."
0.385466,"Gravity is the least understood fundamental force of nature - there is a 16 order of magnitude disparity between the energy scale of quantum gravity and that of the other Standard Model (electro-weak) forces.

This award funds research on the characteristics of gravity at sub-millimeter distances to be conducted through the use of cryogenic micro-cantilever beams which allow measurements of gravitational forces at sub-100 micron length scales at the atto-Newton level. The force sensitivity of these micro-cantilever experiments is limited by mechanical dissipation. To mitigate this mechanical loss, we will develop a novel apparatus to trap and cool dielectric nanospheres using lasers. By optically levitating the force sensor, an exquisite decoupling from the environment is possible.<br/><br/>Studies such as ours could lead to exciting new discoveries of physics beyond the Standard Model which has recently been famously validated by the detection of what appears to be the Higgs boson. Our research program is at the forefront of current knowledge and enhances the scientific competency of the state of Nevada, which is currently under-represented in terms of scientific endeavor.

At the other end of the energy scale, extremely low-energy collisions (at temperatures only tens of billionths of a degree above absolute zero) contribute to the phenomenon of superfluidity, in which a fluid (such as a very dilute gas) flows without any viscosity. Remarkably, the superfluid gas is itself a pristine ""universe,"" hosting its own ""particles"" that can be analogues of those existing (or expected to exist) in the cosmos. One example is a particle known as a magnetic monopole, which has not yet been observed but has recently been simulated in a superfluid. Creating such particle-like analogues permits scientists to study some of the properties of anticipated particles in the universe that would otherwise be completely inaccessible, as their creation would exceed the capabilities of even the most powerful particle accelerators. The research in this project is devoted to creation and study of several particle-like structures, including direct analogues of monopoles and more exotic structures known as ""knots"" and ""merons."" As simulations, they promise additional insight into the fundamental physical processes of our universe; but they are also of interest in their own right as examples of new and, in many cases, completely unexplored physics. The research program also provides training opportunities for highly motivated undergraduates, a postdoctoral researcher, and a secondary school teacher, with whom we will engage and motivate the next generation of scientists and citizens.<br/><br/><br/>Topological structures are central to diverse branches of physics at many different energy and length scales, including cosmology, particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. Superfluids, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, provide new and exciting opportunities to examine these structures in highly-controlled environments. Notably, the complexity of the order parameter describing the superfluid determines what kind of topological excitations it can support. Here, researchers will examine experimentally several aspects of these topological excitations, including quantized vortex dynamics in scalar condensates (total spin F=0) at nonzero temperature, creation of vortex molecules (or ""meron pairs"") in pseudospinor condensates (effective spin F=1/2), and linked field configurations in quantum fields (or ""knots"") in spinor condensates (spin F=1). The excitations will be imprinted by exposing the condensate to time-dependent magnetic and optical fields, and will subsequently be analyzed through examination of atomic density profiles using established imaging techniques. Subsequent studies will study their dynamics and interactions, developing new imaging techniques as required."
0.96,"Our most precise information about the structure and interactions of atoms is ultimately based on precise measurements of the light that is emitted and absorbed by various atoms and molecules. The spectrum of colors (or ""resonant frequencies"") of this light provides the basic input to calculations and measurements that are used for chemical identification, for reaction rate estimates, and for predictions of stability of new structures in a broad range of applications from medicine to defense and quality control in manufacturing. Recently, measurements on different types of hydrogen atoms (consisting of a central heavy proton and a planet-like electron or muon) are in disagreement about the radius of the proton. The discrepancy suggests one of 3 possibilities: (1) the theory of how charged particles interact, known as quantum electrodynamics or QED, is incorrect; (2) our knowledge of the structure of the proton is incorrect; or (3) there is some new kind of interaction or force of nature yet to be discovered. To decide whether the mystery is due to a problem with QED or not, two scientists from the University of California Riverside (UCR) propose to develop a novel instrument that will enable a measurement of the resonant frequency of positronium at ultimately 1000X more accuracy than the current state of the art. Because positronium is the simplest possible atom, consisting of an electron bound to an anti-electron, it should be described perfectly by QED theory. New measurements with the proposed instrument will decide whether QED theory is the problem and set significantly higher limits on the discrepancy in our understanding of the structure of the proton. The new instrument will lead to an improvement in the spectroscopy of unstable atoms at the frontier of the field of precision spectroscopy.<br/><br/>The purely leptonic atom positronium (Ps) is uniquely well-suited for testing bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED) and provides the understanding and background by which we may extract non-QED physics out of precision atomic measurements on heavier leptons and hadrons. Few have dared to try measurements on positronium at the few parts per trillion level that would allow insight into physics such as the proton charge radius and higher level recoil effect corrections in muonium, and that might show differences between light and heavy leptons. The ideal level spacing for a precision measurement on positronium is the 1S-2S interval at approximately 1 233 607 216 MHz. Knowledge of the first 10 digits of this interval has stood for 20 years with an uncertainty of ±3 MHz. The proposed instrument will implement several new techniques that would dramatically improve the accuracy of Ps atom spectroscopy and potentially other high resolution spectroscopy experiments by high precision individual atom trajectory analysis allowing line-centers to be measured to kHz precision. The laser frequency metrology during the transit of the atoms through the laser field will be accomplished with sub-kHz relative and absolute accuracies by recording the instantaneous deviations from the line-center of a thermally-stabilized ultra-low expansion glass reference cavity that is calibrated using a GPS-disciplined RF-referenced frequency comb. By providing ultrastable environmental, mechanical, and vibrational isolation, the overall specifications of the instrument will be sufficient to produce a narrow linewidth (~2 MHz), a reduction in systematic errors to enable up to 1000X increase in accuracy, and a 10X higher count rate to enable precision measurements in manageable measurement durations (months vs years)."
0.10301,"A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a cold gas of many identical atoms that have collected into the lowest energy state of a container. A BEC can exhibit frictionless flow and unique interference properties that make it an atomic analog of a laser. The coherence of light in lasers has found extraordinary applications in optical communication, medical imaging, and various industrial applications. The coherence of atoms may open new paths to atom-based quantum computation, simulation of new states of matter, and advances in high precision metrology. It has been proposed that a BEC formed from positronium (Ps) atoms (bound states of electrons and their positron antiparticles) would be of unique interest because it could exhibit double coherence, simultaneously condensing like a BEC and, at sufficiently high densities, exhibiting laser-like effects due to stimulated annihilation. Because positronium is thousands of times lighter than ordinary atoms, a positronium BEC does not need to be held at ultra-low temperatures and could even exist at room temperature, making it convenient for eventually making a practical gamma ray laser. An application of the positronium BEC would be the ability to induce coherent Ps atom emission to produce extremely monoenergetic atoms for ultrahigh precision optical spectroscopy measurements. The positronium BEC is predicted to form at 100 times higher density of positronium atoms than has ever been produced in a laboratory before. Two scientists from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) propose to study positronium at 100 times higher density and to observe the first positronium BEC. <br/><br/>This is an ongoing project at the University of California Riverside (UCR) with the goal of studying the physics of a cold, dense gas of positronium (Ps), an ultra-light hydrogenic bound state of an electron and its positron antiparticle. Although the triplet ground state of Ps has a mean lifetime of only 142 ns, it is possible to make precision measurements of the energy levels of Ps and to observe Ps interactions with atoms, molecules and condensed mater. Scientists at UCR have thus far been able to create Ps densities sufficient to produce the dipositronium molecule (Ps2) for the first time. In this new phase of the project they will create a much denser Ps gas and study the effect that Bose-Einstein statistics is expected to have on atoms that are unit spin Bose particles. The specific objectives are: (1) Produce Ps pulses in a target with surface densities more than one hundred times greater than before; (2) Measure cooling rates of Ps atoms in cavities at cryogenic temperatures; (3) Observe an excess of low momentum cold Ps atoms in 2D cavities due to the effect of Bose statistics; and (4) Search for a Ps Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in 3D cavities at low temperature. Ps momentum distributions and temperatures for identifying a BEC will be measured directly in real time with a newly NSF-funded instrument specifically designed for this purpose."
0.224532,"Elementary particles have an intrinsic property called spin--they act as if they were constantly spinning around like tops. Just as a tops precess in the presence of gravity, the spins of fundamental particles precess in a magnetic field. This precession is the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance which is the underlying physics used in the medical diagnostic known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently developed precision optical techniques have allowed the study of interactions with particle spins with unprecedented precision. The researchers will use these precision techniques as tools to investigate the fundamental forces and symmetries of nature. At the most basic level, our present understanding of nature is summarized in the ""Standard Model' of particle physics. This model requires four fundamental forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak) to describe all of reality as it is presently known. In one experiment, the investigators will look for a new long-range force between particle spins that can't be described by the Standard Model. To optimize their search, they will measure the interaction of their laboratory spins with the sum of all of the electron spins within the Earth. In their other experiment, the researchers hope eventually to see if the fundamental laws of nature might be asymmetric in time. This breaking of ""time symmetry"" can be studied by looking for the precession of a nuclear spin in an electric field. Here the experimental sensitivity can be increased by using a very cold beam of molecules. Additional time asymmetry (beyond that which has already been observed) is believed to be necessary to explain the existence of our universe. Without time-reversal violation, our universe would have produced equal amounts of matter and anti-matter. Their mutual annihilation would not have allowed for the formation of galaxies, stars, planets and life. <br/><br/>Recently, the researchers created the first map of the electron-spin density within the Earth. These ""geo-electrons"" constitute the largest polarized spin source known. Precision measurement of spin-precession frequencies in laboratories at the surface of the Earth as a function of their applied magnetic-field direction, allows one to look for long-range spin-spin interactions (LRSSI) between the geo-electrons and the laboratory spins. In the first proposed experiment, a refined spin-precession apparatus will be constructed which is both well calibrated and relatively immune to AC light effects. This should allow at least an order of magnitude improvement in the sensitivity of these measurements to LRSSI. If an effect is seen it would suggest the existence of a new force of nature. In current models this force might be associated with an ultra-light vector meson, a ""dark"" photon, the ""unparticle,"" or torsion gravity. In the second proposed experiment, critical parameters that determine the viability of an electric-dipole moment (edm) experiment in thallium fluoride (TlF) will be investigated using an ultraviolet laser and a cold molecular source. Specifically, the researchers hope to demonstrate the existence of a cycling transition in TlF and to measure the efficiency with which TlF can be ablated from a surface. If the results of these measurements are favorable, TlF will then be proposed as a candidate system for a cold-beam precision measurement of the edm of the thallium nucleus. The discovery of a permanent nuclear edm would imply a violation of time symmetry and could help explain the existence of our matter-dominated universe."
0.275956,"The goal of this project is to investigate quantum phases of strongly correlated systems with an emphasis on cold polar molecule setups. Strong correlations are at the core of many fascinating biological, chemical, and physical systems. The understanding of these systems is one of the major challenges facing physicists and a key issue in the community. Indeed, strongly correlated systems hold great potential in revolutionizing technological applications in medicine, communications, and computations. Within the framework of this project, novel extensions of a path-integral quantum Monte Carlo algorithm will be developed. The use of these Monte Carlo techniques will produce reliable and accurate results with controlled uncertainty. Unbiased theoretical predictions are timely and crucial to guide experimentalists in helping interpret experimental results and/or suggest observables. Moreover, the numerical results that will be obtained in this project can provide a platform for testing and validating analytical techniques. Indeed, these numerical techniques will also greatly contribute to the deeper understanding of certain classes of quantum many-body models which are, or will soon be, realizable in Atomic Molecular and Optical (AMO) experiments. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigator and her students will develop extensions of quantum Monte Carlo techniques needed to study strongly-correlated many-body systems with an emphasis on cold polar molecules in optical lattice setups. When free of the sign problem, quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful theoretical tool to study equilibrium properties of strongly interacting systems, especially in dimensions higher than one. In this project the investigator will use the Worm algorithm to study properties of many-body strongly correlated systems of bosonic polar molecules trapped in optical lattice geometries. Emphasis will be given on geometries for which the anisotropic nature of the dipolar interaction will play a major role in determining the phase diagram of the system. The geometries that will be studied include stacks of one- and two-dimensional layers, and two-dimensional gases where molecules have tilted dipole moments. Considering the recent successful experimental advances in cold polar molecule experiments, these phases are very likely to be within reach in the near future. Therefore, accurate and reliable theoretical predictions are timely and valuable to the experimental community. The single-worm algorithm is not suitable to study the quantum phases of these multimers. In this project, the investigator plans to develop three different non-trivial extensions of the single-worm algorithm: (i) N-distinguishable-worms, (ii) N-indistinguishable-worms, and (iii) a hybrid algorithm with both distinguishable and indistinguishable worms. These multi-worm algorithms for quantum systems will allow for the study of multimer formation in a rich variety of optical lattice dipolar systems."
0.05984,"To evaluate cortical bone porosity Nuclear Magnetic Resonance equipment can be used. The hydrogen atom attached to oxygen in the water molecules in biological tissue can be used to assess how far a water molecule moves in the bone due to random motion during a specific time of measurement. This information can be used to obtain a map of the pore sizes in the bone and thus is of practical use in medicine. Similar techniques have been successful in assessing the pore sizes of oil rich earth samples to assess oil content. The acquisition of the equipment requested in this proposal will allow Texas A&M International University, a minority serving institution (93% Hispanic students), to enhance the quality of student research/instruction. The proposed equipment will help faculty and students to: (1) study and understand the principle of magnetic angle spinning NMR and solid state NMR; (2) pursue and develop bone related research; and (3) learn solid state NMR technology and apply it to a variety of different applications. Research findings and results will be disseminated in journals and at professional conferences. Several graduate and more than 40 undergraduate students will be involved in NMR related workshops and projects each year. This equipment will also be of benefit for the studies of physics, chemistry, and bioengineering, as well as will be used in classes of more than 20 undergraduates each year for the training of critical thinking and research methodology. The addition of this spectrometer probe will make the science program at TAMIU more competitive, aid the recruitment of new faculty and students, and enable more primarily minority undergraduate and graduate students to conduct high quality research in science degree programs at TAMIU.<br/><br/>The PI's current low-field bench-top NMR system uses NMR CPMG spin-spin (T2) relaxation time signal due to water in mobile phase to characterize the cortical bone porosity and pore size distribution, and uses NMR free induction decay (FID) measurements to determine water components in bound and mobile phases. With this requested instrumentation the PI can conduct further research into the 1H environments of bone materials to identify the locations of bone minerals and bone architecture, including water. Specifically, the PI will characterize how water stabilizes the mineral structure and how it couples with mineral crystallites to the surrounding bone structure. We hypothesize that low-field NMR and high field with magnetic angle spinning (MAS) NMR will provide a more complete interpretation of water distribution in bone microstructure, and these data are important to assess bone quality and predict the mechanical behavior of bone. In addition, the high-field magnetic angle spinning (MAS) technique can be used to decouple and reduce the dipolar and susceptibility effect between the solid and the liquid-like phases. This research will provide a more complete picture of bone microstructure to be used as the basis for further bone related research, and material and edical applications. The requested instrumentation will provide other faculty with a necessary tool for use in pursuing aspects of their research that are presently not available on the TAMIU campus."
0.16,"In virtually every part of the brain, information about the sensory environment, internal body states, or intended movements is encoded by more than one neuron. This was apparent as early as the nineteenth century from the extensive interconnectivity of nearby neurons and continues to be apparent from numerous measurements of the tuning curves and correlation of nearby neurons. Despite its fundamental importance, population neural codes are poorly understood. In this project, the PI will combine large-scale neural recording methods with state-of-the-art theoretical analyses to study collective phenomena in population neural codes. The project will focus on the retina as a model system, where the quality and completeness of experimental data is the greatest. The project will give us a thorough and clear understanding of what are the ""ingredients"" needed at the population level to give rise to criticality, which will be important in generating hypotheses about what other regions of the brain might exhibit criticality in their population codes. It will also explore a novel hypothesis about how critical population states give rise to a discrete aspect of the neural code and one that is highly robust to neural noise. This could give us new insight into how we effortlessly divide the sensory world into objects. <br/><br/>The PI has an extensive track record in multi-electrode recording from the vertebrate retina, along with applying maximum entropy models to analyze states of network activity. The PI hypothesizes that the retinal population code has an unusual and nontrivial structure that it analogous to the critical state in physical systems. This structure leads to the definition of a ""collective mode"" of neural activity, which is a set of neural activity states that groups visual stimuli into discrete classes. These collective modes constitute a novel hypothesis about population neural codes that is qualitatively different from the view of information encoding at the single-neuron level. The proposed projects aims are: understanding the origin of criticality, including studying the role of correlations in the stimulus, using adaptation to test how specifically retinal circuitry is tuned to give rise to criticality, studying the pattern and strength of correlation required for any network to give rise to criticality as well as formulating receptive field models to see what degrees of overlap and functional heterogeneity are required in defining collective modes of neural activity and studying what stimuli they encode and how reliably they are activated by a given visual stimulus. The broader impacts of the proposed work lie along three distinct directions:(i) the potential to develop new concepts about population neural codes that could prove applicable across many different brain regions; (ii) the development and dissemination of software to perform maximum entropy fits to neural data, which could help spur on the research programs of many labs that use these methods to analyze neural populations; (iii) the broadening of our ideas about critical systems in physics to include the kind of asymmetric, intermediate cases found in biology.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems."
0.296638,"This EAGER project ""Restriction Spectrum Imaging for evaluating glioma treatment response"" will create a unique data set that can be used by theoretical scientists to understand how these hard to treat tumors respond and evade treatment. This high-precision data is needed for scientists to be able to distinguish between different models of cancer growth that currently exist. Understanding tumor growth during treatment will help with the regiment of medicines used for glioma treatment and will reveal how some cells die and others evade current therapies, which is essential for the development of better strategies to treat this lethal disease. The proposed technique is based on the different physics of normal and cancerous tissue and fits well within the Physics of Living Systems (PoLS) program at NSF as a high-risk, but high-return project.<br/><br/>The need for a human tumor growth data set that is well characterized and with low noise, which can be used by the theoretical physics community to test novel theories of tumor kinetics was recognized at: ""The Physical Principles of Human Cancer Imaging Workshop"" held on November 4-5, 2013 in Boston. This bold project, from a young scientist, reflects this need and the objective of this research is to evaluate the utility of a novel, non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging technique, Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI), to detect and quantify tumor response to treatment in glioma patients. The specific objectives are to 1) procure and organize existing (and ongoing) MRI data sets (including RSI) collected across time on glioma patients at UCSD Moores Cancer Center who receive standard of care therapy which may include radiation, chemo, and anti-VEGF treatments. 2) With the help of a board certified neuro-radiologist, the second objective would be to evaluate glioma treatment response in these patients using standard published radiographic response criteria (RANO/McDonald/RECIST). 3) The final objective would be to analyze and quantify tumor cell populations directly using RSI (including the spatial extent (3D volume) and density (intensity-weighted volume)) and compare these quantitative RSI measures with the standard response criteria. RSI is a technique developed by the PI that has recently been shown to be resistant to pseudo-response and pseudo-progression, both of which plague standard radiographic response criteria and pose severe limitations to researchers involved in mathematical and physical modeling of tumor spread and resistance. RSI quantitative measures of tumor cell populations that are insensitive to pseudo-response and pseudo-progression will allow researchers and clinicians to further understand the temporal and treatment dynamics of cancer cells, to develop more targeted cancer treatments and to advance mathematical and physical models of the disease. RSI mapping of tumor cell populations may ultimately transform clinical practice and change clinical care for cancer patients. By providing an objective and quantitative measure of tumor cell volume and density directly on imaging non-invasively, patients who undergo cancer treatment may be evaluated and monitored over time with RSI to see if and where the cancer spreads to or alternatively if the particular cancer treatment is working."
0.299994,"Most brain areas (like visual or motor cortex) are believed to have a map in which neuron location is related to the type of information that neuron processes. For example, in the visual cortex, neurons process information about a part of the visual world that is closely related to their map location in the brain. The idea explored in this project is that some important brain areas have an antimap, rather than a map, in which the type of information conveyed by a neuron is not at all related to its location in the antimap. Instead, information is spread out over the antimap in a way that makes it possible to get all of the available information from a small collection of any neurons in the antimap, as long as a critical number of neurons is selected. The conceptual basis for this antimap idea comes from a new field of mathematics and computer science called ""compressed sensing"", and compressed sensing places strict limits on the possible ways brain areas can communicate if an antimap is to be formed. A goal of the project, then, is to discover if the evolutionarily ancient brain areas noted above conform to these limits. The reason for the brain to use antimaps is that they provide information in a format that can be used to collect arbitrary pieces of information into a single ""object"" through learning. The goal of this EAGER project is to explore the new idea about how information is represented in four evolutionarily ancient brain areas: hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory cortex, and basal ganglia, present in all vertebrates. To achieve this goal the PI will search the literature on anatomical and physiological characteristics of inputs to these four areas (and sub-parts of them), and will compile quantitative neuroanatomical data that will permit a comparison of what is observed with what the idea predicts. The outcome will determine the extent to which this new idea is tenable and lead to understanding its possible implications for computations in the various brain areas. <br/><br/>This work is, by its nature, interdisciplinary as it relies on ideas from neurobiology, mathematics and computer science, and on the methods of theoretical physics. If the idea of antimaps is correct, all vertebrate (and perhaps invertebrate) brains use them to solve a wide variety of computational problems. Furthermore, knowing how information is represented in the brain is fundamental to understanding how the brain works, and if this new idea is correct it will play an essential role in achieving the goals of the BRAIN initiative."

0.559633,"This project probes the fundamental physics of neutrinos and nuclei by exploiting the intersection of exciting new developments in nuclear physics and neutrino physics on the one hand, and the increasingly sophisticated astrophysical and astronomical probes of compact objects, nucleosynthesis histories, and cosmology on the other. A key issue in this enterprise will be studying how neutrinos interact in dense matter and how these interactions may cause neutrinos to change their flavors. To these ends, this UCSD effort will work toward: (1) Formulating and understanding the quantum kinetic equations which govern neutrino flavor evolution in a general medium; (2) Constructing large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor evolution in various supernova, stellar collapse, and compact object merger environments and assessing the feedback of this neutrino flavor physics on the prospects for the synthesis of nuclei in these sites; (3) Understanding neutrino-nucleus interactions, nuclear partition functions, and weak strength distributions in high temperature environments; and (4) Assessing how uncertainties and new beyond-standard-model possibilities in the neutrino sector could impact ideas on nucleosynthesis, dark matter, compact object physics, and cosmology, with an eye toward finding constraints otherwise unobtainable in the laboratory.<br/><br/>The research supported in this project will provide insights into how atomic nuclei and radiation behave in extreme conditions of temperature and density. In turn, these insights could give important clues about the nature of some elementary particles and the origin of the elements, for example, in the fiery interiors of supernova explosions, or at the time when the universe was only seconds old. These are fundamental questions that will provide unique opportunities for the training of young scientists, nuclear physicists, at both the graduate and undergraduate levels."
0.091626,"As electronic devices continue to increase their processing speeds, the demand for high speed internet communications and data networks will require new technologies for storing and processing large amounts of data. Electronics are built on the use of the electron to carry and process information, and in an analogous way the field of photonics is developing devices that use particles of light (photons) to carry and process information. Individual photons obey the laws of quantum mechanics, so in order to fully understand the operation of photonic devices, quantum measurements will be performed on these new devices. One particularly essential component is a memory or information storage device. Many candidates for photonic memory exist but few have been characterized at the quantum (few-photon) level. This research program will apply new techniques for measuring the quantum properties of light to a variety of photonic memory devices. The result will be a deeper understanding of device operation that may lead to optimized devices for future applications.<br/><br/>Photonic memory devices have been demonstrated using slow and stored-light protocols based on Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) in Rubidium. The goal of this program is to measure the quantum state of light retrieved from several implementations of these devices in both warm and cold Rubidium vapor samples. The light stored and retrieved from such systems will be measured and analyzed using a highly efficient array of low-noise photodetectors. This technique can simultaneously measure multiple optical modes and will be used to correlate multiple modes and determine which modes (or combinations of modes) are most robust under different storage conditions. A full quantum-mechanical understanding of the optical signal retrieved from memory allows complete characterization of the device performance and will inform future work in the development of photonic memory devices."
0.471999,"The last decade has produced a remarkable revolution in neutrino physics. We now know that at least some of the three flavors of neutrino have finite mass, and that flavor transformations occur through the process known as neutrino oscillations. Neutrino flavor oscillations are governed by a matrix with three mixing angles and a Charge-Parity (CP) violating phase. It is currently thought that the possibility of CP symmetry violation in the neutrino sector is the best possibility for explaining the apparent matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. <br/><br/>Two of the three mixing angles have been well determined by previous experiments. This award provides base support for work on determining the final mixing angle (known as theta-13) through the precision study of the oscillation of antineutrinos emitted from the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in China. This experiment has been under construction for several years, and has just begun to acquire data using two of the full complement of eight antineutrino detectors. The Daya Bay experiment has recently published their initial results for theta-13.

Since the incident at Fukushima in Japan, the public interest in nuclear power and its safety has been heightened. It is important to provide teachers and students with up-to-date and accurate information related to the issues associated with nuclear power.

This project is a first step towards the development of transformative theories and data analysis methods for studying the brain. In this project, the investigators will construct a theoretical framework at the interface between physics, engineering and biology that studies zero-one laws/phase transitions and related simplicities arising from having many degrees of freedom in the system. The resulting methods will be applied to both engineering examples and biological networks, particularly networks connecting neurons or brain regions. The investigators span a broad interdisciplinary spectrum ranging from theoretical physics and control theory to cell biology and neurobiology, and will engage in dissemination of the results and educating students and researchers across a broad spectrum in the subject matter of the proposal. In particular the researchers will pursue two neuroscience applications of the theoretical framework and tools developed in this proposal. The first will be directed to the analysis of experimentally determined neural circuits, and the second directed towards brain rhythms, with a focus on understanding the corresponding phase diagrams and the controllability of abnormal rhythms. They expect to recover the receptor field structure of the ganglion cells in the retina from such an analysis. These methods also will be applied to the mouse brain meso-circuit. Their analysis will go beyond graph-theoretic measures of the network and provide a bridge to activity measurements as well as to functional analysis of neuroanatomical circuitry, which is currently lacking. The investigators will also explore the consequences of the theoretical framework derived in this paper to networks of coupled, heterogeneous neural oscillators, with a distributed drive. The PIs will facilitate this impact by training researchers as well as holding meetings and workshops. The postdoc and the student will play an active role in organizing these two workshops. The PIs will publish preferentially with open access option, using funds from the grant.

0.42,"In this project, the PI will integrate experiment and theory to measure and understand the relationship between fluctuations of various observed quantities and the responses of a living system to designed (pulsatile) perturbations. The approach centers on a unique technology that the PI has developed and implemented, combining microfluidics, single-cell imaging, quantitative analysis, and stochastic modeling of growth and division of Caulobacter crescentus. The project seeks to employ this approach to evaluate models for growth control and the degree to which cells trade energy, speed, and accuracy; identify relations constraining the statistics of cell-cycle periods under steady and changing conditions; and engineer a system in which the interactions between cells in a population can be modulated to study spontaneous symmetry breaking. These goals are important for establishing the fundamental physics of systems far from equilibrium. They also provide examples as to how scaling and fluctuation relations can be used to provide direct constraints on regulatory dynamics. In this way, these studies complement common biological methods for assembling information about molecular concentrations and interactions. The investigator seeks to bring core concepts of the project, such as the importance of going beyond averages to study statistical distributions, to a broader audience interested in living systems. To this end, the PI will develop a summer course to introduce high school teachers to basic concepts in probability, energy, and entropy in biological systems through hands-on experimentation and self-guided web-based tutorials.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.184004,"The essence of modern Physics is quantum mechanics. In particular, the structure of the atomic nucleus and the surrounding electrons, and the corresponding structure of molecules and materials is inherently quantum mechanical. Understanding the quantum structure of atoms, molecules, and materials at room temperature and higher, where thousands or millions or more quantum states are populated, is possible using the selectivity of lasers. However, at ultracold temperatures of less than 0.001 K, only a few quantum states are populated and exotic phenomena such as superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation of many particles, each in a single unique quantum state are possible. This research involves understanding the quantum states of simple molecules composed of two atoms at ultracold temperatures, including how the molecules are formed in particular selectable states and how the molecules change when they are exposed to light of specific wavelengths or collide with other molecules or atoms. In response, they may emit light, emit an electron, or split into two atoms. There are a number of interesting possible applications of this behavior such as quantum cryptography, quantum computing and quantum simulation of more complex systems. This area of frontier research provides an uncharted and challenging education for students in Physics and related fields.<br/><br/>In our project, we will work with two carefully selected diatomic molecules, Rb2 and KRb. One fascinating electronic quantum state in both molecules is the triplet state. This state can in principle decay, but calculations for Rb2 predict it has a very long lifetime of up to 200 seconds in its lowest rovibrational level, during which it can be studied. Our experiments will define the limits of this ""metastability"" at ultracold temperatures due to spontaneous emission of light or to collisions with ultracold atoms or molecules. We will also study another fascinating type of electronic quantum state in these molecules: the so-called ""trilobite-like"" or ""butterfly"" electronic quantum states, where a completely new kind of chemical bonding takes place at internuclear distances at least ten times larger than ordinary chemical bonds. Their name comes from the complex spatial structures of the square of the electronic wavefunction, which can resemble ancient trilobites or modern butterflies. This novel bonding involves the attraction between the electron of a highly excited ""Rydberg"" atom with a second ground state atom imbedded within the large Rydberg electronic wavefunction. Spectroscopy will determine the predicted and unusual ""interatomic roller coaster"" potential energy curves with numerous maxima and minima, as well as the multiple decay processes that determine lifetimes of these states. In particular, the mechanisms of the puzzlingly rapid rates of decay of these states to (Rb2) cation and the negative electron will be determined. We will also investigate the long-range electronic states arising from the ion-pair (Rb cation and Rb anion), some in the same region of energy and internuclear distance as the ""butterfly"" states. These are ""Heavy Rydberg"" states, bound by the Coulomb attraction in the same way as in the H atom. The ion pair experiments will yield valuable information on the coupling of shorter range covalent states, where the bonding electrons are shared, to the longer range ionic states, where the two valence electrons clearly reside on one of the atoms."
0.128997,"This award will lead to development of an innovative computer code for high-fidelity simulation of electron beams, drawing on recent advances in parallel computer architectures and applied mathematics. When electron bunches traveling at nearly the speed of light are forced by accelerator magnets to traverse a curved path, they emit bright ultraviolet or x-ray radiation. This radiation traveling a straight path catches up with the electron beam and can severely degrade its experimental usefulness. The first step in mitigating these damaging effects is to develop a trustworthy computer code capable of simulating the physics of this beam self-interaction. This project will enable the development of such a code. For the society in general, this research is a step in developing ultra-bright light sources which are essential tools for discoveries and innovations in physical, biological, energy and medical sciences. For example, they allow scientists to analyze chemical reactions, molecular structures and provide ways to develop new drugs. By training young researchers, this project will increase the number of much-needed accelerator scientists in the nation and make considerable effort in recruiting qualified female and under-represented minority candidates.<br/><br/>Direct simulation of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in two and three dimensions is prohibitively costly in terms of efficiency and memory requirements. Consequently, the present CSR codes employ various approximations that are inadequate for resolving essential physics in many realistic situations. These situations where existing CSR codes fail will become commonplace as the design of next-generation light sources commences. This project will design, benchmark and disseminate to the community a fundamentally new, multiscale, particle-in-cell code for modeling CSR, optimized to run on a parallel computational platform consisting of graphical processing units (GPUs). The code will exploit advantages of casting the problem in wavelet basis: (i) ability to retain information about the dynamics over the hierarchy of scales; (ii) removal of numerical noise by thresholding of the wavelet coefficients; and (iii) compact representation of data and operators, resulting in significant reduction of the computational load. Using NVIDIA's CUDA framework, a number of new code's vital numerical algorithms will be designed to run on a parallel GPU platform, and the successful matching of the algorithms and architecture will lead to code's scalability. The new code will be freely available to the community to enable modeling of a number of different machines."
0.526059,"Gaining a quantitative description of the nature of strongly bound systems is of great importance for our understanding of the fundamental structure and origin of matter. Revealing the inner structure of the core of the atom that contains the protons and neutrons and understanding the dynamics that bind these most basic elements of nuclear physics is an essential part to advance this knowledge. This project is aimed at conducting leading-edge research to construct a neutral particle spectrometer (NPS) critical to confirm the understanding of the structure of the proton. The NPS enables a multifaceted experimental physics program at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, in which the PIs play a leading role. The participation of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students is an integral part of this project and contributes to the development of the technological work force in the USA. The all-female project leadership will provide role models that could encourage under-represented groups to pursue advanced studies in physics or technical fields.<br/><br/>The two-arm combination of neutral-particle detection as provided by the NPS and a high-resolution magnetic spectrometer offers unique scientific capabilities to push the energy scale for studies of the transverse spatial and momentum structure of the nucleon through reactions with neutral particles requiring precision and high luminosity. The NPS allows accurate access to measurements of so-called hard exclusive (the recoiling proton stays intact in the energetic electron-quark scattering process) and semi-inclusive (the energy loss of the electron-quark scattering process gets predominantly absorbed by a single pion or kaon) scattering processes. To extract the rich information on proton structure through spatial and momentum imaging, it is of prime importance to show in accurate measurements, pushing the energy scales, that the scattering process is understood. Precision measurements of real photons or neutral-pions with the NPS offer unique advantages here. The instrument will be built by a collaboration of researchers forming a consortium led by the Catholic Univ. of America and Ohio Univ. It will also include the Old Dominion Univ. and as non-lead partners, the Jefferson Lab, North Carolina A&T University, the Yerevan Physics Institute, U. of Glasgow, and the Institute of Nuclear Physics at Orsay."
0.617739,"In this project, the PI will develop an intermediate, cell and tissue-level description of tissue and organ morphogenesis that would on one side connect to specific molecular pathways and on the other to the macroscopic phenotypes, thus bridging the gap between the molecular and organismal scales. On this level developmental processes directly involve physical interactions and physics ideas regarding collective phenomena and pattern formation. The PI will develop theoretical models that explain existing experimental observations and generate falsifiable quantitative hypotheses, which will guide new experiments with the long-term goal of elucidating dynamics of morphogenesis. The project will focus on several model systems where extensive experimentally acquired knowledge is available. Specifically, the proposed project will: 1) Investigate the dynamics of cell rearrangement that drives germ-band extension in Drosophila embryo. Based on the quantitative analysis of time-lapse fluorescent microscopy data from T. Lecuit's lab (IBDM, Marseille) the PI will formulate and analyze models of stress and planar cell polarization-dependent mechanical remodeling of cellular cytoskeleton and intercellular adhesion, which causes convergent extension of epithelial tissue. 2) Develop a model of pattern formation in the process of hair-cell differentiation in the avian cochlea. The PI will specifically address the dynamical interplay of lateral inhibition, due to Notch/Delta cell-contact signaling, with cell division and rearrangement that modify tissue morphology. The PI will collaborate with D. Sprinzak (Tel Aviv U) in the design of an experimental investigation of this phenomenon and in the interpretation of the results. 3) Develop a model of intercellular contact signaling mediated by Fat/Ds cell-adhesion proteins, which have been implicated in cell polarity and regulation of growth in Drosophila imaginal discs. The PI will carry out quantitative analysis of the effects of clonal genetic perturbations using extensive existing data from K. Irvine's lab (HHMI and Rutgers), compare results with model predictions and use the model to design new experiments. The PI will collaborate with D. Sprinzak (Tel Aviv U) on the design of the ""bottom-up"" synthetic reconstruction study of the Fat/Ds signaling. The PI will work with physics students encouraging and guiding their research on biology problems. As a member of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP), the PI coordinates the Interdisciplinary Biology Initiative that runs programs designed to break barriers between disciplines. The PI will expand these interdisciplinary activities to include, in collaboration with CNSI and MCD Biology Dept on the UCSB campus, a summer experimental research course on the subject of ""Dynamics of Development"". This course, to be held in 2013, will be the inaugural session of the Santa Barbara Advanced School of Quantitative Biology that is being set up by the PI. The course will teach physics and biology students how quantitative methods and ideas can be applied to the study of animal development."
0.075,"The weak interaction, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, is responsible for the type of radioactive decay called beta decay. Precise measurements of beta decay can probe the limits of our understanding of the weak interaction, complementing particle collider experiments in the search for new physics while being much less costly. The recent development of facilities, such as at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, that can produce a variety of beams of radioactive isotopes has created new opportunities for improved beta decay measurements. To fully exploit the potential of these new isotopes requires a good understanding of the response of various types of particle detectors. Understanding the response of particle detectors is also important for many applications in homeland security, nuclear safeguards, and medicine. The instrument to be acquired through this grant will enable the measurement of the response of a variety of particle detectors to a new level of precision over a wide energy range. <br/><br/>Precise measurements of the shapes of spectra in nuclear beta decay are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model of particle interactions. The recent development of powerful radioactive beam facilities has created a new opportunity for improved measurements of nuclear beta spectrum shapes through implantation of the nuclei in detectors that fully contain the emitted particles. In the ideal case, this provides measurements free of many of the systematic e&#64256;ects more conventional beta spectroscopy is subject to. Fully exploiting the potential of the new detector method, however, requires precise knowledge of implantation detector response. This detector response characterization is the primary research to be enabled by the proposed acquisition of an all-digital multi-parameter gamma spectroscopy system. The basis of the characterizations is the Wide Angle Compton Coincidence technique. This technique uses Compton scattering with standard gamma sources of modest strength to characterize the energy dependent electron response of essentially any detector material relative to, for example, a High Purity Germanium detector. The system acquired under this proposal will enable the measurement of the nonlinearity of a wide variety of detectors to a new level of precision and over a wider energy range than presently exists."
0.405,"The extremely large polarizability of Rydberg atoms leads to interactions at internuclear distances of microns that are larger than their kinetic energies at ultracold temperatures (T less than 1 milliKelvin). The long range interactions make ultracold Rydberg atoms important systems for studying dipolar quantum gases, building single photon sources and constructing quantum gates. Their sensitivity to electric fields makes Rydberg atoms useful for applications in sensing and measurement standards. The ability to generate quantum entangled material particles using Rydberg atom dipole blockade, increase light matter interaction times, and create exotic states, like macrodimers and trilobite molecules, has further motivated the study of ultracold Rydberg atoms. Key questions that we are addressing are: how can the anisotropy of the interactions be controlled, what is the role of static background electric fields, how does Rydberg atom-electron scattering in ultracold gases lead to the formation of interesting states of matter and what happens when two Rydberg atoms interact at short range? <br/><br/>Specifically, the interaction between ultracold ground state atoms and Rydberg atom electrons is being investigated experimentally with a unique collision imaging spectrometer. Phase transitions and magnetic phenomena that are predicted to occur due to the scattering of the weakly bound Rydberg electron from the ground state atoms are being studied. These experiments complement others on Rydberg atom- Rydberg atom interactions, which quantitatively measure the anisotropy of the interactions and their influence on phase transitions that are postulated to occur in ultracold Rydberg gases. The results of these experiments are being compared to theory done by our research group. This award supports two graduate students and enables undergraduate research projects to be carried out on the apparatus."
0.2,"This project seeks to further our fundamental understanding of plasma turbulence and flows by making detailed comparisons of large-scale computer models with carefully controlled laboratory experiments. Turbulence and its effects are ubiquitous in magnetized plasmas on Earth, in near space, and throughout the universe. Turbulence can drive increased transport of particles, heat, and momentum, which affects our ability to confine plasmas for applications on Earth, such as fusion energy, and can play an important role in accelerating particles to high energies, for example in the space weather environment comprising the Sun and Earth. The large numbers of high energy particles generated during space weather events have the potential to seriously impact satellites, communications, and power systems on Earth. Being able to reliably predict such events requires a detailed understanding of the underlying physics, including the physics of turbulence and the interaction of turbulence and flows. <br/><br/>The goal of this work is to validate, through controlled laboratory experiments and close experiment-theory-model coupling, a fully global, nonlinear two-fluid model appropriate for understanding turbulence and transport dynamics in a collisional laboratory plasma. Despite a long and ongoing history of work to understand the dynamics of plasma turbulence in the presence of sheared flows, there still appears to be no validated model that can accurately reproduce experimental observations over a wide range of turbulent states in even relatively simple, well-controlled experiments. Even in these 'simple' laboratory experiments, enough complicating physics are present so that interpreting measurements purely experimentally, via quasilinear theories, or via local nonlinear models seems to be difficult or impossible. The proposed experiments will take place in the dual-source HelCat (Helicon-Cathode) device at the University of New Mexico. HelCat is a flexible device that provides unique capabilities important to these experiments. The GBS (Global Braginskii Solver), a fully 3D global drift-reduced Braginskii solver that has been used previously to model both linear and toroidal devices will be used to model these experiments. Experiment-model comparisons will be undertaken under a wide range of conditions, from coherent to fully-developed turbulent states."
0.09,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is directed at the study of the quark structure of nucleons and nuclei. Research will be carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory as part of a collaboration called STAR. This collaboration is focused on the scattering of high energy polarized protons from nuclei with the goal of understanding the structure of the proton. The proposed research will use the forward electromagnetic calorimeter, called FMS, which is part of the STAR detector system to measure neutral particles that are produced at small scattering angles. The measured rates of such particle production have been found to depend strongly on the direction of polarization of the proton beam, an effect that has confounded attempts at a theoretical understanding based on the fundamental theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Further studies of this particles detected using the FMS will guide future theoretical develpments and help us to understand more about the quark and gluon structure of nucleons.<br/><br/>This proposal supports the Penn State group to operate the FMS detector in the STAR experiment for polarized proton RHIC runs and to analyze data from those runs. The STAR FMS is an electromagnetic calorimeter that detects collision fragments produced in the forward pseudo-rapidity region. Particles observed in this region are associated with the interactions of the most energetic and most polarized quarks. For transversely polarized protons, the large dependence of the cross section on the sign of polarization is a long-standing mystery. While the QCD Lagrangian is known, our ability to use it to predict observables is still limited. In contrast to the electromagnetic force, where the role of spin constituents of an atom is fairly well understood, the role of spin among the partons (constituents of a bound state proton) remains near our knowledge frontier. The most useful model for scattering by the QCD force is perturbative QCD, or pQCD, which is applicable when the collisions between protons constituents exchange large momentum. The goal of this research is to determine experimentally where pQCD applies and how to modify models to extend applicability."

0.1,"A complete understanding of the internal structure of protons, neutrons and other strongly interacting subatomic particles remains elusive. Although Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the relevant part of the Standard Model of particle physics, is an established theoretical framework, it is extremely difficult to perform calculations for phenomena that extend over large distances such as the size of the proton. Lattice-QCD, a numerical first-principles technique that relies heavily on high-performance computational resources, is able to calculate accurately only certain properties of particles such as protons and neutrons. For other properties, researchers rely on physically well-motived phenomenological models. In this broader context, the investigator and his students will develop and apply improved QCD models to study the distribution of constituent quarks and gluons in subatomic particles, such as pions, kaons, and protons. These efforts provide theoretical support to ongoing experimental efforts at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Graduate students involved in this research will be trained in theoretical nuclear physics and will have the opportunity to work on research problems at the forefront of nuclear science, thereby receiving training that prepares them for entering the much-needed workforce in the nuclear science arena. <br/><br/>The Dyson-Schwinger equations approach to nonperturbative model building in QCD preserves the short distance renormalization group behavior of QCD, while modeling in the infrared domain is guided by an empirical approach that preserves the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking known to generate at least 98% of the mass of visible stable matter in the universe. This approach is checked against established results of Lattice-QCD and is used to extend and complement Lattice-QCD for domains where lattice results are not presently available. This work will analyze and interpret experimental results about the quark and gluon structure of sub-atomic particles and elastic and transition form factors. This project will also develop an improved practical method for solving the QCD bound state equation for excited state mesons and will explore the limitations of a recently proposed approximate approach to parton distributions for Lattice-QCD."
0.38,"This award supports a nuclear physics experimental project at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. The goal of the experiment is a better understanding of the internal quark and gluon structure of the proton and neutron constituents of nuclear matter. The proposed research will provide fundamental information on the momentum distributions of the quarks inside the nucleons of the helium-3 and tritium atoms, using a new method of comparing directly measurements of inelastic electron scattering from helium-3 and tritium nuclei. This method is complementary to experiments done in the past at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, which showed the existence of point-like ""partons"" inside the nucleons, by scattering electrons from hydrogen and deuterium nuclei. The new method will eliminate inherent theoretical uncertainties in the Stanford method. The results will test long-standing predictions of the Quark Model of the nucleon, and of Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory describing the interactions between quarks and gluons. In addition, a new proposal will be prepared for a measurement of elastic electron scattering from the tritium nucleus, which will provide critical information for the development of a ""standard model"" describing the structure and dynamics of the simplest, lightest nuclei in nature. The project is expected to make significant contributions to the advancement of basic nuclear physics science, and to graduate education and training by offering doctoral dissertation topics on related science and instrumentation, which provide experience needed for careers in education, medical physics, homeland security, high technology, and national laboratories research.<br/><br/>The project will make use of a tritium, helium-3, and deuterium target system under development at Jefferson Lab, and magnetic spectrometers in the Hall A facility of the Lab. Unpolarized electrons with energy up to 11 gigaelectronvolt will be scattered from the above nuclear targets. For the inelastic measurements, scattered electrons will be detected with the electron High Resolution Spectrometer and a refurbished BigBite Spectrometer. The ratio of the measured cross sections for tritium and helium-3 will determine reliably the ratio of the neutron to proton structure functions, and subsequently the ratio of the probability distributions for an up quark compared to a down quark in the nucleon. The ratio of the tritium and helium-3 cross sections to the deuterium cross section will provide additional information about the effect of the nuclear environment on quarks in the nucleon. A comparison of the effect for these two mirror nuclei is considered to be essential for a full explanation of this effect. For the elastic measurements, the hadron High Resolution Spectrometer will be also used for detection of tritium recoiling nuclei. The two tritium form factors will be measured up to large momentum transfers by means of a Rosenbluth separation. This group will play a major role in all aspects of the project, namely the i) refurbishment, checkout, and calibration of the BigBite spectrometer, ii) preparation of all experimental apparatuses to be used, iii) acquisition of the experimental data, iv) data analysis, and v) publication of the results.

In terms of combustion, laser ignition has many potential benefits. For reciprocating natural gas engines one can ignite leaner mixtures (reducing NOx emissions and pollutant formation) and higher pressure mixtures (leading to higher engine efficiencies and fuel-savings).

The energy addition of the second pulse is enabled by pre-ionization due to the first pulse. The result will be a laser plasma that is not at full breakdown conditions (i.e. no spark), but that has elevated temperature (>~2000 K). Such laser plasmas can provide novel and improved ignition sources by avoiding the unnecessarily high temperatures, strong shock waves, and elevated laser pulse energies that accompany full laser breakdown (sparks). We will consider a range of pulse durations (ns-ps-fs) as well as both non-resonant and resonant schemes for pre-ionization.

0.344999,"Turbulence and turbulent transport of heat, momentum, and particles in the presence of spatially varying (sheared) flows are ubiquitous in fusion, space, and laboratory plasmas. It has been observed that when the shear in the flow -- either ""equilibrium"" ExB flows, or turbulent Reynolds stress self-driven (zonal) flows -- is sufficiently large, turbulence and/or turbulent transport can be reduced or suppressed. The high confinement mode (H-mode) widely observed in toroidal fusion devices is one example of such flow shear suppression. There has been a significant amount of work, including experimental, computational, and theoretical, on understanding the interactions between fully developed turbulence (and its associated transport) and flow shear. However, since the observed transitions to suppressed or reduced turbulence states typically occur on very fast time scales, little has been done experimentally to elucidate the detailed nonlinear dynamics of this transition. Because of the difficulty in observing the dynamics, a theoretical understanding of the transition is also lacking, since few detailed tests of models have been possible.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to improve the understanding of the detailed dynamics of transitions between states of unstable drift fluctuations (including broadband turbulence) and fluctuation-suppressed states in a controlled laboratory environment. Experiments, which are being conducted in the dual-source HelCat (Helicon-Cathode) device at the University of New Mexico (UNM), are investigating the effects of controlled magnetic shear and magnetic X-points on these dynamics, as well as the detailed effects of electrode biasing. These experiments are being complemented by direct comparisons with a fully nonlinear global Braginskii code, as well as other computational tools. The primary numerical code, a fully 3D global (full plasma equilibrium and fluctuations), is being used to model and understand both large-scale equilibrium flows and fluctuations. This code is complemented by a linear stability code, which will be used to interpret the nature of the fluctuations, and a 1D, 3V particle in cell (PIC) code to understand the details of the plasma potential profile as electrodes are biased to arbitrary voltages to affect flows.

0.095,"This project investigates the speculative possibility of storing energy in turbulent fluid eddies, and then suddenly releasing this energy. When gas is compressed, its temperature increases. However, the increase in temperature might be less if there are other degrees of freedom that absorb the energy. Suppose, for example, that the gas energy resides mainly in whirling eddies, rather than in completely random motion. We ask the question whether there are conditions under which compression of the gas might increase this eddy energy. The significance of this question is that energy in eddies acts differently than random energy because neighboring molecules tend to move in the same direction. That means that there would be fewer times that gas molecules would make high-impact head-on collisions. Important processes such as nuclear fusion depend on this relative motion, so the fusion reactions would be fewer in gases where the energy resides in whirling eddies rather than in random thermal motion. If this were true, then one might also speculate that the effect could be used advantageously in controlling nuclear fusion in a highly compressed plasma. <br/><br/>This project investigates the possibility of storing and then suddenly releasing the energy that can be deposited into turbulent fluid eddies in a plasma. It is conjectured that, under compression on a time scale in which viscosity may be neglected, the energy in such eddies might increase. Also, if the energy resides in hydrodynamic eddies rather than ion temperature, it means that it is unavailable to electrons through collisions. Thus, this energy cannot be easily captured by electrons and radiated. If the compression increases eddy energy more than the random energy, a new paradigm for storing energy in a highly compressed plasma might be advanced in which the energy content is increased under compression in a non-radiating plasma, and then suddenly released under viscous dissipation. To test these speculations, particle-in-cell simulations will be performed to describe compressing turbulent eddies, with guidance obtained from Z-pinch experiments that already appear to exhibit certain features of a turbulent inviscid plasma. This work will involve a collaboration between Princeton University and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and will be performed under the umbrella of the Memorandum of Understanding on Research Cooperation between NSF and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation.

Turbulence plays a key role in heating and accelerating the solar wind, which in turn mediates the interactions between the Sun and Earth's near-space environment. This project will thus ultimately contribute to the scientific community's ability to understand and model space weather, which includes disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field that have the potential to damage power grids. In addition, this project will contribute to the training of future scientists by supporting the research team's involvement in, and organization of, the annual Solar Heliospheric and INterplanetary Environment (SHINE) Workshop. This Workshop attracts roughly 200 attendees, of whom approximately 60 are students. The Workshop provides students with specialized training in space science and helps integrate students into the community of space-science researchers. The principal investigator of the project will teach in summer schools for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in the fields of plasma physics and space physics. The principal investigator will also incorporate research findings from this project into his teaching of physics and astronomy at the University of New Hampshire. These activities will contribute to the development of a strong science-technology-engineering-mathematics (STEM) workforce, which will benefit society at large.<br/><br/>The particular scientific focus of the project's turbulence research is on the phenomenon of intermittency and its effects upon solar-wind turbulence. Intermittency is a property of turbulent flows in which random fluctuations in, for example, the velocity of the medium (``eddies'') become concentrated into a decreasing fraction of the volume as the size of the eddies decreases. Intermittency profoundly impacts almost every aspect of solar-wind turbulence, from the rate at which it heats the interplanetary medium to the mechanisms by which turbulent energy is transferred to the different types of charged particles contained in the solar wind. To tackle this problem, the research team will employ a range of methodologies, including mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and they will test their theoretical predictions using spacecraft measurements."
0.01,"The Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) is an annual topical meeting of the American Physical Society sponsored under the auspices of the Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. It is the leading international conference in the science and technology of Low Temperature Plasmas (LTP) combined with collision physics (CP). The GEC combines aspects of atomic, molecular, and optical physics with low-temperature plasma physics, electric discharges, and plasma chemistry, as well as their technological applications. Fundamental topics addressed at the GEC include atomic and molecular collision cross sections, plasma diagnostics, ion and electron distribution functions, as well as kinetic, particle-in-cell (PIC), and fluid plasma modeling. The conference has been the venue of the first presentations on world leading developments in investigations of LTP and CP topics including advanced combustion systems, lighting and lasers, plasma materials processing of relevance to the semiconductor and photovoltaics industry, and plasma application in biomedicine. The invited speakers represent the world's leading scientists in these fields. The future of any field depends upon attracting bright young people. The GEC has a strong tradition of encouraging and promoting student participation, and has an enviable reputation of being the first conference where many of the leading members of the community presented their first research results as graduate students. <br/><br/>This award will pay partial travel support for 13 PhD students to attend and present the results of their work at the 68th Annual GEC meeting to be held Monday, October 12 - Friday, October 16, 2015 in Honolulu, Hawaii. This will be a joint meeting with the International Conference on Reactive Plasmas normally held in Japan. Hawaii was chosen as the venue since it is located roughly in the middle between the US mainland and Japan. These two distinct meetings are expected to attract more than 600 plasma scientists, collision physicists, and engineers to the same convention center. This award will provide the opportunity for PhD students to establish peer to peer collaboration with researchers from around the world. The GEC, being a moderate size conference, presents an environment where collaborate research efforts and future endeavors are often initiated. The students will have the opportunity to observe first-hand the scientific and cultural diversity of the field, and establish what will hopefully be career long collaborations with their international counterparts. The GEC makes a special effort to support graduate students who are women and underrepresented minorities."
0.14,"Quantum mechanics is an impressively successful theory that tells us how very small (atomic and subatomic) objects behave. Despite the success so far, quantum mechanics has important aspects that remain counterintuitive and require deeper understanding. One such aspect of current interest involves measurements on quantum systems. Fundamentally, when measuring some aspect of a quantum system, the system is disturbed by the measurement, such that other aspects of the system change in response to the measurement. The most famous example is ""Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,"" which, for example, states that when one has better knowledge of the position of an atom, one must necessarily have worse information about the atom's velocity. More generally, this disturbance effect goes by the name of ""quantum back-action."" The goal of this project is use ultracold atoms to observe and study several manifestations of quantum back-action that have been predicted theoretically. Broadly speaking, this research addresses the following questions: Under what conditions does back-action significantly influence the future of the system? Can precisely engineered back-action be useful as a tool to control the system? These questions are nontrivial, as back-action generally refers to a random disturbance to a quantum system. However, under carefully arranged conditions, the randomness of the back-action can control quantum systems in well-defined ways. This research will advance fundamental understanding of quantum mechanics, measurement, and information, and it will provide new tools that may be useful in future technologies such as quantum computers and precision-measurement devices for such quantities as acceleration and magnetic field, whose performance will ultimately be limited by quantum effects.<br/><br/>More specifically, the effects of quantum back-action on the dynamics of ultracold atoms will be studied in three separate scenarios. In the first scenario, a single trapped atom undergoes coherent transitions between two states when driven by a laser field. Spontaneous emission not only causes the atom to jump from the excited state to the ground state at random times, but also provides information about the present state of the atom. By selecting only the (random) cases where an atom does not spontaneously emit at all, the experiment is predicted to show that spontaneous emission nevertheless has an effect, via the relative probabilities for the atom to be in each state (i.e., the measurements should not be explainable by a theory that does not include spontaneous emission). In the second scenario, atoms confined to an optical lattice undergo spontaneous emission, which produces heating (momentum diffusion). Although momentum diffusion should increase the rate at which the atoms spread through the lattice, an interesting prediction is that for small spontaneous-emission rates, the atoms' spreading should be suppressed due to the inhibition of quantum tunneling. For larger spontaneous-emission rates, the spreading of the atoms should then again increase as expected. In the final scenario, a realization of the predicted ""blowtorch"" effect is to be realized with atoms in an optical lattice: by making a space-dependent ""temperature"" (spontaneous-emission rate) for the atoms, a pumping effect for the atoms (realized as a steady current of atoms) should be observable, demonstrating a fundamental effect in nonequilibrium thermodynamics."
0.095,"Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.<br/><br/>The PI effectively mentors junior faculty, including women and members of underrepresented minorities and is committed to enhancing diversity in STEM fields through participation in an NSF ADVANCE program. The project provides an excellent environment for students and postdocs, who are well-equipped to contribute to scientific and economic progress in academia, government, and industry. The award includes development of planetarium content on high energy astrophysics, cosmic rays, and neutrinos. This will bring the excitement of cutting-edge research to young students and the community.<br/><br/>IceCube incorporates an air shower detector, IceTop, a water Cherenkov detector which covers the energy range from 10^15 to 10^18 eV where hadronic interactions are better constrained by data from the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis work funded by this award focuses on the problem of disentangling the composition of the highest energy cosmic rays from hadronic interactions. The behavior of ultrahigh energy cosmic ray air showers is not well-described by current models of hadronic interactions. Resolution of this problem may result in transformative improvements in our understanding of interactions beyond the reach of terrestrial accelerators."
15.538,"The goal of the Center for Magnetic Self-Organization in Laboratory and Astrophysical Plasmas (CMSO), initiated in September, 2003, is to unite laboratory and astrophysical plasma scientists to advance critical plasma physics topics common to both fields. The sense of the CMSO research mission is captured by two large questions: Why is the universe magnetized? How do magnetic fields affect the structure of plasmas? CMSO encompasses and is organized around four, coupled processes: magnetic reconnection, dynamo effects, momentum transport, and magnetic turbulence. The heart of the effort is focused on answering fundamental questions in each area through experiment, computation, and theory, and applying the understanding to important astrophysical problems. <br/><br/>These physics problems are addressed by a team of scientists from seven institutions that collectively provide unique tools (seven experiments and an arsenal of computational resources) and great breadth of expertise from the lab to astrophysics, and from experiment to theory to computation. The member institutions are the University of Wisconsin, Princeton University and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of Chicago, the University of New Hampshire, Swarthmore College, and Science Applications International Corporation. Participating experiments include three toroidal plasma experiments that exhibit many features of self-organization: the MST reversed field pinch (Wisconsin) and two merging plasma experiments, MRX (Princeton) and SSX (Swarthmore); two linear experiments for line-tied reconnection: RSX (Los Alamos), RWX (Wisconsin); and two liquid metal experiments: the MRI experiment (Princeton) for studying the magnetorotational instability, and the Madison Dynamo Experiment. National laboratory participation (Los Alamos, Princeton) will be supported by DOE, as is the experimental infrastructure; thus, CMSO is very much a partnership between NSF and DOE. <br/><br/>The educational outreach program is based on The Wonders of Physics lecture-demonstration program through the University of Wisconsin. Under the auspices of this program CMSO representatives make over 100 presentations per year reaching an audience of school children and the general public of 10,000 persons per year. In the past year, presentations were made to 2000 African American children through specially targeted presentations and extensively to Native Americans and rural communities."
0.42,"In this project, the PI will focus on elucidating two important aspects of RNP liquids: 1) Their assembly from soluble components, and 2) Their material properties, which strongly impact their biological function. The PI will study the complexity of living cells by first taking a bottom-up approach, utilizing an in vitro system of purified components. This will be complemented by utilizing advanced microscopy and image analysis techniques, and novel molecular dynamics measurements. These combined in vitro/in vivo studies will allow the PI to understand the full complexity of RNP liquids, and test the hypothesis that the assembly and properties of these droplets are tuned by ATP-dependent biological activity. The broader impacts of this proposal include educating the next generation of biophysicists by providing laboratory research training at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels; at the undergraduate level, laboratory training for senior thesis research will play a key role. In the classroom, the PI will develop new courses on Quantitative Biology and Soft Living Matter. This teaching is part of the PI's broader effort to build the infrastructure for growing Princeton's nascent Bioengineering community, and couple it to the greater Biophysics community on campus and beyond. At the K-12 level, the PI has developed an outreach partnership with the Trenton public schools, which focuses on inspiring under-represented groups of 8th grade students from Kilmer Elementary School. The PI will visit the classroom for hands-on presentations on Soft Living Matter, and these students will visit the PI's laboratory. To evaluate the efficacy of this outreach, quantitative evaluation tools based on the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA) will be used, which the PI will implement and analyze together with a science education researcher.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.446,"Solar neutrino research has already discovered massive neutrinos and flavor mixing and is moving into an era where precision measurements can provide a unique probe of the structure and composition of the Sun. The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle is one of the fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, releasing electron-neutrinos. The CNO neutrino flux depends on the abundance of carbon in the core of the Sun. A measurement of the CNO flux would be the first direct measurement of the solar metallicity (the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium) in the core of the Sun. It could test the fundamental assumption of homogeneity in the Sun and provide crucial information regarding opacities in the solar interior that are important for helioseismology. Such studies could thus have a great impact on our understanding of the Sun, stellar astrophysics, the link between planetary and stellar formation, as well as basic neutrino physics. Borexino is a liquid scintillator detector, located at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, with a unique sensitivity to solar neutrinos.<br/><br/>The Borexino research program has involved many undergraduate and graduate students. Mentoring and training these younger researchers from Princeton and other schools is a high priority. The group is actively promoting women in science through Princeton Women in Physics.<br/><br/>This award provides funding for the Princeton U. group to continue to improve the sensitivity and to assist in the operation of the Borexino detector. Borexino's sensitivity to solar neutrinos is due primarily to the extremely low background made possible after reducing backgrounds in the liquid scintillator by re-purification. The methods and equipment for purification operations were provided by Princeton, as was the staff that managed the operations. Further reduction of the scintillator background is possible with modest improvements of the purification system and with the additional scintillator purification operations planned here. With these changes, Borexino will be in a good position to make the first measurement of CNO neutrinos. Future data with lower background will also result in improvements of the earlier Borexino measurements of pp, pep, Be-7, and B-8 neutrinos. The future measurement of all solar neutrinos will map out with higher sensitivity the vacuum-to-matter-effect dependence of neutrino oscillations on the neutrino energy, as well as search for non-standard interactions."
0.179109,"A remarkable feature of quantum physics is the non-locality of information. Quantum information can be encoded not only in individual bits or atoms, but also in the correlations amongst many atoms. Such correlations -- or ""entanglement"" -- may one day offer profound benefits for computation and precision sensing technologies. While the potential benefits of entanglement multiply with increasing particle number, so do the challenges of manipulating and preserving it. One key difficulty is that the naturally occurring interactions among atoms are local, i.e., an atom ordinarily interacts only with other atoms that are very near it. In this project, we will engineer a new type of interaction that is non-local and can thus entangle many spatially separated atoms. We will employ laser light as a messenger for conveying information between these atoms to generate entanglement. A crucial challenge is to convey this information discreetly, without letting it leak to the surrounding environment; otherwise, the delicate quantum mechanical system would be perturbed by the mere act of observation. Addressing this challenge will require a customized experimental apparatus, which graduate and undergraduate students will construct and operate, thereby acquiring valuable technical and analytical problem-solving skills. The educational impact will be extended to students from a local two-year college through summer internships designed to broaden participation in the science and engineering workforce.<br/><br/>This project focuses on engineering light-mediated spin-spin interactions among laser-cooled atoms. The primary motivation is to enable the study of novel many-particle entangled states emerging from beyond-mean-field collective spin dynamics. By strongly coupling many atoms to a single mode of light in an optical resonator, we will generate interactions that are highly coherent, controllable, and non-local. By furthermore combining non-local interactions with local addressing, we will harness a single quantum bit non-linearity to manipulate the many-particle collective spin. The ease of tuning and quenching light-mediated interactions, as well as varying the strength and form of dissipation, will enable investigations of the emergence of entanglement in a quantum phase transition or in quantum chaotic dynamics. Sensitive, resonator-aided measurements will enable detailed quantum-state characterization, including tomographic reconstruction into a phase-space representation allowing for visual comparison of quantum dynamics with corresponding classical trajectories."
0.45,"This research will investigate quantum phase transitions using ultracold atomic gases cooled close to absolute zero temperature. Phase transitions play important roles in many areas of physics including cosmology, particle physics and condensed matter. The freezing of water to ice provides a familiar example: the motion of water molecules undergo a phase transition upon crystallization as the temperature falls below the freezing point. In cosmology, it is conjectured that the large scale structure of the universe is a vestige of defects (e.g. ""cosmic strings"") formed as the Universe cooled through a phase transition (via the so-called ""Higgs mechanism"") shortly after the Big Bang. This research will explore quantum phase transitions and associated phenomena in an unexplored regime at the opposite end of the temperature scale, close to absolute zero on the Kelvin temperature scale (or nearly 460 degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit temperature scale). The experiments will use ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (a quantum state of matter that forms at extremely low temperatures) to explore phase transitions in which the behavior of the transition is determined by quantum effects rather than thermal effects. In addition to providing new insight to the fundamental quantum science of many-particle systems, these experiments have potential applications to quantum information science and to the development of new quantum sensors for inertial guidance and measurement of gravity and magnetic fields. <br/><br/>This experimental research will study strongly interacting ensembles of spin-1 atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate to explore the nature of quantum phase transitions in the neighborhood of the critical point and to investigate creation, control and characterization of non-classical highly entangled states of the ensembles. The investigations use small rubidium-87 atomic Bose-Einstein condensates containing just a single spin domain, such that the dynamic evolution occurs only in the internal spin degrees of freedom. These condensates feature a well-characterized Hamiltonian with a tunable quantum phase transition that allow exploration of both ferromagnetic and polar (nematic) ground states of the spins. The combination of an exactly solvable Hamiltonian with a quantum phase transition together with demonstrated dynamics in the quantum regime provide a unique combination of tools to explore important topics including high precision studies of a second order quantum phase transitions, exploration of excitations across a quantum critical point, and the generation of massively entangled states. A common theme in all of these studies is the role of finite size effects that manifest in the quantum fluctuations of the system. This research will provide insight into fundamental principles of many-particle quantum mechanics that are important to many areas of physics and will point the way to future explorations of quantum many-body spin systems including thermalization and ergodicity crossing a quantum phase transition, investigations of Hamiltonian quantum chaos and other non-linear phenomena, and finite temperature effects."
0.4,"Although ninety-eight percent of the mass of ordinary matter is due to the strong nuclear force, the present theory of that force (Quantum Chromodynamics) is still not fully understood. This award supports the study of the strong nuclear force by probing the substructure of matter. Almost the entire mass of an atom is concentrated in its tiny nucleus, which is made of nucleons that are either positively charged (protons) or electrically neutral (neutrons). These subatomic particles, however, are not elementary but are themselves composite objects made of quarks held together by glue particles (gluons). The structure of nucleons is a manifestation of the strong nuclear force, which is the strongest force known. This research will help advance discovery and understanding in nuclear physics, and promote teaching, training, and learning. The preparation of junior scientists plays a central role in the supported activities.<br/><br/>The nuclear physics research program at the University of South Carolina (USC) is mainly based at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. There, the group uses high-energy electron and photon beams along with sophisticated particle detectors that were developed, in part, at USC as powerful microscopes to study the subatomic world. The group is also preparing the MUSE experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. This experiment will address the proton-radius puzzle by scattering muons and electrons off the proton. Through detector development, simulations, management of complex experiments, and data analyses, they will shed light on some of the most profound questions like: What is the structure of the nucleon? What are and how can we excite its internal degrees of freedom? Once excited, in which way does the nucleon decay back to its original state? Does the structure of the nucleon change if it is embedded in dense nuclear matter? The experimental study of these properties gives insight into the nature of the strong force and allows for rigorous tests of the underlying theory."
2.711194,"Overview<br/>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM).<br/><br/>The LHC is the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator in the world and is currently operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. It is one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions.<br/><br/>Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) is the first experiment designed specifically to study the decays of hadrons containing beauty or charm quarks at a hadron collider. The goal of LHCb is to identify new physics in nature by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. New physics, or new forces, are manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered. These particles would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries, and thus allow new phenomena to be observed indirectly. In direct searches for new particles, the accelerators' energy must be high enough to allow the particle to be produced. In indirect searches effects of new particles can be seen even if they have a much higher mass than can be seen directly, because the effects are quantum in nature, and appear in calculations where the particles are ""virtual"" so they are emitted and absorbed over short times. LHCb has operated very successfully starting in late 2010. The data are being analyzed and published. The experiment has shown many results, but none so far have clearly demonstrated new physics. LHCb has proposed an upgrade to be completed in the 2018-2019 time-frame when the LHC accelerator will not be running. This upgrade will allow LHCb to collect an order of magnitude more data in decay modes that will either show new physics or severely restrict the allowed mass range. LHCb is comprised of about 10 different sub-detectors or sub-systems. The Syracuse, Maryland, Cincinnati and MIT groups participating in this award have the responsibility of upgrading a part of the charged particle tracking system. The intent is to significantly enhance the capabilities of this system above and beyond the requirement that data can be taken at an order of magnitude higher luminosity.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The intellectual merit of this award is that it is part of an upgrade of LHCb that will allow a much more sensitive search for BSM physics. The main deliverable will be a new inner tracking device, the Upstream Tracker (UT). This device will increase the data throughput over the current tracking device by an order of magnitude, allowing the LHCb experiment to probe BSM physics. The UT, which replaces the current tracker, will consists of four planes of single-sided 250 micron thick silicon strip detectors, read out by a custom-made front-end electronic integrated circuit. With its reduced material budget and optimized segmentation as a function of the distance from the beam line, it plays a crucial role in reducing the rate of fake tracks and in providing fast momentum measurements in the residual field of the dipole magnet. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The broader impacts of this work span several areas. Undergraduate and graduate students will be direct participants in the construction and testing of the detector that will be constructed. For many years a steady stream of undergraduate and graduate students have been working in the PIs' laboratories, where it is a tradition to ensure that graduate students have both hardware experience as well as data analysis capabilities. The upgrade work will be integrated into the Syracuse Quarknet program to involve high school teachers and some of their better students as well. Test results from this detector will be discussed at conferences and published. This detector is an integral part of the LHCb Upgrade and is essential for LHCb to continue to produce cutting edge physics results."
0.075,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The measurements that will be carried out within this project will lead to a better understanding of nucleon structure and a better understanding of the effects of bound quarks moving at relativistic velocities. In particular, the proposed measurements will be used to extract detailed radial charge distributions of the proton and neutron, and will lead to a better understanding of how to interpret data from electron scattering experiments on nuclei. This project will train and support both undergraduate and graduate students, most of whom are minority students. The program is highly interdisciplinary. It includes work with both hardware and software i.e., electronics, nuclear detector systems, optics, computer simulation, and data analysis. Students engaged in the program will work in a state-of-the-art facility and interact with scientists from other nationally recognized universities. These research activities will significantly impact the training of the students, preparing them for entering the STEM workforce of the 21st century.<br/><br/>This grant is to support research activities at North Carolina A&T State University on two programs. The first is the nucleon Form Factors (FF) program in Hall A at Jefferson Lab which is dedicated to the measurement of the neutron electromagnetic form factor ratio in double polarized, quasi-elastic scattering on 3He, and separately the neutron magnetic form factor in quasi-elastic scattering off the deuteron, both at high momentum transfer. The second is to measure the neutron Electric Form Factor at high momentum transfer from a deuterium target via recoil polarimetry in Hall C at Jefferson Lab. Elastic electromagnetic Form factors of the nucleon (proton or neutron) provide key information on the structure and the composition nature, of the nucleon, and the dynamics of quarks and gluons. For the FF program the group will build a photon detector array for the Gas Ring Imaging Cherenkov counter. For the experiment of Hall C, the group is building the polarimeter veto counters and the Delta-E detector arrays that identify the recoil proton from the neutron scattering events in the polarimeter analyzer."
0.1,"Intense laser light may bring some of the science and applications of large particle accelerators down to a moderate-size laboratory, making it accessible to a broader range of researchers and users in multiple fields of science and technology. From the radiation physics perspective, an advantage of lasers is their ability to generate unprecedentedly short (attosecond) pulses of ultraviolet and x-ray radiation. Even though the spatial scales are drastically different, the physics of emission by electrons in large-scale synchrotron facilities (major research tools for x-ray crystallography and materials science research) and by electrons undergoing acceleration at the surface of a solid under the influence of extreme-intensity light fields are, in an essential way, the same. The interaction of intense, ultrashort-pulsed light with solids results in target ionization and the momentary formation of something akin to a nanometer-sized ""synchrotron"" (the charged particles emit bursts of high-energy radiation within time intervals much shorter than the half-cycle of the driving light field). This process can be controlled by the details of how the incident light field waveforms evolve with time. Taming synchrotron-type electron trajectories in solids by specially prepared laser fields, and ensuring that the result is the emission of intense ultraviolet and x-ray radiation is the aim of this program.<br/><br/>This program will explore the chance to enhance the intensity of coherent ultraviolet and x-ray emission from solids under extreme light fields by sub-cycle shaping of the driving laser pulse waveforms. The waveform shaping can be achieved through mixing the laser fundamental frequency with its second harmonic or higher frequency components. The effect of the energy distribution of different colors in the driving field as well as the phase delay between them on the radiation spectra will be studied. The program will seek the optimized solutions for driving waveforms, as well as the physical limits on the efficiency of the process. This study may provide new insight into the dynamics of field-controlled electron oscillations in laser-produced solid-density plasmas. Ultimately, this approach may offer higher attosecond pulse intensities than those currently achieved, opening a pathway to advance ultrafast metrology toward time-resolved x-ray pump-probe spectroscopy."
0.1,"This research is part of a large effort in the Hall A experimental research area at Jefferson Laboratory. Our scientific interest is to help constrain the so-called ""equation of state"" of nuclear matter, a critical ingredient to understanding the makeup of dense stars. We do this by scattering a beam of polarized electrons from the nuclei of lead atoms, where the dependence of the scattering probability on polarization direction tells us the average distribution of neutrons in this large, spherical nucleus. The contribution funded here is for a precision apparatus that would tell us the degree of polarization of the electron beam. Such an apparatus is also critical for a large number of different experiments in Hall A, and is consequently a service to the nuclear physics community. The scientific impact on the nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics communities is very large, and the work is carried out with a number of students in various disciplines, at different levels. Consequently, students gain training not only in nuclear physics, but in magnetic transport applications and precision engineering, both as undergraduates and graduate students."
0.112914,"Central to the survival of many organisms is their ability to manipulate inorganic molecules into elaborate crystalline structures such as skeletons, teeth, and protective shells. This ubiquitous process of ""biomineralization"" depends on the precise action of specialized proteins within cells to form minerals where they are needed and prevent their accumulation in sensitive tissues. Although progress has been made, much is not understood about how biomineralization is realized inside of individual cells and which genes control the process. This collaborative project will address this challenge by applying recent advances in magnetic imaging technology to detailed studies of biomineralization in a simple and well-controlled biological system: the production of nanoscale magnetic particles within magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), and the use by MTB of chains of these particles (known as magnetosomes) for orientation and travel along the Earth's magnetic field lines (known as magnetotaxis). During this project, students and postdoctoral researchers will receive training in scientific practices at the interface of the physical and life sciences. In addition, the project may inform the development of improved materials with broad practical relevance, as products of biomineralization have superior properties compared to those currently engineered by humans.<br/><br/>The scientific goals of this project are to study the molecular mechanisms governing biomineralization and the development of magnetic nanoparticles in MTB. The studies will employ a ""diamond magnetic imager"" that exploits a nanoscale layer of quantum sensors at the surface of a diamond chip, enabling imaging of magnetic field patterns from individual MTB in a population under ambient laboratory conditions, with better than 50 nanometer spatial resolution and greater than 1 millimeter field-of-view. The investigators will apply the diamond magnetic imager to studies of magnetic nanoparticle growth in various MTB species and biomineralization mutants. The project will open a new window onto the physical processes enabling magnetotaxis, including the transition of magnetic nanoparticles from a superparamagnetic to a stable single-domain magnetic state during magnetic nanoparticle growth, and the role of interactions between magnetic nanoparticles within individual MTB. Magnetic measurements on genetic mutants will provide biological insights into the genes controlling the biomineralization process. Observations will also be made of the dynamics of the magnetic nanoparticle chain during the cell division cycle, both through time series magnetic measurements on different MTB as well as magnetic imaging of individual living MTB."
0.466,"Our experimental program explores spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of sodium atoms. Unique properties of the quantum fluid derive from its antiferromagnetic interactions, features that lead us to explore the rich frontier area between ultracold atoms and correlated electronic materials. Unlike its ferromagnetic cousin, rubidium-87, the sodium BEC in an optical trap possesses a nematic order parameter. A novel non-destructive imaging scheme is proposed to uncover the spatial dependence of this order, based upon detection of spin alignment rather than orientation. The spatial distribution of nematicity will be measured in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition mediated by the quadratic Zeeman Effect. The method will be used to examine both the dynamics of spatial fluctuations, including the nucleation of quantum half-vortices, as well as the structure of the equilibrium ground state. The antiferromagnetic interactions motivate us to experimentally realize and explore the limits to motional decoherence in a perfectly miscible two-component BEC. Finally, in a two dimensional antiferromagnetic BEC a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition is predicted that is mediated by bosonic pairs of atoms with non-trivial spin (anti)-correlations.<br/><br/>Magnetism is intimately connected to spin. In a gas of atoms cooled to near absolute zero the spins of the individual atoms interact with one another to create ordered states - ferromagnetic if the magnetic moments are aligned with each other, or antiferromagnetic if the moments tend to oppose one another. In an antiferromagnet, the spins choose an axis in space and arrange themselves to point both positively and negatively along that axis, so that the total magnetic moment is zero. The energy difference between antiferromagnet and ferromagnet, if it were expressed as a temperature, is only a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero. Remarkably, we can experimentally distinguish between these two states, so the atoms are expressing their preference very strongly indeed. Our research will examine how an antiferromagnet reorders its axis of alignment in response to an external magnetic field. This is known as a phase transition, analogous to what happens to a liquid as the temperature increases to near its boiling point. In our gas, however, the transition is not mediated by thermal effects, but by quantum mechanics. Quantum phase transitions, as these are known, occur in many solid state materials, including superconductors, and our research can shed light on their properties. Apart from fundamental interest, they could lead to new devices that exploit the laws of quantum mechanics such as topological quantum computers."
0.180956,"While atoms have been long recognized as the building blocks of the world we see and the environment we live in, their behavior at low temperatures has never ceased to surprise us. Examples include superfluids that flow without friction and quantum magnetic materials that permit read, write and storage of ample information. A recent work led by the principal investigator showed that both superfluidity and ferromagnetism (the type of magnetism in bar magnets) manifest simultaneously in atoms when shaken back and forth by laser beams, like ping-pong balls riding the ripples on a lake. The intriguing dynamics of magnetic domains observed in the atomic superfluids suggests new strategies to efficiently store and process information in the quantum regime. The major science goal of this project is to simulate and study a new type of 4-pole magnet in a two-dimensional lattice, which promises much richer properties than the 2-pole (south and north pole) magnetism in conventional materials. The science program is complimented by an extensive outreach effort under the S.M.A.R.T. (Science, Mathematics, And Research Training) project. <br/><br/>The proposed 4-pole magnetic phase will arise when an atomic superfluid is transferred into a two-dimensional shaken optical lattice, generated by overlapping two perpendicular optical standing waves. When the shaking amplitude is carefully tuned above a critical value, the superfluid is anticipated to split into 4 poles with ferromagnetic interactions. The formation of the 4-pole domain will be detected and studied by direct in situ imaging of the atomic sample. Compared to the conventional 2-pole magnets, the 4-pole magnets offer novel domain and vertex structures and are uniquely related to the four-color theorem in graph theory and the Potts model of statistical physics. Furthermore the phase transition into the ferromagnetic phase is associated with a variety of quantum phenomena, including Rashba superfluids, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, and the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Exploration of this quantum physics may have both academic and practical payoffs, including the development of a theoretical framework to understand quantum critical dynamics, simulations of N-pole ferromagnetic magnets, fabrication of programmable magnetic materials, and potentially even quantum information storage and processing."
0.09,"Precise experimental tests of fundamental particle properties are now a well-established way to search for new laws of nature beyond our current physical knowledge. The Standard Model of particle interactions describes known fundamental particles and their interactions. However, the Standard Model in its simplest form does not include a nonzero mass of the neutrino, for which there is now experimental proof. This calls for a continued effort to improve the Standard Model, and to further our knowledge of neutrino properties and interactions. Neutrino scattering from the nucleus, which leaves the nucleus intact, was first described some forty years ago, but still lacks an experimental demonstration. An accurate measurement of this mode of neutrino interaction, as planned here, will provide a handle on several still unconstrained neutrino properties, contributing information that helps to formulate refinements to the Standard Model.<br/><br/><br/>This research will use sodium-doped cesium iodide scintillators as an advantageous target for the detection of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering, exploiting the intense neutrino yield from the Spallation Neutron Source facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The response of this material to low-energy nuclear recoils, like those expected from this process, has been characterized and a full feasibility test has been performed using a 2 kg low-background prototype crystal in a dedicated radiation shield. Based on these studies, a planned 14 kg detector is expected to measure approximately 550 events per year from this mode of neutrino interaction. The still unmeasured neutron-generating charged-current neutrino interaction on Pb-208, of interest in nuclear physics and for supernova detection, will also be studied during the period of the award."
0.299999,"Flying snakes of the genus Chrysopelea glide like no other animal. Without appendages or membranes to use as lift-generating surfaces, flying snakes flatten from head to tail and glide using the body as a single ""wing"". In the air, the snakes simultaneously send traveling waves down the body while oscillating in the vertical plane, a flight behavior unlike any other found in the natural or engineering world. This project aims to understand the mechanisms that explain the unique flight abilities of flying snakes. Gliding in live snakes will be recorded to determine their detailed body movements and sectional shapes, including experiments to understand how snakes remain stable and maneuver in the air. Physical and computational models will be used to understand how the snake's shape and continuously changing body posture contribute to the production of aerodynamic forces for weight support and stability. Additional theoretical and physical models will be developed to investigate the requirements for producing snake-like locomotion in the air. <br/><br/>The subject of this study is an exciting topic for students and the broader public, and the proposed research will additionally serve as a springboard for new initiatives that integrate physics, biology, and engineering into novel educational programming. Animal groups that fly have been tremendously successful in the biological world, and yet no clear picture has emerged to explain how powered flight has evolved from terrestrial species. In particular, we lack an understanding of how species have transitioned from static gliding to active flapping flight. The undulating movements of the gliding snake, which can be considered as a continuously morphing wing, present characteristics that bridge from passive gliding to powered flight. The flying snake is an active glider, representing the only functional intermediate across the spectrum of gliding to flapping flight. Understanding the mechanics of gliding flight in snakes will therefore lend insight into how one group of species has successfully overcome the biomechanical challenges resulting from shifting forces and rotational torques on the body, a similar problem associated with active flapping flight. Additionally, the aerodynamics of flight at low Reynolds number has received far less attention than the flight dynamics of larger engineered flyers, and this project will elucidate how a craft with symmetrical airfoil shape, but asymmetrical and dynamic body posture, can be physically advantageous. Specifically, the unexpected aerodynamic performance of the snake may originate in its ability to ""surf"" on its own wake. The determination of muscle activity patterns during perturbation and turning trials will provide the first evidence of the neuromuscular control system required for this type of undulating flyer. In combination, the proposed research to understand how snakes glide will provide contributions across disciplines and will potentially lead to the development of novel micro-air vehicles. <br/><br/>Gliding flight in snakes is perhaps one of the most spectacular behaviors in the natural world, and has the potential to inspire new generations of students to take interest in STEM fields. This project taps into the natural appeal of this animal to develop new educational content for teachers and the public. Two major synergistic initiatives will be launched based on flying snake research. The first creates exciting, web-based multi-media material that can be easily adapted and used by teachers across educational levels. The new material will include informative video developed in collaboration with a professional television producer with years of experience creating programs for the National Geographic Channel. The second effort will use research in this project to create a new museum exhibit on flying snakes at the Science Museum of Western Virginia, with assistance from a public school teacher to help translate research into pedagogy. This exhibit will be offered for adaptation at museums worldwide, including the integration into a new exhibit on biomechanics at the Field Museum in Chicago. In addition to the global reach of these efforts, the appeal of flying snakes will be used as a mechanism to recruit underrepresented students into research at the undergraduate and graduate levels through targeted recruiting and visits to local universities with traditionally underserved student populations."
0.218035,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.<br/><br/>This award will provide funds for three activities:<br/>-- The SuperCDMS Soudan experiment is currently taking data which will have world-leading sensitivity to dark matter for masses below 5 gigaelectronvolt (GeV). The experiment will continue taking data next year, and the full set of different analyses of the data will take place over the next two years. MIT has taken a leadership role in the low-threshold analysis, and will continue to do so. <br/>-- Play a central role in the design, prototyping, testing, and commissioning of the next-generation experiment. <br/>-- Develop and prototype new low-threshold, low-background detectors with enough sensitivity to cover all the available dark matter parameter space for masses between 1-10 GeV down to the irreducible background from solar neutrinos.<br/><br/>This award will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, continuing the group's strong involvement in mentoring undergraduates from underrepresented groups by participating in the MIT Summer Research Program."
17,"Cosmology and particle physics stand at a crossroads. In recent years, scientists have put together a remarkably successful model of cosmic evolution and the extraordinarily well tested Standard Model of elementary particles. In the current cosmological model, a rapid burst of expansion - inflation - occurred a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang, laying the seeds for the formation of structure in the Universe. Those seeds have been observed as hot and cold regions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The assembly of galaxies from those seeds and the vast web of large-scale structure seen in galaxy surveys was shaped by dark matter, which dominates the mass in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the evidence that the cosmic expansion is now accelerating has become incontrovertible, pointing to a Universe dominated by dark energy or else to a modification of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.<br/><br/>The success of the current cosmology rests upon its three mysterious pillars - inflation, particle dark matter, and dark energy - mysterious because they lie outside the Standard Model of particle physics. Cosmology has shown that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that there is new physics waiting to be discovered. In the coming decade, cosmology can help reveal the new physics underlying inflation, dark matter, and cosmic acceleration, and thereby play a critical role in pointing the way to a new paradigm for fundamental physics. The Physics Frontier Center at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) will bring together astronomers and physicists, theorists, observers and experimentalists, and early-career scientists and senior researchers from across the cosmology community. Since the complexity of these problems requires multiple, complementary approaches, the Center will enable datasets from different experiments to be combined in powerful new ways. As new discoveries are made, the Center will pursue new directions to promptly follow them up. <br/><br/>Building upon the accomplishments, investments, and lessons learned over the past ten years of PFC funding, the Center focuses upon reaping the science from the projects that were initiated and developed at the KICP - South Pole Telescope (SPT), Dark Energy Survey (DES), Q/U Imaging Experiment (QUIET), and Chicagoland Observatory for Underground Particle Physics (COUPP) - and elsewhere to help solve these big mysteries. Built around the projects, the Center includes eight Major Activities (MAs), five research Hubs, an international Fellows exchange program, yearly hands-on summer schools, and multiple Education & Outreach partnerships. Twenty-one key collaborators have committed to carrying out specific tasks central to the Center. They come from local institutions, education and outreach partners, institutions around the country, and industry. <br/><br/>Three science MAs are devoted to our research themes: the Inflation MA will take advantage of dramatic advances in measuring CMB polarization to pursue the ""Bmode"" polarization signature of inflation-produced gravity waves, focusing initially on QUIET and SPTpol while laying the groundwork for future experiments. It will also combine CMB and large-scale structure measurements from DES to test whether the underlying density perturbations are Gaussian, as predicted by the simplest models of inflation. The Dark Energy MA will use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) and other future projects to probe the physical origin of cosmic acceleration and test the current paradigm - vacuum energy within Einstein's theory of gravity. The Dark Matter MA will synthesize the upcoming wealth of data from particle colliders, satellites, and ultra-sensitive dark matter detectors to confirm or refute the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) hypothesis for dark matter.<br/><br/>Within the three science MAs, five research ""Hubs"" will bring people and projects together to focus on specific challenges. The CMB Polarization Hub will facilitate coordination between different polarization experiments, including joint analysis; the non-Gaussianity Hub will bring together international researchers to constrain or detect non-Gaussianity and test inflation. The Joint Analysis Hub will bring together researchers on SPT and DES and other projects to develop and apply new tools to exploit and optimize galaxy clusters as probes of dark energy; the Supernova Hub will carry out a broad program to improve supernovae as cosmological distance indicators and apply these techniques to new surveys. The Dark Matter Hub will focus on particle theory and model building and signals for dark matter from colliders and indirect detection experiments, complementing the direct detection experiment COUPP and others.<br/><br/>The Fellows MA is the centerpiece activity of the Center. Mentored by the faculty of the Center but given great independence, eleven early-career scientists will be able to shape research programs of their own design, work with faculty, other Fellows, students, and visitors in the interdisciplinary environment of the Center. They can also participate in an international Fellows exchange program and choose from a broad range of opportunities in education and outreach. All of this is designed to prepare them to be future leaders in cosmology.<br/><br/>Two MAs are devoted to crosscutting, science-enabling activities. Detector Development, strongly leveraged by partnerships with Argonne, Fermilab, and other institutions, will develop innovative detectors to position us to take advantage of early discoveries and to broadly benefit cosmology and other areas of science. Computational Cosmology will coordinate the high-performance computing resources, both human and hardware, necessary to accomplish our science goals. The Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will provide a program of specialized workshops, large symposia, yearly hands-on summer schools, and a visitors program featuring the David Schramm Distinguished Visiting Professorship to engage and benefit the broader cosmology community and further our science goals.<br/><br/>By design, the broader impacts of the PFC are woven throughout the Center activities. More specifically, the Education, Outreach, & Diversity MA, will spearhead and coordinate a series of activities aimed at broadening the impact of the Center. This MA is strongly coupled to the science in the Center, involves 100% of the PFC faculty members, and has three overarching goals: increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce through programs from K-12 to the professoriate; educating and preparing the next generation of teacher-scholars in an interdisciplinary environment by involving students and Fellows directly in outreach and teaching activities; and advancing the public's understanding and appreciation of science through collaborations with museums and planetariums, and through public lectures and events. This approach to broadening participation includes collaboration with Project Exploration working with the Chicago Public Schools, continuation of the successful Space Explorers K-12 program, partnering with the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge program and the University of Texas El Paso to bring students to UChicago for research experiences, supporting and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and championing diversity in faculty hiring and retention within the Physical Sciences Division at UChicago. The Center will also use technology, developing visualization tools, to integrate research into the undergraduate curriculum and will partner with the Adler Planetarium on cosmology visualizations for a broader audience. Finally, the Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will promote dissemination of cutting-edge research to the broader cosmology community and offer opportunities for those not currently engaged in cosmology research to transition into the field."
0.425,"Creating Bose condensates of polaritons in microcavity structures is now fairly routine. In addition, we now have structures which have very long polariton lifetime compared to their thermalization time, so that we can do experiments with equilibrated condensates of these particles. This project has three primary goals based on our ability to make long-lifetime polariton condensates. First, we plan to use a polariton condensate to create enhanced two-photon absorption. In principle, this enhancement can be so much that the two-photon absorption process becomes deterministic even for sets of two single photons. This would have immediate impact in the area of quantum optics. The second main goal is to map the phase diagram of an equilibrium polariton condensate as a function of density and temperature, with emphasis on the changes of the spectral function of the condensate, which is immediately observable to us. In addition, we plan to create intersecting beams of ballistic polaritons, which would allow us to do many polariton-polariton scattering studies.<br/><br/>Bose condensation is a ubiquitous effect in which many particles spontaneously organize to act collectively as a single wave. The most well known example of this is a gas of atoms at ultra-low temperatures, but the effect occurs in other systems as well. In recent years, it has been shown to occur at moderate temperatures (tens of Kelvin) with particles called ""polaritons"", which are essentially photons that have been given atom-like properties, namely mass and weak interactions, by means of a specially designed optical system. A main goal of this project is to use a Bose condensate of polaritons to manipulate the transmission of infrared photons. If this goal succeeds, we will have a system in which one photon passing through the system will be unaffected, but two photons passing through together will be absorbed. This ability to manipulate single photons can be used in a number of schemes of quantum optical communications. The project will be tremendous experience for graduate students working on the project to do cutting edge optics research."
0.148208,"This research uses an innovative hybrid ion-neutral atomic particle trap developed by the PI's group as a tool for observing reactions and collisions of low energy ions with atoms cooled by lasers to near absolute zero temperature (~0.001 Kelvin). The cold atoms within a magneto-optic trap (MOT) can be used to refrigerate a co-trapped sample of atomic or molecular ions to study ion-atom interactions at temperatures approaching that of space. Cold, trapped Na+ and Ca+ atomic ion, and Na2+ molecular ion reaction rates with ultracold sodium (Na) atoms will be measured, as well as the rates of sympathetic collisional cooling, using the hybrid trap. The research has technical applications to precision spectroscopy, fundamental constants, astrophysical processes in the solar system and interstellar medium, atomic ion clocks and quantum computing. The ion-neutral hybrid trap combines two separate but spatially overlapped and concentric traps: a MOT and a Paul radiofrequency ion trap. Specifically, the project will involve direct experimental measurements of the absolute electron-exchange rate constant between Na and Ca+, investigating its dependence on collision energy and ionic and/or atomic excited-state populations. The rates will be compared with simulations. The resonance radiation absorption spectrum of trapped Ca+ ions will be investigated as a temperature probe of the trap as will the possibility of forming small lattices of confined, ionic Coulomb ""crystals"" inside the trap by using sympathetic cooling collisions, rather than traditional laser cooling.<br/><br/>A graduate student completed his Ph.D. in experimental atomic physics under the previous NSF grant and two additional Ph.D. level students expect to complete their ongoing dissertation research under the new grant. An undergraduate physics-mathematics student worked on simulations during the previous grant, as well as two M.S.-level exchange students from the University of Heidelberg, who did experimental work. Both undergraduate and graduate physics students participate in independent study work on this project. Students receive a broad education in basic experimental techniques of atomic and molecular physics: laser and collisional cooling and trapping at high vacuum (conditions resembling those of space), as well as cold ion manipulation, trapping, detection and laser spectroscopy. The PI gave an invited talk on this hybrid trap research in 2013 at a symposium on the Sao Carlos campus of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, attended by 5 physics Nobel Laureates. Research results are frequently presented in publications and at local, national and international meetings."
0.908,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter (protons and neutrons) represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of large backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. However, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the galaxy, yielding a day-night modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. Of current searches with directional detectors, the Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment is a leader, having a decade of experience. The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in DRIFT's unique and powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. <br/><br/>These advances in background rejection, combined with the fact that further limit setting capabilities are hampered by the small volume of DRIFT-II, suggest that DRIFT should scale-up. This award will enable the collaboration to continue running DRIFT-II in the Boulby mine in England. In addition to running DRIFT-IId, these funds will provide hardware for a second detector, DRIFT-IIe.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of hardware and software experience. Finally, the DRIFT detector technology has promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments."
0.3975,"Of the fundamental forces, gravity is probably the one most familiar in everyday life, yet its physics is the least well understood. For one, it does not fit into the standard model of particle physics, which is based on quantum mechanics. In addition, the action of gravity in quantum mechanics has been relatively elusive to experimental measurement. One of the most important challenges in physics is thus to find new ways to investigate how gravity affects quantum systems. The group will give a demonstration of the so-called Aharonov-Bohm effect (AB effect) for gravity. In classical physics, the interaction between two objects can be described equivalently based on forces or on potential energies. Aharonov and Bohm, however, pointed out that in quantum mechanics, two objects can influence each other even if there are zero forces between them. This has been verified experimentally for electromagnetic forces and potentials. The group will construct a specialized apparatus to investigate whether there is an analogous Aharonov-Bohm effect for gravity. This will demonstrate that gravity affects a quantum system even when it does not cause any classical force; that knowledge of the classical gravitational force acting locally on a particle is not sufficient to predict the particle's quantum-mechanical behavior; and help develop a new way of measuring Newton's gravitational constant G. Paraphrasing R. P. Feynman, for a long time it was believed that potentials were not ""real"", since they could be replaced by force fields in the description of any observable phenomenon then known. However, the AB effect has established that potentials are real, and forces are slowly disappearing from the modern expression of physical law. The group is collaborating with industrial partners to apply the techniques developed in this work in the production of advanced inertial sensors for improved navigation and positioning.<br/><br/>The experiment will be based on laser-cooled cesium atoms held in an optical lattice, inside a special arrangement of two spherical masses that produce a ""W""-shaped gravitational potential. The atoms will be at extrema of the gravitational potential, so that there will be no net force between the spherical masses and the atoms. Nevertheless, the masses should cause a relative phase shift of the atomic matter waves. The group will experimentally demonstrate the distinguishing features of the AB effect, such as nonlocality and nondispersiveness. The optical lattice will be a standing wave inside a Fabry-Perot cavity, to control the optical wave-fronts and provide laser intensity enhancement."
0.419985,"The goal of this research project is to advance the understanding of physical properties of new nano-materials by applying modern mathematical techniques. The PI has new research projects, which will be attacked by using a) analytical and b) noncommutative geometric methods. This will lead to the development of new general techniques that can be applied to other fields as well. The materials stem from triply periodic constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces and their complements which form wire networks. This gives an effective theory for the Dirac equation on the CMC surface, the computation of the eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplace operator on the graph of the wire network, the probing of a previously found noncommutative/commutative duality and the study of noncommutative topological invariants and the analogue of the quantum Hall effect for the wire networks. The methods and tools that the PI will employ range from methods in noncommutative geometry, algebra and representation theory, singularity theory and differential geometry to condensed matter physics. The above projects will provide important insights from different perspectives into the mathematical and physical properties of new nanomaterials. This interdisciplinary effort brings together tools from mathematics and physics and fosters the dialogue between the two disciplines. The outcome may be useful in photovoltaics, leading to increased effectiveness of solar cells. <br/>The broader impact aspects of this project are inherent in its educational aspects and the subject matter of the proposed research which involves several fields of physics, as well as the interdisciplinary nature between the physical and mathematical sciences.

0.267705,"The goal of this research project is to advance the understanding of boundary effects and their underlying mathematical structures. The project deals with three models stemming from statistical physics. First, the two-species totally asymmetric exclusion process, is a discrete version of a system of two coupled Burgers equations. The PI proposes to determine a conjectured new sub-leading exponent of this system and to investigate the properties of the phase diagram in the presence of boundary terms. The second objective is the establishment of a correspondence between boundary terms in the boundary conformal loop model and the XX- and XXZ- quantum spin chains with boundary operators. The third subject is a Markov chain describing a growing and fluctuating interface in the presence of a wall. The PI will determine the critical exponent of boundary avalanches and investigate the connection to the discrete Boussinesq equation. The PI will employ methods ranging from Bethe-Ansatz to conformal field theory, finite-size scaling and Monte-Carlo simulations. The above projects will provide important insights into the theory of critical phenomena in the presence of boundary terms. The project is focused on three important areas, namely the role of boundaries in phase diagrams of statistical models, the classification of all boundary terms preserving conformal invariance in boundary conformal field theories and the influence of boundaries on Markov processes. There is also evidence that the outcome of the project will have implications for the theory of quantum computing. <br/><br/>Broader Impact.

0.12,"Einstein's theory of general relativity describes all gravitational interactions in the universe, ranging from the force that pulls a falling apple to the Earth, to the expansion of the Universe itself. The equations of general relativity - called Einstein's equations - are sufficiently complex so that they can be solved exactly only under very special circumstances. To understand the merger of two black holes, for example, and to predict the signals that we hope to observe soon with the LIGO gravitational wave observatory, requires computer simulations. This award supports research efforts aimed at developing methods and approaches for such computer simulations. In particular, the focus is on methods that are well suited for the self-consistent treatment of the gravitational forces in supernova explosions. These extremely energetic explosions play an important role in the evolution of the universe, even the development of life, lead to the formation of black holes or neutron stars, and yet we still lack a detailed understanding of the explosion mechanism. <br/><br/>The scientific goals of this research effort in numerical relativity include the development and implementation of numerical algorithms for the solution of Einstein's equations of general relativity, as well as their application in the numerical modeling of relativistic objects, in particular neutron stars and black holes. The focus of this work is methods in spherical polar coordinates, which have distinct advantages over Cartesian coordinates for many applications, including gravitational collapse, accretion disks, and supernova calculations. This is done in collaboration with colleagues at the Max-Planck-Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, on including these methods in relativistic astrophysics simulations with a state-of-the-art treatment of microphysical phenomena. Among the long-term goals are supernova simulations that adopt both these advanced microphysics methods and a self-consistent treatment of relativistic gravitational fields. These results will advance our understanding of these processes and will predict their observational signatures in neutrino, electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals. The latter will be important for the new generation of gravitational wave laser interferometers, including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO)."
0.15,"The present grant is devoted to the study of interactions among a few atoms and possible ways one can achieve quantum control in the regime of ultracold temperatures relevant for quantum gases. Few-atom systems pose some of the greatest challenges facing theorists in atomic physics because of the extremely nonperturbative nature of the interactions. The goal of the proposal is to develop the theoretical tools and explore the basic capabilities and implications of new types of resonances. The investigation will center on controlling the complex multichannel collision dynamics with electromagnetic or static external fields. <br/><br/>A specific aim of the present project is to explore the viability of using a laser field to change the interactions among three or four atoms. The work could potentially have unprecedented impact with far-reaching scientific and technological ramifications. The ability to change atomic behaviors and interactions will have key impact in the quantum control of chemical reaction dynamics. A deep understanding of the ultracold atom interactions will find applications in atomic clocks, quantum information science and for the exploration of many novel phases of matter.

First is the development of the next-generation CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) detector, including the operations of the first production tower CUORE-0 and the subsequent data analysis. The second goal is the R&D towards a large generic bolometer-based double-beta decay detector. The observation of exotic NDBDs would indicate that neutrinos are Majorana particles, i.e. they are their own anti-particles. The rate of the process is sensitive to the effective neutrino mass. CUORE promises to be one of the most sensitive NDBD experiments this decade.

0.1,"This theoretical project will support current searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Although the Standard Model has been successful in describing the elementary particles that make up most of known matter in the Universe, many questions still remain unanswered. The theoretical calculations by the investigator and his collaborators will support and suggest new avenues for low-energy experiments sensitive for signatures of new physics. A prominent such example is the proton radius puzzle, where measuring the proton radius using electrons gives different results than using muons. The PI will calculate corrections needed for the interpretation of the data and will study beyond the Standard Model hypotheses to explain the proton radius puzzle, along with suggesting new experiments for future testing of these ideas. Another example is the case of precision electron-proton scattering experiments with polarized electrons, where the PI will do calculations relevant to extensions of the initial experiments that may allow measuring properties of short-lived excited states of the proton and the possibility of comparing them to predictions based on the current theoretical understanding of the physics involved. Postdoctoral fellows and undergraduates will be trained and supported by this project.<br/><br/>One thrust of the project is to find corrections to the energy levels of muonic helium and deuterium due to the polarization of the nuclear cores by the near-by orbiting muons. Precise results are needed to evaluate the measured energy level data and interpret it in terms of radius discrepancies relative to corresponding measurements using electrons. Another thrust is to calculate two photon corrections to polarized electron scattering in the region where the Delta resonance, one of the short-lived proton excitations, exists. To study the Delta as an entity in itself, one produces it using one photon and then measures it almost immediately by a further scattering with a second photon. In this project, the PI will calculate the precision requirements needed to obtain reliably the size and magnetic parameters of the Delta meson."
0.08,"This project concerns a theoretical study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QPG), a state of matter thought to have occurred a few microseconds after the Big Bang. At that early stage of the Universe, quarks and gluons then combined to form the basic building blocks of nature, the hadrons that we observe in Nature today. This transition is being studied in ongoing experiments with heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This project will provide theoretical support to these experimental programs by calculating fundamental observables from first principles and systematically relating them to experimental measurements. By taking advantage of the unprecedented level of accuracy achieved in both theory and experiment, this project is expected to advance significantly our understanding of the QGP and will shed light on the nature of the phase transition and the degrees of freedom governing the mechanism of hadronic matter formation. The project will involve students in an international research activity addressing fundamental questions in high energy, nuclear and astrophysics. The PI is actively involved in outreach activities designed to promote physics in Houston schools and she will give public lectures and seminars. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a microscopic understanding of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. The methodology employed here is to calculate relevant observables from first principles and map them to experimental measurements through phenomenological models. The specific objectives are as follows: determine the temperatures and densities at which hadrons are formed and relate them to the ones at which hadron yields are fixed by experiments; constrain the existence and position of the critical point at which the order of the phase transition changes; establish whether the interaction is strong enough to enable sequential, possibly flavor specific, hadron formation in the QGP. Besides having immediate applications to RHIC and LHC experiments, the project will also help us understand the nature of matter formation in the early Universe, which might clarify a variety of astrophysical phenomena pertaining to the interiors of stars and the matter distribution in the Universe."
0.2,"Gravitational physics is on the edge of a discovery that will shake its foundation: the direct detection of gravitational waves, tiny oscillations of the curvature of space-time that were predicted 100 years ago by Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Gravitational waves are produced by changes in the gravitational field of accelerating masses, and their detection will reveal information from the most cataclysmic and mysterious events in the Universe: the death of a star, the collision of black holes, and the Big Bang. This new era of gravitational physics is being ushered in by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and its sister project Virgo. This year marks the completion of hardware upgrades that form Advanced LIGO, a quantum-noise-limited laser interferometer which will probe about 1000 times more galaxies than initial LIGO. Source population studies suggest it will routinely detect gravitational waves from the collision of neutron stars and black holes. This award supports mission critical research for the detection of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO at the Georgia Institute of Technology, for the detection, characterization and astrophysical interpretation of gravitational wave transient signals in data from the first Advanced LIGO science runs.<br/><br/><br/>This project has three components: (1) participation in the LIGO-Virgo all-sky search for generic gravitational wave transients, sensitive to a wide range of compact object signatures, including core-collapse supernovae, coalescence of neutron star and/or black hole binary systems and neutron star oscillations, (2) development of innovative approaches to blending data analysis and numerical relativity, with contribution to targeted searches for binary black hole coalescences, and (3) characterization of Advanced LIGO data to enable scientific discovery, to deliver the data quality information necessary to clean the data sets and veto false positives, and to identify data quality issues early enough that they can be mitigated in the instruments, within the LIGO Detector Characterization team. The award will benefit from the long term collaboration of the PI and co-PI and a synergistic team at the GeorgiaTech Center for Relativistic Astrophysics, with experts in computational astrophysics, cosmology, particle astrophysics, astronomy, the college of computing and a strong outreach program in Atlanta, enhanced by the new ties to the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, and a firm commitment to diversity and the role of women in STEM."
0.68,"The study of the strong nuclear force under extremely high temperature and energy density is one of the key areas of investigation in nuclear physics. The theoretical framework of the strong force is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), whose fundamental particles are the quarks and gluons. These in turn build up protons and neutrons, which are understood to be the low-energy phase of quarks, bound by the strong nuclear force. At the very high temperatures reached in relativistic heavy ion collisions, the aim of this project to study how protons and neutrons melt into constituent quarks and gluons, which are no longer bound. This high-temperature phase of nuclear matter is called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Heavy-ion experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider have produced striking evidence for QGP formation. The field is moving towards a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic properties of the QGP.<br/><br/>Given this background, the project focuses on the experimental measurement of three distinct thermodynamic properties of this novel state of nuclear matter with the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The first property to be measured is the temperature produced in the hottest stages of the collision. This is done via the study of Upsilon mesons, a bound state of heavy ""bottom"" quarks. In the hot, early stage of the collision even heavy-quark bound states, like the Upsilon, are expected to melt in the collision. The group will study the melting pattern of Upsilons and their excited states with STAR and with CMS in proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions. This measurement will provide crucial information to test models of the deconfinement of quarks in the high-temperature QGP. The second goal is to study the thermodynamic phase structure of the strong force. In particular, testing the existence of a predicted QCD critical point is a key component of this goal. This study is done with STAR by varying the collision energy, and thereby exploring the transition between normal nuclear matter and QGP matter. The third goal is to study the density of the medium using events in which a neutral electroweak boson, the Z0, is produced in coincidence with a quark jet. The Z0 is unaffected by the QGP, providing a clean estimate of the transverse momentum of the quark jet. As the partner jet traverses the dense QGP medium and loses energy, these Z0 + quark jet events are one of the best ways to study the energy loss of quarks.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work are aimed at underrepresented minorities and women. The first is to communicate the excitement of high-energy nuclear physics to Latino students at the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), through mentoring activities at the conference and support of the UC Davis SACNAS chapter. The second component is promotion of science and physics to elementary and high-school students through visits to elementary schools with large Latino populations, and via participation in the Adopt-A-Physicist program for high schools. Finally, the PIs in the project will mentor undergraduates, including NSF REU students, every year. A key part of these goals is the mentoring of our own graduate students to become leaders in these activities, since many are women and underrepresented minorities, and are therefore excellent role models."
0.476263,"This award supports projects in the area of astrophysical interpretation of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binaries with two compact objects, black holes or neutron stars, through both GW data analysis, GW source modeling and interpretation. The proposed work focuses on developing a concrete framework for the processing of GW detections (or event rate upper limits) in order to extract the maximal available astrophysical information for binaries with compact objects with any mass and spin configuration. Specifically the following three main research projects are targeted: (i) parameter estimation for binaries with two compact objects using advanced applied mathematics methods, including the advancement of algorithms and computational tools, so that we can measure masses and spins of black holes and neutron stars and localize their GW emission on the sky so we can understand their physical origin; (ii) development of a quantitative framework for using GW event rates to derive constraints on astrophysical models of compact-object binary formation and evolution; and (iii) the astrophysical interpretation of multiple GW detections and associated mass and spin measurements, accounting quantitatively for GW observational biases and selection effects. Furthermore, the involvement in public outreach activities is intended to strengthen the connection between astronomy and GW physics, by focusing on projects that explain the formation of GW sources to the public.<br/><br/>This work is of interest to the broader community of compact-object astrophysics in a wide range of contexts: e.g., stellar and binary system evolution, neutron star and black hole formation, gamma-ray bursts, stellar dynamics of globular clusters and galactic centers, as in the coming years LIGO observations can provide uniquely reliable answers to some of the long-standing questions in astronomy and astrophysics. The computational tools to be developed will be made available within and outside the LSC, and hence can benefit other LSC projects and enhance the research infrastructure for parameter estimation in other scientific and engineering contexts. Outreach activities take advantage of the existing collaboration with the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum with hundreds of thousands of visitors per year; this connection ensures the broad dissemination of research understanding in the diverse, urban environment of the Chicago metropolitan area. Our group also has an active history and interest in involving undergraduate students in research projects and promotes a framework of peer learning in tutoring and mentoring."
0.17,"Understanding the origin of the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe is one of the primary goals of physics and cosmology. One potential explanation for the asymmetry requires the neutrino be its own antiparticle, meaning that the neutrino and antineutrino are the same particle. If the neutrino has this property it would show that the neutrino gets its mass in a fundamentally different way than all other particles, and help explain the absence of antimatter in the universe. Neutrinoless double beta decay is the only practical way to establish if the neutrino is its own antiparticle. This award will support the PI and his group in a search for neutrinoless double beta decay using the SNO+ detector in an operating mine in Sudbury Ontario. <br/><br/><br/>SNO+ is a multipurpose neutrino experiment whose primary goal is a search for neutrinoless double beta decay using tellurium (Te) dissolved in the liquid scintillator. SNO+ will also a have broad program of neutrino physics including measurements of solar neutrinos, nucleon decay, reactor neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, and detection of neutrinos from a supernova should one occur. The SNO+ benefits from a high mass of isotope and several other advantages. If the background levels are as anticipated, the SNO+ technique (i.e., using a large liquid scintillator detector) could provide an extremely cost-effective way to cover a wide range of effective Majorana masses."
0.414596,"By removing an electron from an atom or molecule, one creates a ""handle"" which allows one to grab it and hold onto it using electric and/or magnetic fields. The ability to trap and manipulate atoms and molecules in this way has long been recognized to hold great scientific and technological potential, with applications ranging from quantum-controlled chemistry to precision tests of the basic theories of physics which underlie virtually all of modern technology. Trapped atoms (and their ionized counterparts) have been studied by many groups, but it is more difficult (although potentially more rewarding) to trap and probe the relatively fragile molecules. The mostly untapped potential of molecules relates to their ability to rotate and vibrate, internal degrees of freedom which are absent in atoms. However, before the full potential of trapped molecules can be realized, techniques must be developed to determine their degree of rotation and vibration without destroying the molecules in the process. Here, the supported research group proposes capturing camera images of trapped molecules in such a way that they only appear in the picture if they have specific well-defined rotational and vibrational energies. These camera images will provide a means to non-destructively determine the rotation and vibration of trapped molecules, with detection resolution achievable down to the single-molecule level. It is anticipated that the development of these techniques will eventually find application in the chemical industry and in the realization of more advanced quantum computers.<br/><br/>With prior NSF support, the supported research group at Northwestern University demonstrated a technique to control the quantum rotational state of trapped molecules using a single femtosecond laser to simultaneously optically pump from all thermally populated excited levels. This technique works for molecular ions with a special internal structure, those possessing a so-called diagonal electronic transition, allowing many photons to be scattered before vibrations are excited. These molecules can be roughly thought of as the alkali atoms of the molecule world. In the present work, fluorescence of trapped molecular ions will be imaged directly on a CCD camera, lighting up certain locations in a one-dimensional Coulomb crystal where the single molecular ion at that site is in the probed quantum state. These CCD images will thus provide molecular state readout with single-molecule resolution. The group will then use fluorescence state readout in order to observe electric-dipole mediated rotational entanglement between co-trapped polar molecular ions. Future extensions of the work proposed here could include scattering-free detection of single molecules using optical phase shifts, directly using heavy molecular ion fluorescence readout for parity-violation and time-reversal symmetry violation searches, implementations of conditional quantum gates, entangling molecular ions with external circuits, and studies of decoherence dynamics in ion traps."
0.193516,"Gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of space-time created by moving masses, which travel through the universe at the speed of light. Predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (GR) - the most commonly accepted model of gravity - gravitational waves have not been detected yet. The direct observations of gravitational waves would be one of the most fundamental results in the modern science and the ultimate test of GR. Also gravitational waves will be a radically new tool for exploring fundamental physics and astronomy. They will probe the physics driving the most violent astrophysical events in the universe in ways inaccessible to electromagnetic astronomy. The construction of the U.S. Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO) is almost complete. The aLIGO detectors will conduct the first observations in the fall 2015. Within the next few years, aLIGO and its international partner detectors Virgo and Kagra expect to make the first detections of gravitational waves from merging compact binary objects, such as neutron stars and black holes. Gravitational waves produced by the collision of black holes, asymmetric core collapse supernovae, rapidly spinning neutron stars, and even by the Big Bang itself are targets for detection in the years to come. <br/><br/>This award supports high priority searches for gravitational-wave transients from a broad class of astrophysical sources. These searches are capable of detecting gravitational transients in a wide range of source parameters, including yet unknown sources. They target the most extreme astrophysical events, such as supernovae, gamma-ray-bursts, mergers of neutron stars and black holes, and hold a promise for discoveries of entirely new astrophysical phenomena. Also, they will extend the most promising advanced LIGO searches for compact binary sources into the binary parameter space not covered by the existing template algorithms. These searches have a potential to establish the existence of intermediate mass binary black holes, look inside the galactic nuclei by detecting binaries with the eccentric orbits, and test the theory of general relativity at high field regime with the intermediate mass ratio binary sources. Rapid source reconstruction and sky localization will enable joint observations, with the electromagnetic telescopes advancing the field of the multi-messenger astronomy. Sophisticated signal processing algorithms and source reconstruction methods will be implemented and applied to find the source polarization and waveforms. A novel wavelet regression method will be used for the analysis and characterization of aLIGO data, targeting identification, monitoring and cancellation of environmental noise coupled into the detector output. Studies of noise sources will be performed and novel noise cancellation techniques will be tested to enable the first confident detection of gravitational-wave transients."
0.21,"The research project is a computational oriented theoretical effort that aims at understanding the physical origin of thermal noise in optical coating materials at the atomic level and providing guidance for the optimal ratio of metallic elements in composite amorphous oxides (silica, titania, tantala, hafnia etc). Thermal noise that is caused by atomic movement at finite temperature affects the performance of ultra high-resolution interferometers such as the laser interferometer employed in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and is of special interest to the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC). The project will provide rigorous training for graduate students in computational physics. The PI has collaborations with a number of international experimental and computational materials physics groups including a group at Glasgow UK, ETH Zurich, and a group at Fudan University Shanghai. She also visits Colombi at the Institute of Astrophysics Paris to discuss issues regarding large-structure simulations. The LSC is an international organization. It also has a tight relation with other organizations that focus on gravitational wave observations. The optical group organizes focus sessions at LIGO meetings jointly with other gravitational organizations (VIRGO, AGO etc.) and in independent workshops.<br/><br/>Advanced LIGO, the major upgrade of LIGO, is expected to be limited by thermal noise in the most critical ~50-150 Hz frequency band while the performance of several state-of-the art frequency stabilization systems is limited by thermal noise at frequencies as low as a few Hz. This project also studies mechanical properties of crystalline materials (GaAs/AlGaAs, and GaP/AlGaP), a new paradigm for optical coating that has been demonstrated experimentally. Improving dielectric coatings and reducing thermal noise have applications in many high precision optical measurements far beyond LIGO, such as time and frequency measurements, measurements of the equivalence principle, and many others. The computational approach of characterizing amorphous materials will also be useful to many other areas such as nano-scale science, materials science, and bio-science."
0.5,"The LIGO observatories were built to detect gravitational waves from many different astrophysical sources such as neutron star and black hole binary systems or supernova explosions. In the wake of the currently ongoing upgrade, the detectors will be limited by coating thermal noise and, at higher frequencies, by shot noise, the statistical properties of classical fields. Coating thermal noise is caused by the Brownian motion of the atoms which comprise the dielectric coatings on the surfaces of the mirrors. We will measure coating thermal noise of the Advanced LIGO coatings, other dielectric coatings, and of newly developed crystalline coatings as a function of beam size and temperature over the entire Advanced LIGO frequency band in a fast turn-around testbed to characterize these coating and verify the theoretical models used to describe them. It is known for almost 30 years that non-classical light fields, squeezed light, can in principle be used to reduce shot noise. The improvements are limited by optical losses between the source of the non-classical field, the squeezer, and the main interferometer. One of the dominating loss mechanisms are optical losses in the Faraday isolator; an optical directional coupler for the injected laser light. We will develop low loss Faraday isolators to reduce the losses and improve the range of Advanced LIGO and other interferometric gravitational wave detectors. These improvements, together with improvements made by others in the LIGO Science Collaboration, will help to increase the detection rate and fidelity of the Advanced LIGO signals to further improve the understanding of these astrophysics signals.<br/><br/>Advanced LIGO is one of the most complex experiments ever built. It continues to push many technologies to its fundamental limits and meeting these limits gives US companies the needed edge to maintain their lead and compete in the world markets. The optical industry in the US was pushed by LIGO to continuously improve their coatings and the leading commercial coating companies are all in the US. In addition, the development of high quality optical coatings with very low thermal coating noise has spin-offs in other areas like time and frequency standards which enable potential improvements in GPS and in precision metrology. Precision metrology leads to improvements in precision manufacturing and increased shares of world markets. Low loss optical components such as the low loss Faraday isolator we will develop have commercial potential and are required in many future scientific experiments in optical information technology, quantum computing, laser physics, and other areas. The potential improvements in the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO will increase the number of detectable gravitational wave sources by at least an order of magnitude, making visible the most energetic events in the Universe and attracting new minds to astronomy and astrophysics and to science in general."
0.403681,"Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. This award supports scientists at the University of Utah to carry out gamma-ray astrophysics research using two complementary ground-based observatories. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to study high energy gamma-rays with very sensitive pointed observations. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a continuously-operating array with a wide field of view that can observe two-thirds of the high energy gamma-ray sky every day. The University of Utah group will contribute to the operation and maintenance of VERITAS and HAWC and work on analysis and interpretation of the scientific data. The group will continue and expand their existing education and outreach activities using the on-campus South Physics Observatory, the high altitude Willard L. Eccles Observatory, and the Star Base Utah Observatory for both public education and student projects. They will build new connections to Utah senior citizens through courses developed for the University's Osher Institute. <br/><br/>The University of Utah group will use VERITAS to extend detections of flaring active galactic nuclei to higher redshifts, setting more stringent limits on the flux of extragalactic background light. Long-term VERITAS observations of high mass x-ray binaries as well as other galactic binaries and microquasars will be used to explore similarities in their time-dependent gamma-ray emission, while observations of Galactic supernova remnants will be used to explore the origin of galactic cosmic rays. Using both VERITAS and HAWC synergistically, the group will explore the origin of cosmic rays in diffuse supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae, and enhance the search for neutralino Dark Matter emission from unidentified high galactic latitude VHE gamma-ray sources."

If WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-based detectors.<br/><br/>This award will provide funding for this Syracuse group to collaborate on the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (now SuperCDMS) that has a track record as one of the world's most sensitive. The PI will lead his group to achieve better rejection of surface interactions and identify neutrons that multiply scatter within a detector, aided by detailed simulations of the detector response. The group will help develop and construct a detector to veto events caused by neutrons and measure the expected neutron background in SuperCDMS. The group will take part in SuperCDMS detector testing, including making key contributions to a unique deep facility, demonstrating the rejection capabilities of new detectors and providing critical feedback for detector fabrication and development. The long-term activities include additional cryogenic detector research, focusing on technologies that allow easier manufacturing and the possibility of a single cost-effective experiment to detect both dark matter and neutrinoless double-beta decay.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Technological development of phonon-mediated detectors has widespread applications in astronomy and physics.

0.495,"Nuclear astrophysics is the application of nuclear physics knowledge obtained from laboratory studies to the universe and its contents. This is essential for understanding how the chemical elements are produced, the ways stars are powered, what causes exploding stars called supernovae, the origin of cosmic rays, and more. A key research frontier is based on using neutrinos, subatomic particles that have no electric charge and very little mass, and which barely interact with matter. This makes neutrinos hard to detect, but allows them to escape from and thus reveal physical conditions in the deep interiors of astrophysical objects. The unique information they carry will help resolve longstanding questions in nuclear astrophysics. Research is needed to further develop detection techniques and to draw conclusions from the data. There is high demand for students and postdocs trained in this research area. The topics covered, which also include black holes, dark matter, and the universe itself, capture the imagination of the public and attract young people to explore careers in science. <br/><br/>This project is intended to lead to significant gains in our understanding of astrophysical objects and neutrinos themselves. The knowledge of theoretical physics and astrophysics will be applied to help lead to new detections of astrophysical neutrinos and to develop new understandings from that data. A central focus of this project is on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background, the cosmic flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by the explosions of massive stars over the past several billion years. This flux has not been detected yet, but it is within reach, and careful work is needed to help isolate this faint signal. Related topics include detecting other astrophysical neutrino sources, the nature of supernovae, and the properties of neutrinos. Junior scientists supported by the grant will be mentored in the full range of skills needed to be successful in their future careers. To maximize broader impacts, the work integrates efforts in research, mentoring, teaching, and outreach, with a focus on underrepresented populations, including the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.<br/><br/>This award is supported jointly by the Theoretical Nuclear Physics Program in the Division of Physics, the Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program in the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities."
0.3,"This research program will use ultracold atoms to emulate, with precise experimental control, the behavior of electrons in graphene, a technologically interesting allotrope of carbon, and that of fundamental particles (e.g. quarks or leptons) governed by the laws of special relativity and quantum mechanics. In doing so, this program can elucidate open questions regarding the equilibrium and dynamical behaviors of such systems when comprised of many particles that strongly interact. To achieve this, ultracold lithium-6 atoms will be confined in an optical lattice potential formed from interfering laser fields which produce a honeycomb intensity pattern through which the atoms move. This lattice potential mimics that experienced by electrons in graphene which move through a honeycomb lattice of carbon ions. At a particular filling fraction of the lattice sites, the low-energy excitations of the system are governed by the laws of relativistic quantum mechanics but with an effective speed of light that is orders of magnitude smaller, making the direct observation of relativistic quantum dynamics experimentally feasible. Phenomena to be studied include Klein tunneling, Veselago lensing, chiral symmetry breaking, and the effect of interactions and disorder on particle mobility. These phenomena are relevant both for understanding electron transport in graphene and elucidating fundamental predictions of relativistic quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>The investigations of transport (including the role that interactions and disorder play) and mechanisms for opening a bandgap in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice can potentially aid the development of nanoelectronic devices based on graphene such as ultra-high speed transistors and novel electron optics devices. The opening of a bandgap due to interactions will also provide insight into chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation in quantum chromo-dynamics. In carrying out this research, undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researcher associates will be trained in the use of modern technology, analytical thinking, scientific writing and giving clear oral presentations.

This project will investigate new algorithms and techniques for data analysis using emerging computing processor architectures. These activities will enable the LHC experiments to take data more efficiently and improve the quality of the data that is recorded in order to extend the reach of the next generation of discoveries from planned hardware upgrades at the LHC over the next decade. The results of this research will significantly reduce the cost of computing for all LHC experiments. Software source code tools will be made available to the particle physics community.

0.185,"Precise experimental tests of fundamental particle properties are now a well-established way to search for new laws of nature beyond our current physical knowledge. The proposed research is for two experiments to make precise measurements of an elementary particle called the muon, which is similar to the electron but with larger mass. One experiment at tha Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, called g-2, will measure the magnetic moment of the muon to an accuracy of better than a part-per-million, which will provide a test of the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that explains the properties of the elementary particles making up most of the visible matter in the Universe. The other experiment, called MuSun, at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland will measure the lifetime of an atom comprised of a muon and a deuteron (a nucleus made from one proton and one neutron). This experiment will further the knowledge of the reaction of thermonuclear hydrogen burning which powers the sun, as well as helping to understand neutrino interactions with matter.<br/><br/>The muon g-2 experiment will measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment to 140 parts-per-billion, a four-fold improvement over the previous experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), known as E821. The measurement will address the longstanding 3 standard deviation discrepancy between the same measurement from E821 and the Standard Model prediction. It represents a key test of the Standard Model and has broad sensitivity to new particles and interactions beyond the Standard Model. The muon g-2 project has involved the relocation of the muon storage ring from Brookhaven National Laboratory to Fermilab as well as new detector, electronics and acquisition systems. The PI and his group are responsible for the 8 GByte/sec calorimeter readout, using multi-teraflop GPU-based data processing, and distributed event building for the data acquisition system. The MuSun experiment will measure the mu- d to n n neutrino doublet capture rate to an accuracy of 1.5%. The measurement addresses a longstanding discrepancy among earlier measurements of mu d capture. It will provide a five-fold improvement in our knowledge of the two-body weak axial currents that plays a role in pp thermonuclear fusion, cross sections for neutrino experiments, and ordinary and double beta-decay."
0.48,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. A primary area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), and are the subject of this investigation. This research will involve the work of two post-doctoral researchers as well as graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award supports work, using the neutrino beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), on three related neutrino experiments: MINERvA, Nova and MINOS+ all measuring neutrino oscillations: muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions. To correctly measure these transitions, precise knowledge of neutrino interactions is required. This award will be used to measure (using the MINERvA detector) these interactions across a wide energy range available at FNAL. This will improve our knowledge of the neutrino flux, useful for future Short Baseline (detector near the source at FNAL) and Long Baseline (detector hundreds of kilometers away) experiments as well as the current Nova experiment. The work on the MINOS+ experiment will help map out the shape of the energy dependence of the neutrino oscillation probability, which could reveal new anomalies in the neutrino sector. A number of BSM proposed phenomena, from sterile neutrinos to extra dimensions, can cause measurable deviations in the neutrino oscillation probability in the 4-10GeV range."

Other experiments focus on the evolution of nuclear shell structure with increasing neutron number, especially near the magic numbers of 20 and 28. The behavior of nuclei at ultra-high spin will be explored through discrete gamma spectroscopy using arrays of gamma detectors at FSU and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The group will also exploit heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to investigate the characteristics of the quark-gluon plasma. The broader societal impacts of this project lie in the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in a hands-on environment. Florida State University has served as one of the leading educators in the field of nuclear physics (4th highest Ph.D. production in the U.S.) and this grant will enable the group to continue to attract and train the best and brightest graduate students in experimental nuclear physics. Because of the students' training and hands-on work with high tech equipment in a forefront nuclear physics laboratory, FSU graduates are in high demand and now serve in key roles in homeland security, national defense, high-tech industry, leading edge research, and STEM education. Finally, these measurements will be important for understanding stellar processes and the abundance of elements in our universe. <br/><br/>A significant part of the proposed research uses short-lived rare nuclear isotopes from the FSU Fox Laboratory to study nuclear reactions and structure in unstable nuclei. This is very important for reactions of astrophysical importance, many of which proceed through unstable nuclei. These beams have low intensity and so will benefit from the ANASEN active target and detector array recently developed by FSU in collaboration with Louisiana State University. A newly developed neutron detector array (RESONEUT) will be used to study (d,n) reactions in inverse kinematics with radioactive beams. A series of experiments is planned to measure the critical parameter of lifetime following beta decay of heavy, neutron-rich nuclei on and close to the expected r-process path at TRIUMF. The confrontation of state-of-the-art shell model calculations for multiple cross-shell excitations with proposed nuclear structure measurements will strengthen their reliability for extrapolation to the astrophysically important region. The FSU 14C beam will be used to explore nuclear structure in more neutron-rich nuclei with a recently digitized Germanium detector array. Measurements using gamma detector arrays (GRETINA and GAMMASPHERE) will explore newly proposed exotic shapes and ultra-high-spin structures in the atomic mass ~ 150 region. Other work involves studying the quark-gluon plasma with heavy flavor probes using the PHENIX detector system, parts of which were constructed at FSU. In this instance the FSU focus is on the effects of cold nuclear matter on heavy quarkonia production."
0.134,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Pearl Sandick at the University of Utah.<br/><br/>There are several compelling reasons to expect that our current Standard Model of particle physics is incomplete, not least of which is the puzzle of the nature of the dark matter in the Universe. Professor Sandick's research involves theoretical investigations of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, in which each Standard Model particle has an as-yet unobserved ""superpartner"" particle. Even in the most minimal supersymmetric models, the lightest of these superpartners provides a natural explanation for the dark matter. Currently, experiments are becoming sensitive to interesting observable phenomena predicted in many supersymmetric models. Taken together, experimental results from dark matter searches and particle colliders provide insight about the fundamental theory of particle physics that describes the world in which we live, but conclusions about whether a particular theory is excluded or supported by data rely on a robust understanding of its observable signatures.<br/><br/>Professor Sandick aims to improve our understanding of minimal supersymmetric parameter spaces by making explicit connections between experimental signatures and the aspects of particle physics models necessary to generate them. As part of this project, extensive studies of the consequences of different types of model complexity will be performed, highlighting the lessons we can learn about the characteristics of new models of particle physics from dark matter experiments and particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The main focus is on connecting collider signatures to the signatures in dark matter detection as well as astrophysical signatures from dark matter annihilation and/or decay. This work will advance the knowledge of specialists, and also represents an opportunity to harness the broad public enthusiasm for dark matter and particle physics to educate the public about exciting advances and the future of the field and to recruit talented women and minorities to the physical sciences. These broader impacts will be accomplished through a suite of outreach and professional development programs in which the PI is involved."
0.470602,"The interactions of the fundamental particles inside atoms underpins atomic physics, chemistry, and the structure of all matter. The understanding of these interactions is based on precise measurements of the light that is emitted and absorbed by various atoms and molecules. The precise set of colors (or ""resonant frequencies"") of this light is a unique fingerprint that is used for chemical identification in a broad range of applications from medicine to defense and quality control in manufacturing. The precise measurement of the fingerprint can also tell us details about the fundamental particles that make up atoms. Recently, a measurement of a particular resonant frequency in hydrogen (an electron bound to a proton) and muonic hydrogen (a heavy version of the electron, the muon, bound to a proton) has revealed a mystery: the diameter of the proton appears to be different depending on which atom it is in. This mystery arises if one assumes that the electron and muon interact with the proton by the well-accepted theory called bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED) and that any differences must be attributed to the nuclear structure. Assuming that there have been no mistakes, there are 3 possibilities: QED is incorrect, the nuclear structure is incorrect, or there is some new kind of interaction which has not been taken to account. To decide whether the mystery is due to a problem with QED or not, two scientists from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) propose to measure the resonant frequencies of positronium, the simplest atom (consisting of an electron bound to an anti-electron) that should be described perfectly by bound-state QED theory. The new techniques developed for these measurements will lead to an improvement in the spectroscopy of unstable atoms which are at the frontier of the field of precision spectroscopy. The scientists involved with the project have a strong record in increasing diversity in physics. The PI plays a special role in the local community K-12 system, advising on increasing the number of students taking high school physics and increasing the pool of physical science/engineering majors in higher education and in teacher training. The co-PI has established a pipeline for recruiting local area junior college transfers to UCR, engaging them in research, and mentoring their eventual applications to graduate schools.<br/><br/>The purely leptonic atom positronium is uniquely well-suited for testing bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED) and provides the understanding and background by which one may extract non-QED physics out of precision atomic measurements on heavier leptons and hadrons. Few have dared to try measurements on positronium at the few parts in 10^12 level that would allow insight into physics such as the proton charge radius and higher level recoil effect corrections in muonium, and that might show differences between light and heavy leptons. The ideal level spacing for a precision measurement on positronium is the 1S-2S interval at approximately 1.234 PHz. Last measured in collaboration with S. Chu, knowledge of the first 10 digits of this interval has stood for 20 years with an uncertainty of ±3.2 MHz. The proposed experiment implements a new technique that would dramatically improve the accuracy of Ps atom spectroscopy and potentially other high resolution spectroscopy experiments, for example in muonium, by individual atom trajectory analysis. A position sensitive time-of-flight detector will record the trajectory and speed of every detected atom and thereby remove second-order Doppler shifts, AC Stark Shifts, and better account for transit-time broadening. The new detection method will allow for reducing the laser intensity and the speed of the detected atoms that heretofore have limited the measurement precision. The basic features of the analysis and development of the methods to analyze and reduce uncertainties will be accomplished using a wavemeter with ±2 MHz metrology relative to an ultrastable reference cavity. This method will be sufficient to produce narrow line widths (~1 MHz) and a vastly improved signal-to-noise ratio in the 3 year period of the proposal. A 100 fold better measurement and exploration of the systematic effects at 1000 fold better accuracy will be achieved with the acquisition of a laser frequency comb reference."
0.263725,"This project explores the use of real-time optical techniques and computational analyses to measure the behavior of microscopic nematodes in three dimensions. Most studies of Caenorhabditis elegans behavior are limited to two dimensions because of the requirement for microscopy in imaging analyses, yet nematodes in their natural soil habitat move and behave in a three-dimensional environment, influenced by stimuli in all three dimensions. This project aims to develop a method to analyze thrashing frequencies and other behaviors in nematodes in real time by tracking the temporal periodicity of diffraction patterns as well as applying laser shadowing and modeling of diffraction patterns using computational methods. C. elegans is a powerful model organism for elucidating cellular and genetic mechanisms underlying development, neural circuitry and cell signaling. However, despite a wealth of information about gene-level mechanisms, very little is known about how sensory information provided by mechanosensory, chemosensory and thermosensory cells is integrated in a dynamic way to govern shifts in behavioral patterns. <br/><br/>The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Study locomotory behavior in three dimensions using laser shadowing and modeling of diffraction, 2) Develop experimental, computational and modeling approaches to analyze optical patterns that correspond to behavioral, physiological and morphological characteristics of nematodes in isolation and in contact with conspecifics and 3) Use the approaches developed in aims 1 and 2 to examine how nematodes alter their behavior when exposed to different environmental conditions they likely encounter in their natural habitat, including crowding, responses to gravity, changes in the wavelength of light, among others. The results from this project will provide new insights into free-swimming nematode behavior in three dimensions. <br/><br/>This project also involves collaboration among faculty and students both at Vassar and at Delaware State University, an institution of predominantly underrepresented students. The PI will develop a summer undergraduate exchange program to enable the students to experience the different educational environments. Further, this project lies at the intersections of physics and biology and, as such, will expose the students to novel integrative and multidisciplinary approaches to important scientific questions that require knowledge and skills in both optics and in biology."
0.025,"Quantitative approaches such as mathematical modeling, high-throughput phenotyping combined with technology development may yet yield a united theory of biology and life. The ""modern synthesis"" of the early twentieth century predated the molecular biology revolution and the genomics era. Although many of the assumptions and predictions of traditional population genetics have proven correct, others have to be modified due to new discoveries such as non-genetic, protein and RNA-based inheritance and stress-inducible mutations. Likewise, researchers in the fields of molecular biology, genomics, and medicine are often unacquainted with population genetics theory. This meeting is aimed at the growing numbers of investigators attempting to unite these formerly disparate fields and to learn from physicists how to arrive at universal principles. This meeting aims to provide a home and community for researchers involved in this ongoing, cross-disciplinary endeavor. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) program includes invited and contributed oral and poster presentations by both younger and more established researchers, focusing on the best emerging science in the field.<br/><br/>The second meeting of the new Gordon Research Conference Molecular Mechanisms in Evolution, June 28th-July 3rd, 2015 at Stonehill College, Easton, MA breaks new ground by focusing on the mechanistic understanding of how genetic and epigenetic variation arises, especially in response to environmental stress, and to which extent this variation generates phenotypic diversity, shapes evolution, and contributes to disease. The meeting sessions address a wide range of topics, including discussions of the constraints that cell biology and stochasticity pose for non-traditional mechanisms of inheritance, insights garnered from experiments in the laboratory, mechanisms of coding and regulation highlighting the unexpected plasticity of genomes. The meeting will discuss how mechanistic knowledge could be used to predict and arrest inheritance processes in infectious diseases and cancer. The GRC will promote international and national collaboration between physicists and biologists of diverse disciplines to promote systematic and quantitative analyses of biological processes, intensified theory building and deeper understanding of basic biology. This meeting will provide networking opportunities, inspiration and connections for young scientists, mentoring, and perspectives on cutting-edge new research for young participants at a critical stage in their careers. The requested funds will be used to defray the costs of a diverse group of graduate students, postdocs, new investigators, women, and minority participants.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.353,"Nuclear Science is tasked with answering questions such as: (i) How did matter come into being and how does it evolve? (ii) How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge? (iii) How can the knowledge and technology progress provided by nuclear physics best be used to benefit society? Providing answers to these questions depends on a detailed theoretical understanding of nuclear reactions, a field in which current approaches are either outdated or limited to a small number of applications. In this larger context, this project will focus on the theoretical study of deuteron-induced reactions. Due to the short lifetimes involving exotic nuclei, direct neutron capture measurements of relevance to the origin of the heavy elements are often not possible. Indirect techniques like deuteron induced reactions are a common tool to extract the relevant astrophysical rates. These reactions are part of ongoing experimental programs at radioactive beam facilities, as well as programs at future facilities such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). As such, this project will provide theoretical support to challenging experimental programs and will provide a unique training opportunity for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.<br/><br/>A reliable reaction theory is critical for the understanding the data produced at experimental programs using (d,p) reactions. From a theoretical perspective, (d,p) reactions are attractive because the scattering can be reduced to an effective three-body problem. One of the most challenging aspects of solving the three-body problems for nuclear reactions is posed by the repulsive Coulomb interaction. While for light nuclei the momentum-space Faddeev equations can be treated by screening the Coulomb force, a similar approach is difficult to implement for heavy systems. Indeed, for most of the new exotic nuclei to be produced at FRIB, currently available computational methods are not adequate. This project will address this critical need and provide an implementation of an exact Faddeev method for the three-body nuclear reaction problem, in which the Coulomb force will be treated without screening."
0.794533,"In this project the PI will quantify and understand the non-equilibrium behavior of biological membranes and membrane coupled processes in the context of dynamical systems. The objective will be met by employing physically reconstituted systems that are driven out of equilibrium in a controlled manner. This approach will allow the systematic and quantitative study of the bidirectional interrelations between dynamic membrane organization and the function of membrane associated proteins that arise in non-equilibrium situations. The following aims will be undertaken: Aim 1: The driving mechanisms based on simulated ion flux will be characterized and the concentration profile of multivalent ions at charged membranes will be studied. Aim 2 will focus on the aggregation dynamics of multivalent lipid species under ionic forcing. Aim 3: Study the modulation of protein action on multiply charged lipids in spatially heterogeneous membranes and the resulting structural response of membranes. Aim 4: Will address the question how combined systems of membranes and proteins organize in time and space under simultaneous forcing. In addition the following outreach activities will be undertaken: (1) Initiation of a pre-college level outreach program that will use biophysics based tools to improve physical science education in local schools and connect students to people and academic research on campus. It includes class demonstrations and lecture units led by graduate students, development of experiment based class modules involving high school teachers and a lab- internship program for high school students. (2) Development of biophysics and soft condensed matter based laboratory modules for physics classes for non-majors. In addition, the PI will develop a biophysics course for upper-division physics majors and entry levels graduate students. The course will provide a basic foundation for students and enable them to understand physics in its relationship to other scientific fields. It will also equip the students for active interdisciplinary research at the intersection of the physical and life sciences. (3) By engaging in the research aims of this program, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in biophysical methods and techniques and they will advance their knowledge and communication skills beyond the traditional boundaries of scientific disciplines.

0.392342,"Gravity is the least understood fundamental force of nature: there is a 16 order of magnitude disparity between the energy scale of quantum gravity and that of the electromagnetic and nuclear forces. The mystery can be cast in another way: why is gravity so much weaker? As a number of recent theories have suggested, important clues related to this ""hierarchy problem"" can be obtained by measuring how gravity behaves at sub-millimeter distances. Such measurements could lead to exciting new discoveries of physics beyond our current knowledge. However, the gravitational force between massive objects becomes weak very rapidly as their size and separation distance changes, thus making ultra-sensitive measurements a necessity at sub-millimeter length scales. This group is developing an experiment based on new technology which could advance our understanding of gravity by several orders of magnitude at the micrometer length scale. In this approach, a test mass is suspended in a ""container"" made of light, leading to greatly reduced friction and enhanced sensitivity. This research program is at the forefront of current knowledge and will enhance the scientific competency of the state of Nevada, which is currently under-represented in terms of scientific endeavor. The collaboration with researchers at Stanford and the NSF-sponsored Stanford Nanofabrication facility will improve the research infrastructure for the state, opening new pathways for future collaborations involving nanotechnology. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be broadly trained in experimental physics and nanofabrication and will be well positioned for entry into the scientific workforce. The fundamental nature of this project appeals to our sense of wonder about the natural world. The nation will benefit from an improved understanding of high-energy physics related to gravitational physics at the micron-length scale, at a fraction of the cost of particle-collider experiments.<br/><br/>This award supports work on an experiment with the goal of using laser-cooled trapped microspheres to test for Yukawa-type deviations from Newtonian gravity at the micron length scale. By optically levitating the force sensor, an exquisite decoupling from the environment is possible, potentially yielding sub-attonewton force sensitivity. This new technique could ultimately advance our understanding of gravity at the micron length scale by a factor of 100,000 or more, probing deep into the parameter space for theoretically predicted deviations from Newtonian gravity. In addition to studies of short-range gravitational forces, the experimental technique we propose could also enable novel investigations of Casimir forces in unexplored regimes. The project is conceptually divided into three tasks: (1) calibration and optimization of the force sensitivity of the trapped cooled microspheres, (2) final assembly of the source mass and its driving mechanism, (3) investigation of systematic errors in preliminary gravity measurements. We will also investigate novel methods for cooling the levitated nanospheres, involving sympathetic cooling with cold atoms.

4.1325,"This award will provide continued funding for the scientific analysis of data taken with the IceCube neutrino detector. Extensive efforts by the University of Wisconsin - Madison group towards improving the calibrations and the analysis software for the final detector configuration, including implementing significant refinements of the understanding of the optical properties of the ice, have resulted in an improved instrument. IceCube has detected more than 300,000 atmospheric neutrinos during construction, some with energies that exceed by more than three orders of magnitude the energies of those produced with accelerator beams. The construction of DeepCore, an infill of the IceCube array over a significant instrumented volume of very clear ice in the bottom half of the detector, has lowered the threshold to 10 Gigaelectronvolts (GeV). This immediately resulted in the observation of atmospheric neutrino oscillations at energies previously inaccessible with statistical significance greater than five standard deviations. On the other end of the energy spectrum, with IceCube's improved effective area, measurements have reached sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos produced in the interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays with cosmic microwave photons, thus creating a new opportunity to reveal their sources. IceCube's sensitivity has reached a level where, from general arguments, they must observe supernova remnants and gamma-ray bursts if these are indeed the sources of the galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays, respectively.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: IceCube results will enhance scientific and technological understanding on many levels through broad dissemination of the results and experiences. IceCube is in a unique class of projects that inspire the innovative capacity of a new generation of American scientists and engineers.

0.67,"Quantum Post Selected Optomechanics<br/><br/>This research deals with a recently proposed scheme for producing and detecting quantum states of an opto-mechanical system. The scheme is based on nested-interferometers and quantum post-selection techniques. Consider a photon entering a Mach-Zender interferometer. The photon encounters an optomechanical system in one arm of the Mach-Zender interferometer. If the photon does not succeed in changing the phonon excitation of the optomechanical system the photon will leave the interferometer in one specific output of the interferometer. However in the rare event of a phonon excitation the photon can leave the interferometer at the second output of the interferometer. Photon detection in this second output will post-select for a strong optomechanical interaction. Combining this with a second interferometry method for the same photon, based on optical delay lines, can yield information on the decoherence of the optomechanical system. This method relieves several of the challenges associated with previous optical schemes for measuring macroscopic superpositions, and only requires the devices to be in the weak coupling regime. With the implementation of this new scheme combined with advances in the design and fabrication of optomechanical systems (based on the use of Graphene, Silicon Nitride films, Boron Nitride and Carbon nanotube technology) it is expected that significant progress towards testing quantum mechanics at the macroscopic scale can be made.<br/><br/><br/>Photons take a quantum Mulligan<br/><br/>Imagine a game of golf in which you are allowed millions of do-overs, so-called ""Mulligans,"" until finally hitting that hole-in-one. This research on ""Quantum Post Selected Optomechanics"" aims precisely at doing this. Since the famous Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment, physicists have tried to observe quantum effects in larger and larger systems, in order to better understand the transition from quantum to classical behavior. In particular, interest has focused on optomechanical systems, tiny mechanical devices that can be pushed by light. However, it has proven extremely difficult to design a so-called ""strongly coupled"" device, one that is flimsy enough to be pushed significantly by a single photon. This research deals with a way to send many individual photons and then, after the fact, pick only those hole-in-one events where, thanks to a quantum fluctuation, the push was significant. After the interaction with the mechanical device, the photon interferes with itself, and usually travels one way. It only travels the other way if it has actually given a quantum of motion to the device (a hole-in-one). This method of post-selection should enable the study of quantum dynamics of mechanical systems."

While the theory known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has become accepted as describing the strong interaction, which binds the constituent quarks and gluons in the nucleon, numerous questions still remain about the quark spatial and momentum distributions. The principle investigator and students will take a leading role in the first experiment to take place at Jefferson Lab after the recent upgrade, with the goal of measuring the quark spatial and momentum distributions in the nucleon, called the F_2 structure function. These distributions will be compared with predictions from models of the nucleon inspired by QCD theory.

0.018267,"When a massive star reaches the end of its life, the core of the star collapses, producing a supernova. While visually spectacular, less than 1% of the energy in the supernova is released as visible light or as kinetic energy in the surrounding environment. Most of the energy from the supernova is released in neutrinos, which are small particles that only interact weakly with matter. The neutrino emission from a supernova precedes the emission of visible light by a few minutes up to many hours. Detecting the first neutrinos from a supernova therefore provides an early alert to trigger further observations. The SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) is a network of neutrino detectors around the world designed to provide automated early alerts for supernovae in our galaxy. While rare, a galactic supernova would provide a unique opportunity to study the physics of core-collapse supernova, as well as the properties of neutrinos. The early alerts from SNEWS will enable observations of the earliest phases of the supernova for physicists and astronomers around the world. The SNEWS project works to engage amateur astronomers, who may play an important role in optical observations of supernova, and to involve them in the science of supernova. <br/><br/>SNEWS involves neutrino detectors around the world: Super-K, Large Volume Detector, IceCube, Borexino, KAMLand, and Daya Bay. If any of the participating experiments finds a burst of events, it sends a datagram to the central SNEWS computer located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, with a backup located in Bologna. If a coincidence is found within 10 seconds, a supernova alert will be sent out. SNEWS has been operational since 1998, and has been running in a fully-automated mode since 2005 with near-100% up-time. This award will provide funds to maintain the SNEWS system, support undergraduate researchers participating in the project, and expand connections to the astronomical community."
0.035,"Despite its numerous successes the Standard Model of Particle Physics is known to be incomplete, implying that there exists important physics beyond. As an example, there is strong evidence from astronomical observations for the existence of so-called dark matter. The known particles of the Standard Model make up only a small fraction of the total matter in the Universe. Very little is known about the nature of dark matter. A number of experiments are underway or in the planning stage to look for dark matter manifesting itself in a new type of particle. A technically demanding experiment at Jefferson Lab, called DarkLight, has been proposed to specifically search for the production of a so-called dark photon in the scattering of electrons from protons. If such a particle were to exist, it would lead to new physics beyond the Standard Model, and hence would be transformative in our understanding of the matter distribution of the Universe.<br/><br/>This grant is for work on the DarkLight phase I lepton tracker, to be built as a set of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors, a relatively new technology for which the group has developed expertise in recent years with the involvement in the OLYMPUS and MUSE projects. The NSF funded the DarkLight phase-I apparatus through a Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant, and the experiment is expected to take place at Jefferson Lab in 2016-2017. This award provides support for one graduate student to pursue a PhD on this project. One part of the PhD thesis will have a hardware focus with the construction and implementation of the lepton tracker into the DarkLight phase I apparatus. The second focus of the thesis will be the running, simulation and analysis of DarkLight phase I data, with three distinctive scientific goals: 1) studies with the Energy Recovery Linac at Jefferson Lab, 2) measurement of Standard Model processes in DarkLight, and 3) search for a new particle called the A'."
0.11,"This award funds the research activities of Professor James Gray at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.<br/><br/>Two theories underlie our understanding of modern physics: quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of gravity. Electrons experience gravity, however light they may be, and as such these quantum mechanical objects must fit within a gravitational theory. However, if one applies the usual rules of quantum mechanics to theories containing gravity, one gets nonsense. For example, the probability of certain events occurring, that is calculated in this way, turns out to be infinite. Many theories have been proposed to try and solve this problem. To date, by far the most successful is a theory called string theory. The idea is that instead of the fundamental building blocks of nature being particles, they are tiny, one dimensional, pieces of string. The troublesome probabilities mentioned above can be calculated to be proportional to one divided by the length of these strings. Thus one sees that, as one shrinks the length to zero and recovers a point like particle, one finds division by zero - an infinite answer. If the string length does not vanish, however, the theory can make sense. String theory comes with a very big catch. Mathematically, the theory only makes sense if the strings live in more than just three spatial dimensions. If some of the dimensions are wrapped up in some very small shape, we would not necessarily see them. Think of a piece of paper. This is clearly a two dimensional sheet. Now wrap the paper up into a cylinder and imagine furling it up more and more to make a smaller and smaller tube. If you could keep doing this (and if the paper was thin enough) then eventually the sheet would simply look like a line - a one dimensional object. The shape that the extra dimensions of string theory take determines the physics that someone living in the resulting three-dimensional universe would see. As an example, the volume of the shape determines the strength of gravity, as governed by Newton's constant. More subtle geometrical properties of the extra dimensions determine all of the rest of the physics of the resulting three-dimensional universe - for example, whether electrons exist and whether they carry electric charge. Given this, an obvious question arises. Is there a shape, which if used to hide the extra dimensions of string theory, gives rise to a three dimensional universe like our own? The answer to the question is still unknown. The proposed research is to use computers to study hundreds of millions of different possible shapes for the extra dimensions of string theory. In this way the PI will obtain a comprehensive survey of which three dimensional universes can be described by string theory. The PI will search this database to see if any of the shapes give rise to physics which is like that we see around us. The broader impact of this project will largely be through the technical training of graduate students, undergraduate researchers and a postdoctoral research assistant. Funding for six months of a postdoctoral researcher's tenure is included, with the other years and personnel involved being provided by resources from Virginia Tech. The PI plans to host an interdisciplinary workshop on computational algebraic geometry and string compactification at his home institution, to help develop links between these two different fields.<br/><br/>The project proposes to study compactifications of F-theory and heterotic string theory, which are currently the most promising candidates for reproducing known particle physics. Using modern formal methods of computational algebraic geometry, the PI will study large numbers of Calabi-Yau four- and three-fold compactifications of these theories in very fine detail. In addition, the PI will develop formalism to describe the moduli space and matter content of non-Kahler compactifications of heterotic theories. This work will try to answer two questions. First, can one find compactifications of string theory that reproduce not only the gauge group and particle content of the standard model, but also a realistic set of soft supersymmetry breaking terms? Second, if such compactifications can indeed be found, what are their common predictions for experimental observables that are yet to be measured? This research has the potential to advance mankind's knowledge of nature directly. It could help us understand whether string theory is simply a technical tool for studying some areas of mathematics and quantum field theory, or whether it is a fundamental physical theory of our universe. The work proposed will develop our understanding of string compactification on Calabi-Yau and non-Kahler manifolds in situations where the supergravity approximation is valid. The work on Calabi-Yau threefolds is designed to push the theory as close as possible to confrontation with experiment. The research on non-Kahler compactifications will lay the groundwork for more ambitious approaches to obtaining particle physics models from string theory in the future."
0.854597,"This award supports the University of California-Berkeley group to continue their participation in the newly completed IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole. The Berkeley group plays a leading role in calibrations, monitoring, simulations, operations, management, and other service tasks in addition to analyzing data. Over the period of this award the group will engage in a range of physics and astrophysics research. Using the newly available and powerful background veto capabilities of the cubic kilometer detector the group will measure atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades and search for a diffuse extraterrestrial flux of high-energy electron neutrinos. The goal is the first definitive detection of electromagnetic and hadronic particle showers initiated by interactions of high-energy neutrinos in a medium. They will search for violation of Lorentz-invariance and superluminal neutrinos using high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube to improve the current limit or find a violation using time-of-flight measurements with respect to gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae. Finally, they will use data from DeepCore, the low energy extension of IceCube, for high-statistics measurements probing the dark matter and neutrino oscillations sectors. These measurements will depend on precise knowledge of geometrical and optical detector and ice properties. The Berkeley group will extend their measurements of the optical properties of the deep ice with measurements of the scattering function and the properties of the columns of refrozen ice surrounding the optical sensors.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Members of the group will visit and give talks to students at nearby colleges with predominantly minority enrollments, to local groups of amateur astronomers, and to the general public. The PI will give talks to business leaders in the Bay Area and give talks and advise scientists in developing countries. Members of the group will communicate with reporters writing about science in the popular press and coordinate outreach activities involving the Teachers Experiencing Antarctica program and the Upward Bound program. The group is also involved in spin-off projects, through its inventions of novel instruments such as the optical dust logger and the biospectral logger. These projects advance our understanding of climate change and microbial life under extreme conditions close to those on Mars. The group will continue communications with glaciologists who use results from the Berkeley group's ice measurements to get a more complete understanding of glacial ice, and the movement and fate of the Antarctic ice sheet."
0.576,"This award provides base support for the particle astrophysics program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to participate in the Borexino solar neutrino experiment and the DarkSide project for the search of weakly interacting particle dark matter (WIMPs) in our galaxy. <br/><br/>Solar neutrinos have played a crucial role in the experimental confirmation that neutrinos have mass and oscillate. Since data acquisition started in 2007, Borexino has reached its design goal and measured the flux of mono-energetic 7-Beryllium solar neutrinos with enough precision to test the predictions of current solar models. After a scintillator purification campaign in 2011, Borexino is in a new phase of solar neutrino physics with the goal of measuring the entire solar neutrino spectrum. A precise knowledge of solar neutrinos will allow us to understand how the sun and other stars work, test the MSW-LMA neutrino oscillation paradigm and search for deviations from it. Borexino will possibly resolve an open question on the metallicity of the Sun's core, an important piece of information with which to study the evolution of larger stars in the universe. <br/><br/>DarkSide-50, a dual-phase time projection chamber scheduled to come online in late 2012, will prototype design solutions for background free multi-tonne detectors with liquid argon as active target for WIMPs. A null observation would exclude some of the current leading dark matter candidates. A positive detection would begin to give answers to one of the big scientific unknowns of our times. DarkSide-50 will run with 50 kg of argon depleted more than 100-fold in the radioactive 39-Argon isotope. The DarkSide-50 Argon cryostat is surrounded by a compact, liquid scintillator neutron detector and immersed in the Borexino Counting Test Facility (CTF) water tank instrumented and operated as a Cherenkov muon veto. The Borexino and DarkSide collaborations have a significant overlap in personnel and technical and operational resources. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Borexino and DarkSide projects provide excellent opportunities for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in applications of software and hardware development, and fundamental physics. The techniques developed for Borexino and Darkside-50 can more broadly benefit technology relevant for medical imaging, nuclear non-proliferation and geology."
0.239106,"This research program, located at an undergraduate institution, involves table-top experiments with lasers and atoms to gain insights into the so-called ""Standard Model of particle physics"" that is typically studied by physicists at large particle accelerator facilities. In the present work, properties of the metal atoms thallium and indium are measured to very high accuracy. Results are then compared to state-of-the-art theoretical calculations of these same properties, as high-quality tests of the fundamental physics phenomena probed by these measurements rely critically on the combination of precise experimental results reinforced by accurate, independent atomic structure calculations. Students become involved in all aspects of the experimental work, designing and testing laser, optical, and signal processing systems, and carrying out data collection and data analysis procedures.<br/><br/>Over recent decades, highly-precise atomic physics experiments using lasers have contributed important insights into the physics of the Standard Model of particle physics. Such low-energy physics tests complement accelerator-based experimental work. The small size of these effects demands very high precision, extensive study of systematic errors, and careful experimental design. Also, the size of these manifestations of high-energy physics in atoms scale dramatically with Z, the atomic number, suggesting the use of very heavy (and therefore complicated) atomic systems. Yet in order for these measurements in heavy atoms to provide unambiguous tests of the Standard Model, equally precise atomic theory models of the atomic wavefunctions are required to distinguish the ordinary quantum mechanical behavior from the ""exotic"" particle physics phenomena being targeted. The PI and his students are continuing with an ongoing series of diode laser spectroscopy measurements of the atomic properties of Group IIIA atoms (thallium, indium) which can be compared to state-of-the-art atomic theory calculations. They study atoms both in heated vapor cells as well as a dense, collimated atomic beam apparatus. These atoms contain three valence electrons, challenging the approximation techniques required to accurately compute wavefunctions. This experiment-theory interplay has resulted in significantly improved accuracy in recent years, and therefore improved atomic-physics-based tests of fundamental particle physics processes in these heavy atomic systems. In the longer term, the group is planning to perform a new experiment to measure the Weak Interaction in an atomic beam of thallium atoms, using its parity-violating optical rotation signature, improving upon an experimental result by a group that included the PI some years ago."
0.164957,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is to measure how the magnetic moments of quarks contribute to the total magnetic moment of the proton, along with contributions from other subatomic particles inside the proton. In addition, this grant will support research on an experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, labeled E989, which will precisely measure the magnetic moment of a fundamental particle, the muon, which is like an electron but with more mass. The goal of these experiments is to compare experimental result with theoretical predictions from the so-called Standard Model of Particle Physics. The studies described here will provide graduate students with the necessary tools and knowledge to obtain post-doctoral work at other large colliders or smaller non-accelerator based collaborations. Undergraduate students funded by this award will continue to have the rare opportunity to experience the scientific culture and participate in experiments at National Laboratories.<br/><br/>The studies of proton spin structure measurements will be carried out at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Longitudinally and transversely polarized proton beams necessary for these experiments are only available at RHIC. Jet reconstruction techniques will be used to measure asymmetries sensitive to the gluon helicity and quark transversity distributions. This award will also support the new g-2 experiment (E989) at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, which proposes to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment to 0.14 parts per million. A deviation from the Standard Model prediction at the observed level could be explained by several Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios and the improved precision will significantly constrain key parameters in supersymmetry, one of the most widely discussed BSM models."
0.065,"A fundamental goal of subatomic physics is the precise determination of the physical properties of subatomic particles. The radius of the proton is one of these properties. The radius can be measured by scattering electrons or muons from protons, or by measuring the energy levels of hydrogen or muonic hydrogen, an atom in which the electron is replaced by a muon. To date, the radius has been measured by scattering of electrons, and by the energy levels of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. The muonic measurements disagree with the electronic measurements, an issue known as ""the proton radius puzzle."" The discrepancy has attracted wide attention, because it may indicate the existence of previously unobserved and unexpected differences between the interactions of muons and electrons.<br/><br/>A dedicated MUon proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE), which will run at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland and directly compare the scattering of muons and electrons from protons, is highly anticipated by experts in the field for its potential to resolve the puzzle. This project will cover the prototyping and development of several crucial components of the MUSE experiment detectors. This project will involve the training of students and young scientists, at the undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and junior faculty levels. The institutions involved in this project have trained large numbers of students of each type, including from minority populations. The training they have received in the process of doing basic research has led to careers in a variety of areas, from medical physics to national security, in addition to continued work in fundamental physics research. The MUSE experiment will broaden the perspective of American students by having them work in an international collaboration at an international laboratory, which will prepare them effectively to become prominent global scientists of the next generation. With the broad interest in the proton radius puzzle, MUSE has the potential to be broadly inspirational beyond the current scientific community.<br/><br/>The experiment uses a mixed beam of electrons, muons, and pions. The measurement requires high precision and small systematic errors. This project will build and test the components of the detector system. These include scintillation fiber detectors to measure the trajectories of incoming particles, Cerenkov detectors for particle identification, GEM detectors for precise positioning, straw tube detectors for measuring the trajectories of scattered particles, and scintillation detectors for particle identification of the scattered particles. In addition, a liquid hydrogen target will be developed. Development and testing of these detectors will demonstrate that the required precision can be obtained."
0.251331,"This project supports the study of a new kind of ""superfluid"" (a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate) which not only flows without resistance (one of the characteristics of superfluids) but also presents magnetic order (like a bar magnet). This superfluid is made up of an atomic gas that is cooled to extremely low temperatures and confined by a so-called ""optical tweezer trap"" (created by laser light) within a vacuum chamber. The researchers supported by this project will examine the magnetic characteristics of this gaseous material, and also clarify ways in which the magnetism and superfluidity of this material influence one another. The broader goal of this work is to help understand materials better, in particular those materials where the theory of quantum mechanics plays a dominant role (such materials can be expected to be increasingly put to use, particularly when they involve short length scales such as in the microelectronics industry). Toward this goal, the magnetic superfluid studied here is a useful test subject, one for which all of the basic physics underlying the material properties is believed to be known, and to which one can apply very precise and sensitive measurement techniques. The project will take place at a public University, and will support the training of graduate students in that setting.<br/><br/>The project is focused on three specific aims. The first is to characterize magnons in magnetically ordered superfluids. These magnons are the elementary magnetic excitations of these materials. A variety of approaches, many based on directly imaging the propagation of magnon waves, will be used to measure the magnon energy, damping, magnetic moment, and nonlinearities, and also to clarify the role of long-range magnetic dipole interactions. The second aim of this project is to study the condensation of magnons within ferromagnetic superfluids, related to the phenomenon of magnon condensation in solid-state magnetic materials. The third aim is to study the influence of spatially varying magnetization (spin textures) on mass currents and spin currents. This work will study differences between the study of scalar superfluids and magnetically ordered superfluids, with the goal of identifying the basic processes in the hydrodynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (something one might call ""superfluid magnetohydrodynamics"")."
0.36,"From wildebeest herds to bacterial biofilms and every scale in between, how individuals self-assemble into large, spatially complex groups is a key problem in understanding collective behavior, multicellularity and development. The coordinated motion of individuals at the cellular level can drive the formation of higher-scale structure in tissues, organisms and populations. These phenomena arise statistically as cells modulate their direction and speed in response to both local and global cues. A full understanding of how collective behavior in cell populations arises has been difficult to achieve because the community currently lacks methods to physically probe sensory input, motor control, and group formation. Experiments examining the effect of specific mutations on single cell movement and group morphology have identified many important molecular players but lack the ability to probe the behavior of individuals within groups or physical aspects of motion production and coordination. While most current models of motile bacterial populations rely heavily on mechanical coupling between cells as a key driver of collective behavior, we have virtually no measurements of the effect of forces on cell movement or directionality in this context. <br/><br/>In this project the PI will study biophysical aspects of force production, motion control, and cell-cell coordination on the molecular to the multi-cellular level using the model social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. The three aims of the work seek to determine the role of physical forces in coordinating cell speed and directionality and to elucidate the properties of single-cell motility that drive starvation-based aggregation. The experiments that will be performed will generate a huge leap forward in our understanding of how individual cells move and how they coordinate their activities to form large scale, motile structures. This project lies firmly within the goals of the Physics of Living Systems program at the NSF by using physical measurements and analyses to understand the dynamics of living cells across spatial scales. The PI has developed a cross-disciplinary Integrated Science course and will use the next several years to improve the course's curriculum by making it more accessible to a larger audience of US college students and, once complete, spearhead efforts to publish a textbook for broad dissemination. In addition, many of the techniques and analyses developed as part of this proposal will serve the larger microbiological community and will be made freely available.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.48,"This collaborative award funds the research activities of Professors V.P. Nair and Alexios Polychronakos at the City College of the City University of New York and Professor Daniel Kabat at Lehman College of the City University of New York. <br/><br/>Gauge theories describe the interactions of all elementary particles. One particular gauge theory, known as Quantum Chromodynamics, describes the interactions of quarks and gluons. These are the elementary particles inside nuclei, which can bind to form nuclei as well as other yet-to-be-detected particles such as glueballs. While the interaction of quarks and gluons at very high energies is fairly well understood, a detailed understanding of how quarks and gluons bind together to form nuclei and glueballs, and why isolated quarks cannot exist (""quark confinement""), is far from complete. This research project will contribute in this direction by building on previously introduced techniques within the simpler context of gauge theories with two space dimensions. This research project will also develop new techniques for calculating the Casimir force, which arises from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and which is central to many techniques in nanomechanics. Finally, on another front, Professors Nair and Polychronakos will continue their work on statistical distributions of random matrices, with implications for a variety of questions from condensed-matter physics to quantum gravity. New physically observable quantities will be analyzed and their implications for quantum gravity will be explored.<br/><br/>This project will have significant broader impacts. Professors Kabat, Nair, and Polychronakos will involve undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers in their work, thereby providing critical training to these junior physicists. The project will also play an important role in fostering continuing collaboration between City College and Lehman College. Maintaining a joint research program has had a positive impact on attracting students to these research areas. Given the demographics of the two colleges, this has been particularly true for students from minority and under-represented groups."
0.76,"The Oregon group will continue its vigorous efforts aimed at discovery of gravitational waves with Advanced LIGO, working within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC). However, most importantly for the next three years, the Oregon group will apply to Advanced LIGO the deep expertise gained from the initial LIGO experience in detector characterization. In particular, our leadership in finding, describing, and mitigating noise sources which are not intrinsic to the LIGO interferometers will be crucial to the success of Advanced LIGO. And it is during this period of transition, as the new systems are being installed and commissioned, that these investigations will be most valuable. This will be carried out via two main avenues of inquiry: (1) detector characterization, and (2) data analysis, especially in developing strategies to search for gravitational wave transients associated with astrophysical triggers, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or supernovae. For detector characterization, the focus will be to interrogate Advanced LIGO sub-systems as they come on line. We will identify potentially problematic couplings of the LIGO interferometers to noise from the environment (electromagnetic, seismic, acoustic, cosmic-ray, etc), determine the physical character of the coupling, and use this knowledge to reduce or mitigate it. In data analysis and gravitational wave science, the Oregon group plans to continue to play a central role in developing strategies and analyses to search for astrophysically-triggered, transient gravitational wave signals. The overriding goal is to be ready with a full arsenal of analysis tools, including infrastructure to provide timely communication with astronomical partners, when Advanced LIGO begins science running. And as LIGO makes the transition from a discovery phase to a full program of gravitational wave science, the Oregon group will be poised to exploit the rich scientific opportunities available.<br/><br/>During the next three years, the quest for the discovery of gravitational waves -- a fundamental natural phenomenon predicted by Einstein's General Relativity -- will enter a critical phase. The LIGO project is transitioning to its ""advanced"" phase. Advanced LIGO, when complete in about three years, is expected to have the exquisite sensitivity required to directly detect gravitational wave signals for the first time. This discovery, when realized, will usher in a new era of astronomy and astrophysics, as gravitational waves will provide a unique view of the cosmos, distinct from that provided by light, radio, x-rays, gamma rays, neutrinos, or other astronomical messengers."
0.96,"The UWMLSC group will contribute several critical elements to create a low-latency streaming on-line search for transient gravitational waves, such as those produced during the coalescence of binary neutron stars or black holes, the most anticipated gravitational wave signal. Among the data analysis elements we will create are the streaming data calibration system, a low-latency system for determining data quality and glitch vetoing, and on-line searches for signals from inspiralling compact binaries and for generic unmodeled bursts. Such a system to rapidly identify signals will be an essential element of gravitational wave science in the Advanced Detector Era, and will enable multi-messenger astronomy in which observations of several kinds (gravitational waves; electromagnetic waves; high energy particles) are synthesized to obtain a detailed understanding of the sources of the most cataclysmic events in the universe. Gravitational wave astronomy will reveal the inner mechanism of the mysterious gamma ray bursts, will provide a means to measure the population of black holes and determine the channel by which massive black holes are grown, and will probe the fundamental nature of matter above nuclear densities. New ways of measuring cosmological parameters will become available, which will complement existing observations. Gravitational wave observations will also provide sensitive tests of Einstein's General Relativity in ways in which it has not yet been scrutinized. The opening of the gravitational wave window onto the universe can potentially evince exotic objects such as naked singularities, cosmic strings, or unexpected physics. We must be ready to address these scientific challenges as our new astronomical facilities come into operation. To this end, this award will support work that may result in the first gravitational wave discoveries of compact binary coalescence, provide rapid sky localization to facilitate electromagnetic follow-up efforts, yield fast turn-around targeted searches prompted by triggers generated by other observational facilities, obtain the the nuclear equation of state by measuring the tidal interactions of binary neutron stars just prior to their merger, observe black hole formation channels and probe fundamental properties of black holes through their quasi-normal modes of oscillation, scan the sky to find undiscovered rapidly rotating neutron stars and to learn about their properties, test cherished principles of gravitation such as the no-hair and cosmic-censorship conjectures, and seek new exotic and unexpected phenomena.<br/><br/>Our work supports the creation of critical components of a system that will allow the rapid transmittal of gravitational wave observations to the entire community of astronomers, and facilitates the integration of gravitational wave science into the broader field of astrophysics. The group has a solid track record of educating new researchers; this project will have a broad impact by training a new generation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty members in gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as conveying the excitement of this budding branch of astronomy to the community through outreach efforts such as the UWM Planetarium."
0.175,"This research program explores two of the primary noise sources in Advanced LIGO and other gravitational wave interferometers: upconversion noise and coating thermal noise. Coating thermal noise can be reduced by understanding and minimizing the mechanical loss in the mirror materials. Traditional high reflectivity coatings are multilayers of dielectric material, usually amorphous metal-oxides, with alternating high and low index. The materials that comprise the high-index layers are the primary source of mechanical loss; the low-index material is fused silica, which has an anomalously low loss among amorphous dielectric materials. In this research program, the PI seeks to develop a stabilized, high index material with a coefficient of thermal expansion matched to the low index material, so that the loss of the composite coating can be reduced through high temperature annealing. In addition, crystalline coatings, such as Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs), have been shown to have a mechanical loss about a factor 10 lower than most amorphous dielectric coatings. The AlGaAs coating could be developed as mirror materials for the 1.5 micron lasers planned for third generation detectors. However, current samples have been limited to the centimeter scale. This research program will explore the source of mechanical loss in these crystalline coatings including any issues related to the scaling and application of the coatings for large optics. Finally, upconversion noise is the coupling of low frequency noise, primarily seismic noise, into the detection band of the interferometer. Upconversion noise can be difficult to characterize because the noise peak is located at the sum or difference of the frequencies of the coupled mechanisms. This research program will develop a data analysis tool that will use bicoherence, the higher order form of coherence, to determine the sources of the upconverted noise. <br/><br/>Coating thermal noise is the leading noise source in the central frequency band of Advanced LIGO and is a primary limit to overall detector sensitivity. Reducing coating thermal noise leads to a direct increase in the detector sensitivity and a cubed increase in its expected event rate. Thus even a small reduction in the noise is important. A significant improvement in coating noise will hasten the day when LIGO will make a direct detection of gravitational waves and launch the era of gravitational wave astronomy. Beyond the study of gravitational waves, coating thermal noise has now become an important noise source in other areas of physics, including precision optics and in precision experiments that utilize microresonators. Finally, with the lower noise floor of Advanced LIGO, upconversion is expected to be a much more prominent noise source than in Initial LIGO. The commissioning teams will welcome a tool that can identify these noise peaks with their source. And since upconversion is a common noise problem within the precision physics community, the development of an effective tool could be useful well beyond the gravitational wave community."
0.355,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Doreen Wackeroth at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.<br/><br/>Particle physics research has entered an exciting era: The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is successfully colliding proton beams at energies that allow for the exploration of matter and the laws of physics that govern its properties at the most fundamental level. Despite the enormous success of the Standard Model (SM) in describing all experimentally observed electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions of the constituents of matter, it is generally accepted that the SM is merely a low-energy approximation to a more fundamental theory which is expected to reveal itself at the LHC in form of the emergence of new, non-SM particles and interactions. Moreover, there is still one prediction of the SM that awaits experimental confirmation: the existence of a Higgs particle, which is thought to be associated with the observed phenonenon of electroweak symmetry breaking. If the SM Higgs boson exists, it will not escape detection at the LHC. However, in order to extract meaningful information from LHC data, the theoretical predictions for relevant LHC processes must be of a precision that exceeds anticipated experimental precision. This project will therefore consist of improving the current predictions for such processes. Specifically, the PI will perform calculations of cross sections at higher orders in perturbation theory and implement these improved calculations in Monte Carlo programs.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The proposed calculations are challenging and will provide the graduate students involved with an advanced research experience and with skills valuable beyond the scope of particle-physics research. These research activities will be pursued in collaboration with scientists worldwide, and will further US-international joint scientific efforts. The PI will also continue to organize activities involving the Physics Department's Physics & Arts Exhibition, which aims to convey the excitement of fundamental research to K-12 and undergraduate students as well as to the general public."
0.16,"This award funds the research of Professor Paolo Gondolo at the University of Utah. The central question addressed in the research is the nature of dark matter, a mysterious substance introduced to explain the measured motion of gas and stars in galaxies, the gravitational force in galaxy clusters, and the formation of galaxies out of the tiny lumps observed in the early universe. It has by now been established that dark matter cannot be made of any known particles. Many theoretical ideas exist for dark matter as a new elementary particle, and many experiments are being performed to test these theories. Professor Gondolo's group studies some of these theories, with the aim of understanding their validity and the ways to test them, and at the same time providing the science community with publicly-accessible assessment tools of theories and experiments. The discovery of dark matter particles, and therefore the direct confirmation of the existence of dark matter, would be a completion of the Copernican revolution, and would be the empirical foundation that the material substance humans are made of is only a minority component of the universe.<br/><br/>Technically, the research funded by this award addresses the question of the nature of dark matter by (1) providing state-of-the-art and user-friendly software tools to the particle dark matter community for the computation of cosmic densities and direct and indirect signals from generic models of weakly-interacting massive particles, (2) assess the nuclear physics uncertainties in the predictions of galactic cosmic ray fluxes as backgrounds to the indirect detection of dark matter particles, (3) supply proper statistical meaning to astrophysics-independent analyses of direct dark matter detection data, and (4) unify and complete the theory of generic dark matter scattering off atomic nuclei. The educational component of this award continues a very successful physics outreach program at the local museum and in local schools, seeking to attract young students to science in a fun, energetic, and engaging way so as to ultimately increase the number of responsible citizens and leaders who can address the major issues of our time with basic knowledge of science."
0.297292,"This grant supports research that seeks to answer a fundamental question about matter. What is the nature of any new physics not described by the Standard Model - our current understanding of how particles and forces interact? This question will be addressed by precision measurements of the weak charges of the proton and electron.

Any deviation of measurements from these predictions could be evidence of as yet undiscovered massive particles that represent new physics beyond our existing understanding. <br/><br/>The grant will support graduate and undergraduate students who will form an essential part of this project. The anticipated activities cover a range of hardware and software projects that will provide excellent training for these students. This training in fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers both in basic research and in more applied research and industry.<br/><br/>The funds provided by this grant will support activities on two parity-violating electron scattering experiments at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF). The Qweak experiment will measure the proton's neutral weak charge via parity-violating electron scattering at very low momentum transfer. The proton's weak charge has a well-defined prediction in the Standard Model; a precise measurement of it is sensitive to many popular scenarios for extending the Standard Model. During the period of this grant, we will perform data analysis leading to the final determination of the proton's weak charge from the Qweak experiment. We will also perform analysis to extract physics results from the Qweak data for two other topics - a probe of hadronic parity violation in the N to Delta transition and a measurement of the transverse asymmetry in Moller scattering.<br/><br/>The MOLLER experiment is an approved TJNAF experiment intended for the upgraded 12 GeV TJNAF. It will measure the electron's neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at a very low momentum transfer. This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders. It would have excellent sensitivity to many beyond the Standard Model scenarios. During the period of this grant, our group will contribute to the development of this experiment by working on beam charge and position monitor upgrades, luminosity monitor and background detector development and construction, and simulation design studies."

HAWC will map TeV gamma-ray sources with daily coverage of half the sky. The observation of Galactic and extragalactic TeV gamma-ray sources with HAWC and the measurement of their energy spectra will greatly enhance our understanding of the origin of cosmic rays. HAWC will also map the arrival direction distribution of TeV cosmic rays with unprecedented sensitivity and help us understand the large- and small-scale structure observed in cosmic-ray sky maps. The observation of distant blazars will constrain the extragalactic background light and the intergalactic magnetic field, which may have been formed during primordial phase transitions in the early Universe.<br/><br/>The group at UW-Madison is participating in the development of the trigger and readout electronics, the data acquisition, and the development of the analysis software.

0.495,"Proton high energy structure and the high energy proton-proton interaction depend on the spin and angular momentum of the underlying quarks and gluons. Unique tools are available at the Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which make it possible to study the role of the spin of the proton constituents in polarized proton collisions. RHIC is the first high energy polarized proton collider, where experimentalists can prepare the spin orientation of high energy protons before they collide. These polarized proton collisions are studied in the STAR detector with center of mass energies up to 500 GeV. When relativistic protons collide, they produce high energy fragments including neutral pions, etas and jets of particles. It is in the very forward region where particle production is most sensitive to the orientation of the proton spin. This research involves measurement of forward fragments in relativistic proton-proton collisions. In particular, transverse spin dependence is studied using a lead-glass calorimeter called the FMS, which is located in the forward region of the STAR detector. The goal is to characterize the dependence of this production on event kinematics. We test QCD related predictions of how the spin of the proton correlates with the spin of quarks and how this can modify the observable cross sections. This grant supports the collection of new RHIC FMS data and the analysis of that data. The objective is better understanding of the most basic questions about the nature of the proton.<br/><br/><br/>The proton is understood to consist of quarks and gluons bound together by the strong force.

These measurements will help to understand the new state of matter, a plasma of quarks, that is formed from such collisions. In particular, the results of this measurement are expected to probe the initial conditions of quarks and other strongly-interacting particles in the nucleus before the collision. In recent years, we have learned that the initial conditions of the quarks before the collision result in hot-spots within the quark-gluon plasma, and how these hot-spots spread their energy within the plasma provides information on this new state of matter. It is worth noting that this research program is carried out at an undergraduate institution, Muhlenberg College, and is a highlight of the Physics Department. Most of the physics majors have participated in it by the time of their graduation. Furthermore, almost all of the participants have chosen to continue in STEM fields after graduation.<br/><br/>Theorists have suggested that measurements of transverse energy are a barometer of a state of saturated plasma. Both studies of existing data from a relativistic heavy ion collisions (RHIC) experiment, called the beam energy scan, by the PHENIX Collaboration and work on transverse energy in the forward and backward kinematic regions are testing gluon-saturation models in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. To date, transverse energy in the forward and backward kinematic regions has not been reported. Associated with regions of higher net baryon chemical potential on the phase diagram of nuclear matter, these measurements, along with existing transverse energy measurements at central rapidity for a variety of colliding systems and beam energies, provide new insight into the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma."
0.165,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant aims to study of the structure of the proton. More specifically, we scatter electrons from protons at Jefferson Laboratory to measure the electric and magnetic properties of the proton. Our group is involved in these efforts through the design of new experiments, the construction of advanced particle detectors, and the development of novel analysis and modeling software. We involve students by providing meaningful, substantive projects to both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Our group's long established program of experiments embody Jefferson Lab's primary mission: to elucidate the underlying structure of protons, neutrons, and mesons. We focus on experiments which will further our understanding of the quark spin structure of the proton in the non-perturbative regime. Jefferson Lab has recently completed an upgrade to electron beams of energy 12 GeV, and our group is now poised to take advantage of the increased physics reach. We continue to lead the efforts to extend the measurement of the proton electromagnetic form factor ratio to the highest momentum transfers possible at Jefferson Lab, and also investigate the possible modification of this form factor ratio within the nuclear medium. These experiments will provide severe tests of the available theoretical models of proton structure, and will serve as a strong impetus for the development of more advanced models based upon quantum chromodynamics (QCD)."
0.069998,"This award provides funding for an RUI research project carried out by Professor Dimitra Karabali at the Lehman College campus of the City University of New York (CUNY). The project addresses two topics. The first focuses on the Casimir effect, a phenomenon where neutral objects in vacuum experience macroscopic forces due to the quantum fluctuations of fields. These forces, although negligible at large distances, become dominant and play an important role at distance scales relevant in the design of nano-scale mechanical devices. Accurate experimental observations of this phenomenon have motivated new theoretical approaches in dealing with the effects of different geometries, temperature, etc. As part of her research, Professor Karabali will continue her studies of the Casimir forces and in particular contributions from diffraction due to boundary edges in a variety of settings. The second topic focuses on the understanding of nonperturbative phenomena in quantum Chromodynamics, the theory describing the interactions between quarks and gluons, the fundamental constituents of atomic nuclei. She will continue her work by building on previously introduced techniques within the context of quantum wave equations towards understanding confinement. This project is expected to have significant broader impacts. Specifically, it will play an important role in fostering an active, scientifically oriented research environment at Lehman College, CUNY, a predominantly undergraduate institution with a large number of minority students, designated as a Hispanic serving institution by the U.S. Department of Education. It will also support collaboration between the high-energy theory research groups at Lehman and at City College, CUNY.<br/><br/>The project addresses diffractive contributions in Casimir effect and nonperturbative phenomena in (2+1) Yang-Mills theory. Accurate experimental observations of the Casimir effect have motivated new theoretical approaches in dealing with the effects of different geometries, temperature etc. The PI and collaborators have developed a novel approach well-suited to studying diffractive corrections to Casimir energy due to boundary edges and apertures for different geometries, finite temperature and general boundary conditions. This project will extend this method towards: the calculation of higher-point functions important inner field imaging and transmission; the inclusion of fields with spin with possible applications to the field of spectral geometry; the dependence of the interaction energy between holes on conducting plates on curvature (both extrinsic and intrinsic), spin and geometry. The understanding of nonperturbative phenomena in Yang-Mills theories, such as confinement and mass gap, is one of the outstanding problems in theoretical physics. In a series of papers, the PI and collaborators have developed a Hamiltonian approach for Yang-Mills theories in (2+1) dimensions, which has already produced a number of interesting results, in good agreement with lattice calculations. Recently the vacuum wave function obtained in the Hamiltonian formalism has been used to derive an effective action, which, being covariant, renders certain questions more amenable to analysis. This project will explore the properties of this effective action and in particular the role of the Z_N vortices, present in a sector of this action, in understanding screening versus confinement for different representations as well as the spectrum of the excited states of the theory and implications on glueball masses."
0.15,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Simone Giombi at Princeton University.<br/><br/>One of the key developments in string theory has been the discovery of surprising dualities relating quantum gravitational theories to gauge theories. Professor Giombi's research program is aimed at a broad and thorough study of various aspects of the gauge/gravity duality. This work will deepen our fundamental understanding of the physics underlying the relation between gauge and gravitational theories, and exploit the gauge/gravity duality in order to develop a powerful toolbox for answering non-perturbative questions about strongly coupled gauge theory or the nature of quantum gravity. This project consists of three key areas. The first one is devoted to a deep study of the gravitational theories involving massless higher spin fields and their role in the gauge/gravity duality; the second is to better understand the quantization of string theory in Anti de Sitter (AdS) backgrounds, and the third involves the study of certain supersymmetric subsectors of non-abelian gauge theories where exact results are possible by the method of localization.<br/><br/>This project is also expected to have a number of broader impacts. While working on specific research problems, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will receive extensive mentoring and training which will positively contribute to their formation as future independent scientists. The PI intends to develop special classes for graduate students and advanced undergraduates about recent trends in theoretical physics research, and to lecture at schools for students and young researchers held at international institutes. The PI also plans to become active in various outreach programs, such as giving public lectures and communicating recent research advances to non-technical journals."
0.415,"Marjatta Lyyra's research group at Temple University is supported by the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics Program to carry out a series of fundamental studies of the interaction of light with small molecules in the frequency domain. Her group has developed applications of quantum optics for molecular systems including electromagnetically induced transparency and the Autler-Townes (AT) effect. These studies have facilitated a shift of quantum optics studies to molecular systems with practical applications as the goal. <br/><br/>The complex molecular energy level structure, molecular interactions, and relaxation pathways provide a rich testing ground of coherence effects for controlling molecular dynamics and quantum state character. Through combined experimental and theoretical studies her research group has demonstrated control of molecular angular momentum alignment, for example. Another important application of the Autler-Townes effect is its use as a precision probe of the internuclear distance-dependent transition dipole moment functions, which are at the heart of the interaction of light with molecules. These measurements rely on the measurement of the Autler-Townes splitting from the lineshape of the control laser transition combined with an accurate measurement of the electric field amplitude of this laser. Another application of the AT effect involves external optical control over the mixing between a pair of closely-spaced molecular singlet and triplet eigenstates that are weakly perturbed by the spin-orbit interaction. The AT effect causes the nominal singlet level to split into a pair of field modified levels, one of which tunes closer to the triplet, resulting in increased singlet-triplet mixing, and the other farther from the triplet, resulting in decreased singlet-triplet mixing. Thus this optical control mechanism can be used to ""tune"" the spin-orbit mixing coefficients and as a result control quantum state singlet and triplet character.<br/><br/>In addition to developing new applications of quantum interference and coherence effects, this research bridges traditionally separate research communities: molecular spectroscopy and dynamics on one hand, and quantum optics and control on the other hand. Due to the fundamental nature of this research the results are broadly applicable. Examples include finding optimal excitation pathways for ultracold molecule formation and role of valence electron spin polarization in photochemistry.<br/><br/>In this project, young scientists, many of whom are women, participate in forefront scientific research at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels and as a result develop critical experience and confidence for their future participation in the scientific and technical workforce."
0.135,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this award is to measure the quark structure of light particles called mesons. The proposed research will support the research infrastructure by commissioning new equipment to produce linearly a beam of high-energy photons from scattered electrons produced by the accelerator at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). The research will also include computer simulations of the particle detector in Hall D at Jefferson Lab. Participation of students in the research effort is a central component of this program.<br/><br/>The experimental program proposed here embodies one of Jefferson Lab's priorities: to elucidate the underlying structure of protons, neutrons, and mesons. The particles of interest here are called hybrid mesons, which are identified as having quantum numbers not allowed in the constituent quark model, due to extra degrees of freedom provided by gluons, which are the force-carriers of the strong force. The discovery of hybrid mesons would be a triumph of modern theoretical models based on the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This award will also provide support for personnel to commission the linearly polarized photon beam and the electron tagger as part of the GlueX experiment In Hall D of Jefferson Lab."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.<br/><br/>CDMS is currently operating at the Soudan underground laboratory in Minnesota with 10 kg of novel iZIP detectors that have already demonstrated a background rejection factor sufficient for zero background operation with several hundred kg targets. This high background rejection and control of contamination that the SuperCDMS technology offers provide significant advantages compared to other technologies, providing excellent sensitivity to low mass dark matter, competitive sensitivity to high-mass WIMPS, and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment. The SCU team will continue to play a central role in the testing and characterization efforts at Stanford, including bringing online, maintaining, upgrading and/or operating three Stanford fridges. The PI will devote approximately 25% of her time on long-term R&D that could impact a future experiment, for example in the area of code-division-multiplexing for SQUID-based readouts<br/><br/>This grant will support research and training opportunities for students at several levels to work on an experiment that will address one of the most fundamental problems of modern science, the nature of dark matter. SCU undergraduates will complete laboratory-based work for CDMS primarily in the areas of detector fabrication, testing and optimization."
0.475,"Topological structures are central to many different branches of physics, at a variety of different energy and length scales. Quantized vortices, for example, express the rotational properties of a superfluid system; and, cosmologically, Dirac monopoles have long been sought in the magnetic field since evidence for their existence has implications for the quantization of charge. Here, several experimental aspects of topological structures in the pristine and highly controllable context of dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates are explored. The dynamics of small clusters of interacting quantized vortices and their response to changing environmental conditions, including temperature and the strength of the interatomic interactions, are explored using real-time imaging techniques under development as a central part of the project. More exotic topological structures in spinor condensates are also sought for study, including merons (two-component vortex ""molecules"") and Dirac monopoles.<br/><br/>Research on topological structures engages fundamental problems in basic physics and the nature of the world. Progress toward answering these questions contributes to the understanding of increasingly complex phenomena and ultimately to its application to problems of significance. Here, one might envision a study of superfluid rotation as leading to the creation of more sensitive rotation detectors. Of more direct and immediate benefit is the emphasis on education and training of undergraduates of diverse backgrounds in the performance of cutting-edge research in physics. This training takes place much earlier than is typical of research universities. The participating students then become active members of the next generation of scientists and citizens."
0.4277,"Solar neutrino research has already discovered massive neutrinos and flavor mixing, and is moving into an era where precision measurements can tell us about the inner workings of the Sun. The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle is one of the fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium, releasing electron-neutrinos. Should this next period allow the Borexino detector to measure the CNO neutrino flux sufficiently well to infer the metallicity (the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium) of the sun's interior, it could test the fundamental assumption of homogeneity in the sun and provide crucial information regarding opacities in the solar interior that are important for helioseismology. Such studies could thus have a great impact on our understanding of the sun, stellar astrophysics, the link between planetary and stellar formation, as well as basic neutrino physics. <br/><br/>This award provides funding for the continuing role of Virginia Tech in the Borexino experiment, the world's purest large-volume liquid scintillator detector located at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, designed to measure the principle components of the neutrino spectrum coming from the Sun as it converts hydrogen into helium through fusion. They have measured the 7-Be, 8-B, and pep neutrino fluxes from the Sun, and set a limit on the CNO neutrino flux. The next three-year period with ultra-low background requires re-calibration to verify these results, and to prepare the collaboration to move into a new 'CNO focused' phase. The principle physics goals are 1) measurement of the CNO neutrino flux, 2) more precise results for the 7-Be and pep neutrino flux, and 3) a better result for the pp neutrino flux. <br/><br/>The broader impact on science, technology and outreach that is expected from the program includes: the training of graduate and undergraduate students in current topical physics research; experience with deployment and utilization of ultra-clean calibration techniques; presentations of this research program to undergraduates, through research projects, student presentations, lectures, and problems - exposing the next generation of scientists from multiple fields to the excitement of astroparticle physics; and a broad engagement of the neutrino community through their Center for Neutrino Physics."
0.480607,"We are pursuing two experiments at Amherst College. The first project is a continuation of our experiment to test Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI) and CPT invariance. LLI is the notion that the laws of physics are the same in all locally inertial frames and independent of their orientation in space. CPT is the product of the discrete symmetries charge conjugation, parity and time. No violation of either LLI or CPT has ever been observed. Much of our understanding of fundamental physics would have to be radically altered if a violation is observed. We compare the relative precession frequencies of Hg and Cs magnetometers as a function of the orientation of an applied magnetic field with respect to the ""fixed stars"". This comparison is sensitive to LLI violating couplings between a preferred universal frame and the electron, neutron and proton spins. With our recently completed experiment, we have placed new limits on several LLI violating terms. It has been pointed out that these limits may actually probe physics on the Planck scale, where String Theory suggests that violations might occur. We indend to replace the magnetometers with ones of a new design that should be at least a factor of twenty more sensitive. At this level, the experiment will provide the most stringent heavy-atom test of several possible mechanisms for violating LLI and CPT.<br/><br/>In our second project we are exploring the possibility of laser cooling thallium fluoride (TlF) using a transition between the v=0, J=1 of the ground state to the v'=0,J'=1 state of the triplet B state. Methods to cool molecules using lasers have only recently achieved some level of success. The difficulty with laser-cooling of molecules stems from the myriad of possible states available for decay. It is hard to find a cycling transition which will allow the tens of thousands of absorption/emission cycles that are required to achieve significant cooling. In recent work, we have demonstrated that with only one cooling laser and one repump laser it should be possible to achieve several thousand photon cycles on this transition without significant loss to other levels. This should allow transverse cooling and collimation of a cryogenic beam. Here, we intend to make precision measurements of the other critical Franck-Condon factors. Their determination will tell us precisely how many repump lasers would be required to bring a cryogenic beam of the TlF to rest. We also intend to measure the B state hyperfine structure (HFS) and isotope shifts. The HFS plays a critical role in determining the rate of loss to other rotational levels. If the laser cooling and trapping of TlF is possibile, this would open up the possibility of performing a high-precision search for the electric dipole moment of the Tl nucleus. Such an experiment is sensitive to the Schiff moment of the Tl nucleus which is in turn sensitive to the proton edm and time-reversal violation in the nuclear interaction.<br/><br/>Both of these projects have as their long-term goal the investigation of the fundamental symmetries of nature. Even though they are relatively modest table-top experiments, they have important possible implications for particle physics. The local Lorentz invariance experiment can provide limits on String Theory while a future thallium fluoride (TlF) electric-dipole moment experiment would test time-reversal symmetry in the proton and in the nuclear interaction. These projects, using the precision techniques of atomic and laser physics, provide a broad and flexible training for future scientists. The TlF experiment will expose our students to the exciting and emerging field of the laser-cooling of molecules. This project nicely compliments both the BEC work being done here by Prof. David Hall and the uv laser development that is being pursued by our new assistant Professor David Hanneke as part of his work on trapping single ions. Our fundamental symmetries experiments at Amherst have drawn many talented undergraduates into careers in physics over the last 29 years. This project will continue our tradition of pursuing state of the art experiments while providing exciting research opportunities and valuable training for undergraduates."

Each of these investigations will use fully quantum mechanical methods to describe detailed interactions involving hydrogen and helium.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research include applications to:<br/>(i) Astrophysical environments such as photodissociation regions where hydrogen molecular clouds are far from thermal equilibrium, and primordial gas where a significantly improved theoretical account of molecular hydrogen is needed to simulate population III star formation,<br/>(ii) Ultracold environments such as buffer-gas traps where trapped van der Waals complexes may open up new avenues of research in few-body physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and cluster physics, and <br/>(iii) Industrial environments where processes such as heterogeneous catalysis might benefit from an atomic and molecular perspective. The broader impacts also include the development of human resources and educational outreach activities. Students will be given their first exposure to scientific research. General education and outreach talks will be given that relate the research activities with topics of interest to the public. The project is designed to integrate research, teaching, and educational outreach and provide an excellent opportunity for undergraduates to begin training for science and engineering careers."
0.268469,"In this project, the PI will study the group behavior of photosynthetic bacteria that are growing in biofilms and in dense populations. The photosynthetic bacteria that are the subjects of this study, the anoxygenic phototroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, collectively carry out all major modes of metabolism that exist in the bacterial world. The PI will study the effects of different growth pressures on the pattern formation of these bacteria. The PI will grow and analyze the architecture of biofilms that are formed by photosynthetic bacteria which are growing in different metabolic modes. Mathematical models will be developed and compared to experiment to understand the physical principles that underlie the observed growth patterns. Experiments will also be performed to analyze in detail the collective motion of photosynthetic bacteria that are growing at high cell population densities, with system modifications inspired by photosynthetic biofilms. The research will explore a new range of parameter space for biologic pattern formation and collective bacterial motion, providing experimental evidence with which theoretical and simulational models may be compared. This research will be undertaken in an undergraduate-only institution and involves interdisciplinary faculty and student collaborations in applied physics and microbiology. Undergraduate students will be trained in techniques at the interface of these fields, will be co-authors on publications, and students will be expected to present results of this research at local and national meetings. The techniques and finding from this research will be used in the classroom in teaching of biology and physics, and the techniques developed and data obtained from this research will stimulate the development of future interdisciplinary courses."

The workshop will discuss how to get the most out of the data we expect to obtain in the next few years from the NICER telescope, the Event Horizon telescope and the advanced LIGO/Virgo detectors. The format of the workshop will be relatively informal to encourage a collaborative atmosphere, in analogy to the one hosted in 2013 at MSU on gravitational wave tests of General Relativity. The workshop will have four focus sessions on neutron star observations and the equation of state, black hole shadows, gravitational wave astrophysics and experimental relativity.<br/><br/>The workshop will take place on August 20 - 22, 2015 at the Alumni Foundation of Montana State University. Each day will be divided into two subset, each of which will cover a single topic, for a total of six topics. These will include neutron star astrophysics and observations, the neutron star equation of state, NICER astrophysics, gravitational wave astrophysics, the Event Horizon telescope, and experimental relativity with gravitational waves and with cosmology. The workshop is expected to be small (of order 50 people) so as to increase the participation of all attendees. A few overview talks will be planned for each day, where the discussion leader will summarize the most recent successes in each topic and present questions that still need to be addressed. The overviews will act as a catalyst for discussions and exchange of ideas."
0.105,"This award funds a collaborative research program involving two separate angular correlation measurements with neutrons. These measurements will enable us to extract fundamental information concerning the weak interaction which causes neutron decay, including the axial coupling constant of the nucleon. This coupling constant appears in a very wide variety of nuclear and particle physics contexts, from being a critical input to high precision calculations of the solar fusion rates, to being a target for higher precison lattice QCD calculations, to placing, together with the neutron lifetime, limits on the existence of new particle physics interactions.<br/><br/>The first experiment, UCNA, measures the beta-asymmetry, or the correlation between the neutron polarization and the decay beta-particle's momentum. UCNA is the first experiment to use ultracold neutrons, or neutrons with energies below about 300 neV that can be stored in material bottles, for this kind of measurement. Ultracold neutrons have advantages both for neutron polarimetry and neutron-generated backgrounds, key sources of systematic error in existing neutron angular correlation experiments. The UCNA experiment is currently operating, with one more run period planned at the neutron densities currently available at the Los Alamos ultracold neutron source. The targeted precision is below 0.4%, roughly a factor of 2 more precise than the current world average for the beta-asymmetry. The second experiment, Nab, uses an unpolarized beam of cold neutrons (with temperatures near 30K) to measure the electron-neutrino angular correlation, with a planned sensitivity at about the 0.1% level for the electron-neutrino correlation. This experiment should also be able to place important limits on extensions to the standard model of particle physics for scalar and<br/>tensor couplings.<br/><br/>Key to the success of these experiments is the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral scholars. These young scientists will receive excellent training in experimental techniques, particle detectors, and data analysis."
1.148855,"Neutrinos from the Sun are ideal for studying neutrino-flavor phenomena and astrophysics. The Sun offers the greatest source flux of a pure electron-neutrino flavor coupled with high matter density in neutrino transport, long baseline, and low neutrino energies. An effective tool for new advances compares the luminosity of the Sun separately measured by neutrinos and photons that can uncover surprises in neutrino physics as well as astrophysics. A precision measurement of the neutrino-derived luminosity of the Sun is possible only by the detection of low-energy (<2 MeV) solar neutrinos that contain > 99.9% of the flux. One of the few answers to the experimental challenge of real-time low-energy neutrino detection is the indium-based Low Energy Solar Neutrino Spectrometer, LENS. It will uniquely provide a nearly background-free complete spectral image of solar neutrinos using Charged-Current-based neutrino detection with powerful tags of space and time coincidences. <br/><br/>This award will provide funds to test the LENS concept and technology in all its aspects via a relatively inexpensive prototype - Mini-LENS - at 15% of the length-scale (1/300 the volume) of LENS, with the goal of providing a robust characterization of the performance of the technology. <br/><br/>The broader impact on science, technology and education includes: the participation of students and postdocs with opportunities and outlets for curiosity- and imagination-driven research into a physics understanding of the world with simulations, chemical processing, and data acquisition systems.

Convenient access to the underground laboratory at Kimballton provides excellent training in the intricacies of research underground. The technology of mini-LENS reaches into other realms, and provides new opportunities in other fields."
0.921,"Measurements of the solar neutrino spectrum have already yielded unexpected results of fundamental importance and, as these measurements improve, new results promise to be equally revealing. Neutrino oscillations, coupled with the MSW mechanism, are required to explain the observed neutrino fluxes at Earth. This solution allows an interesting region between vacuum- and matter-enhanced oscillations where additional new physics can be probed. Likewise, recent solar abundance measurements have created conflicts between the Standard Solar Model and helioseismology results, which are most sensitively resolved by measurement of the CNO neutrino flux. Significantly, there also remains the question whether the luminosity of the sun, as determined by photons, accurately matches the luminosity as determined by neutrinos. In this case, a direct measurement of the pp neutrinos is also required. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding for this group to continue their participation in the science arena of Borexino in the underground laboratory at Gran Sasso, Italy as the collaboration focuses on measuring the Beryllium-7 neutrino flux. The group actively participated and provided expert manpower to Borexino purification efforts. Results from the first pass of purification have been very successful, and when completed in the coming year, Borexino looks well poised to provide meaningful measurements of the CNO and pep fluxes as well. Future possibilities include measurements of the pp neutrino flux with the LENS experiment. <br/><br/>This award will provide excellent training of, and experience for, the students and postdocs who work in the program as well as potential applications of these technologies outside of the field."

0.87,"This project focuses on strongly correlated phases of cold-atomic systems in optical lattices where collective behavior is governed by laws of quantum mechanics. The prototypical strongly correlated fermionic systems -- the Hubbard model and resonant fermions in the regime of BCS-BEC crossover -- are central in the fields of the cold atom research and condensed matter. Understanding quantum plasticity and super transport in solid 4He remains one of big challenges in modern low-temperature physics. There is urgent need for universal unbiased first-principles methods for strongly correlated fermionic systems across all fields of physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. Ab initio and model simulations provide crucial information about quantitative and qualitative properties of these systems, test analytical predictions and help establish the proper theoretical framework, lay the ground for the unambiguous analysis of experimental data and further development of measuring techniques. In particular, this project aims to (i) develop generic diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) tools for continuous-space and lattice fermionic/fermionized systems: resonant fermions, Hubbard model, and frustrated spin systems, (ii) understand quantum plasticity and supertransport in solid helium-4, (iii) perform Worm Algorithm (WA) studies of quantum-critical phenomena and novel phases of ultra-cold atoms: deconfined criticality, universal critical dynamics, phases of multi-bound complexes of polar molecules.<br/><br/>An unbiased theoretical description of collective quantum phenomena is of vital interdisciplinary importance for a number of applied and fundamental areas, such as quantum computing and high-energy physics. High-end computing methods and techniques often find applications outside the physics community. Simulations of complex models with multiple constraints, randomness, and a variable number of continuous parameters are typical in polymer science, neural networks, computer science, behavioral, social and economics studies. The algorithms developed in the project provide an example of how some of the difficulties may be circumvented. An integral part of the project is the training of graduate students and post-doctoral associate in advanced numeric techniques, quantum statistics, topical problems of atomic and solid state physics, network administration, and parallel supercomputing."

The largest enclosed area electron interferometer ever will be built, and electron switches directing signals at extreme rates of about a million GigaHertz will be explored.<br/><br/><br/> The impact of having a largest electron interferometer (that still fits in a car) is that new frequency ranges and sensitivities of electromagnetic fields can be tested. The use of a simple low frequency magnetometer is explored together with Honeywell and these devices are applicable for hunting submarines and locating mines. Higher frequencies are used for detecting electromagnetic communications. On the scientific side, the interferometer will be used to help understand one of the largest puzzles of the century, which is the transition between classical and quantum physics. The impact of having ultrafast electron switches is that this may enable a new generation of devices, such as the fastest microscopes, oscilloscopes and signal processors. The educational impact is that training for graduate students will be provided in an area of national need, while previous outreach has already reached an estimated 100,000 high school students. This grant will allow a continuation of these efforts."
0.060571,"This research project is focused on two highly rated experimental projects at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Virginia. One experiment will measure the proton radius, one of the most fundamental quantities in physics. It is directly related to the structure of the proton, which is a basic constituent block of visible matter. This research will continue the development and construction of a novel hydrogen target to perform a new electron-proton scattering experiment, directly giving the proton radius with higher precision. The second project will measure the lifetime of a particle called the eta meson with high precision, which will be compared with theoretical predictions from the fundamental theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This project will also provide unique opportunities for students, both undergraduate and graduate, to be actively engaged in many different areas of interdisciplinary research: new hardware and cutting-edge software development; large scale data analysis and modern computational problems. In this way the research effort contributes to the development of a much-needed high tech workforce. <br/><br/>As one of the most fundamental quantities in physics, the proton charge radius new independent measurement will have far reaching effect in both atomic and nuclear physics. The currently developed experimental situation with this quantity limits the determination of the Rydberg constant, one of the basic and the most precisely known constant in nature up to now. The experimental results may be sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model. The projected 3% accuracy of the eta-meson lifetime measurement will potentially resolve the long-standing discrepancy between the Primakoff-type and electron-positron collider experiments. It will also improve the light quark mass ratio in a direct and model independent way."
0.38,"This CAREER award funds research at Syracuse University to support Advanced LIGO's quest to observe the gravitational wave universe. The research will include monitoring Advanced LIGO's data quality and developing hardware for upgrading the detectors. Specifically supported are i) The design and development of adaptive mode-matching for Advanced LIGO's output mode cleaner, enabling the use of non-classical squeezed-vacuum in the detector to improve the observational range. ii) A search for rare detector artifacts and low-level environmental correlations, prone to diminish the scientific return from Advanced LIGO.<br/><br/>Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts that violent cosmic events, such as for example colliding neutron stars, lead to tiny distortions of space-time here on earth, measurable as minuscule fluctuations in the distance between suspended optical mirrors. The NSF-funded Advanced LIGO project intends to precisely measure these so-called gravitational waves. Advanced LIGO's sensitivity is limited by the quantization of light, but can be improved by using an additional non-classical light source. Such light sources are however extremely sensitive to optical losses. This award supports the development of adaptive elements in the beam path to guarantee that all the light coming from the interferometer can be detected. Additionally, environmental disturbances have the potential to mimic the tiny distance fluctuations due to gravitational waves. This award supports monitoring Advanced LIGO's data for such disturbances. The first direct observation of gravitational waves will be a scientific break-through echoed in the news media, providing an outreach opportunity. The award supports workshops for high school teachers to bring the excitement of new scientific discoveries in this brand-new field of astronomy to high school class rooms."
0.3,"Working within a specific technical setting known as cavity quantum electrodynamics, this project pursues a program of experimental and theoretical research aimed at elucidating the essential physics of the 'mesoscopic' transition regime that lies between the deeply quantum-mechanical behavior of individual atoms and the classical behavior of large ensembles of atoms. Our findings are of basic interest both for fundamental physics and for future engineering applications in nanotechnology, which often seeks to exploit unique aspects of mesoscopic physics. Our approach is to conduct new experiments using several tens of atoms in a setting in which we have previously characterized the behavior of individual atoms and of ensembles of thousands of atoms. We will pursue rigorous quantitative comparisons between experimental data and computer simulations based on fundamental theoretical models.<br/><br/>The research crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines in science, engineering and mathematics. The graduate student working on the project receives unique interdisciplinary training and our research provides excellent source material for classroom teaching. The publications and research presentations based on this research can reach new audiences in engineering and applied mathematics who may commonly study some of the kinds of nonlinear dynamical behaviors that we are investigating, introducing them for the first time to novel quantum mechanical aspects that emerge in the mesoscopic, nanoscale regime."
0.318467,"Non-technical description:<br/>The Florida State University cryogenic Penning trap mass spectrometer is currently the world's most precise apparatus for measuring atomic masses (more colloquially, for ""weighing atoms""). The mass of an atom is a basic property and so atomic masses have many important applications in chemistry and physics. In particular, because of the equivalence of energy and mass (through ""E = mc2""), atomic mass differences determine the energy released in nuclear reactions. Although many atomic masses have already been precisely measured, there are several scientifically important applications where measurements at still higher precision are required. These applications include determining the mass of the neutrino, an extremely light and weakly interacting fundamental particle that pervades the universe. For years it was believed that the neutrino had no mass. We now know this not to be the case, and this new knowledge raises fundamental questions concerning the origin and structure of the universe. The project also provides training for student and post-doctoral researchers who are likely to make careers in academe, industry or national laboratories, hence contributing to the scientifically trained workforce.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>Three of the measurements we propose will provide atomic mass differences, or nuclear Q-values, that will be used to test systematics in other projects that seek to set upper limits on the mass of the electron anti-neutrino from low energy beta-decays. These are measurements of the 3T-3He mass difference for the ongoing, very-large-scale tritium beta-decay spectrometer KATRIN; and the mass differences 187Re-187Os and 163Ho-163Dy, for projects that will use micro-calorimeter beta-decay spectrometers. Other measurements on light ions will reduce the uncertainty of the atomic mass of the proton. Another mass difference, 35Cl-36Cl, will enable a check of precision gamma-ray metrology. Measurements of the atomic masses of 40,48Ca are also planned, to enable ongoing precision g-factor measurements of 40,48Ca19+ to test relativistic atomic theory for the g-factor of hydrogen-like ions and to probe the dependence on nuclear structure. The measurements will consist of ratios of cyclotron frequencies of pairs of ions in the 8.5 tesla magnetic field of the FSU Penning trap mass spectrometer. Unique features of this spectrometer include the ability to make and isolate, in the Penning trap, a single ion of nearly any element; phase-coherent detection of the axial motion of an ion, via image currents, using a high-Q super-conducting tuned-circuit coupled to a dc-SQUID; and measurement of the ion's cyclotron frequency by mapping evolved cyclotron phase onto axial motion using an rf pi-pulse at the cyclotron-to-axial coupling frequency. Cyclotron frequency noise due to variation in the magnetic field is reduced by trapping both ions in the pair simultaneously."
0.282655,"Usually, when particles or objects with different temperatures come into contact, they approach the same temperature as each other. After some time, there is no way to tell by looking at the particles or objects that they previously had different temperatures. That fact is such a fundamental part of our understanding of how the world works that it is called the ""Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics"". But it turns out that this is not always what happens. If all the particles interact in a certain special way, they retain a memory of earlier differences forever. That special way is called ""integrability"". It used to be considered a mathematical curiosity, something that couldn't happen in the real world. For classical particles, it was known in the 1960's that the Zeroth Law also does not hold for some systems even away from integrability. It was proven with equations and with computer simulations. But experiments had too many imperfections to demonstrate it in a lab. For particles whose motion is dominated by quantum mechanics, the answer of what happens away from integrability has not been understood with equations. Furthermore, even the best computers are not big or fast enough to give an answer. However, in the last few years, using very cold gases of atoms (a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero) confined by tubes of light so that they move only in one dimension, something very close to integrability has been demonstrated in the lab. These gases do not settle to a final temperature for as long as one can look at them, which is at least thousands of times longer than it takes similar gases to settle down in three dimensions. The question the group is now trying to answer is whether, with quantum mechanics, the Zeroth Law also doesn't hold when the integrability is not perfect. The answer to this question is important to the understanding of quantum mechanics, and it might make a big difference in the design of the growing number of devices (such as the most advanced prototype computers) that are based on collections of quantum particles. <br/><br/>The group is attacking this question experimentally by taking 1D gases of ultra-cold atoms out of equilibrium, and then studying the steady state to which they evolve. The 1D systems are formed by 2D optical lattices. They will lift integrability in several qualitatively different ways. They can makes the systems slightly and controllably 2D by allowing weak tunneling between tubes in one transverse direction. Doing the same thing with tunneling in two transverse directions will make the system slightly more 3D. Integrability will also be lifted by adding a very weak axial lattice to the 1D gas. The effects of each of these non-integrable terms will be measured by observing the evolution of their 1D momentum distributions. The goal is to determine the range of validity of quantum statistical mechanics, and perhaps to point the way to new methods of preserving quantum information."
0.55321,"High-energy gamma-rays are used to study the most extreme objects in the Universe, such as pulsars, black holes at the center of active galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts. Cosmic gamma-rays can also be signatures for new physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. Studies with very-high-energy gamma rays, above about 100 gigaelectron volt (GeV), require ground-based detectors with thousands of square meters of collection area. This research will use the VERITAS imaging Cherenkov telescope array in southern Arizona to study gamma-rays with energy greater than about 100 GeV. The sensitivity of VERITAS is more than an order of magnitude better than previous generation instruments operating in this energy range and has just been improved further by a substantial upgrade. <br/><br/>With this award the University of California - Santa Cruz group will use VERITAS to explore the extreme behavior of the two most powerful known classes of gamma-ray source: gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. The detail mechanisms of gamma-ray bursts and the role they play in other high-energy phenomena are still being explored. Learning whether they are capable of creating very-high-energy gamma-rays will constrain gamma-ray burst models and properties of the burst environment. Similarly, measurements of the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from active galactic nuclei probe properties of the jets, providing crucial information about the particles being accelerated and how the acceleration works. Data from across the electromagnetic spectrum will be gathered and used to assemble the most complete possible picture of very high-energy gamma-ray behavior. These data will also be used to study gamma-ray absorption by collisions with the extragalactic background light, a process that tests cosmological models of star formation and galaxy evolution.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Graduate and undergraduate students play an important part in this research effort. Research experiences will also be made available to aspiring science teachers in the Cal Teach program and in-service teachers through a new Lick Observatory Teachers Institute. The researchers interact with the California State University to foster undergraduate interest in research and graduate education. There is an important interplay between the VERITAS data and data from other wavelengths, particularly X-ray and lower energy gamma-ray data from satellite missions such as Swift and Fermi. More can be learned from both types of data used together than from either alone."
0.429998,"This project comprises an international collaboration to address precision measurements of fundamental interactions between antimatter and matter. Positrons (sometimes referred to as the anti-particle of the electron), impinging upon atoms and simple molecules, provide a unique opportunity to study the fundamental physics of these interactions. We measure the initial and final state momentum of each of the particles in a kinematically complete experiment. This provides the most stringent of criteria for comparing experiment with theory, and for studying the physics of highly correlated systems. In the case of simple molecules, it also enables us to extend the study of interactions to spatially-oriented molecules.<br/><br/>The understanding of these interactions is essential to precision modeling of positrons interacting with more complex molecules and may lead to diverse applications such as enhanced resolution for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans and the effects of beta decay of radio-isotopes on human tissue. It is a collaborative effort including scientists from the Australian Research Council's Center of Excellence for Antimatter-Matter Studies (CAMS) headquartered at the Australian National University and the Max-Planck-Institüt fur Kernphysik in Heidelberg. This research includes post-doctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students in an international ""one-world"" environment. As is often the case for these laboratory scale experiments, the students and post-docs are involved in all aspects of the research, from conception and development of the experimental apparatus through to the operation and diagnosis of the experiments, and analysis and publication of results."
0.015,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Brian Fields at the University of Illinois and Professor Lloyd Knox at the University of California Davis.<br/><br/>The theory of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest elements--hydrogen, helium, and lithium--in the first seconds of the big bang. BBN predictions for cosmic light-element abundances are in broad agreement with observations; this concordance is a major success of the hot big bang model. Moreover, BBN provides a measure of the ordinary matter (""baryon"") content of the universe, as well as total content in relativistic particles (""radiation"") in both visible and invisible form (e.g., neutrinos and any other forms of ""dark light""). In the past decade, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has emerged as a precise and independent measure of cosmic baryons. Comparing BBN and CMB baryon measures thus has provided a new fundamental test of the hot big bang cosmology, and reveal a ""lithium problem."" This BBN/CMB connection is now poised to open qualitatively new possibilities. Recent and upcoming measurements of the CMB for the first time will simultaneously probe not only cosmic baryons, but also cosmic radiation as well as the helium abundance itself. This will enable powerful new tests of cosmology: for the first time, the predictions of BBN can be tested entirely with very precise CMB data. Agreement would dramatically demonstrate the consistency of the standard cosmology, while any difference probes new physics. Professors Fields and Knox will both evaluate and interpret the BBN-CMB comparison, develop tools to efficiently and accurately compare BBN and CMB data. For the first time, a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach will be used to evaluate BBN uncertainties; this will allow a direct and consistent means of combining BBN predictions and CMB data and statistically characterizing the results. As part of this analysis, a new open-source BBN code will be produced, tested, and publicly released.<br/><br/>It is expected that this work will have substantial broader impacts. A publicly available open source BBN code will be released. Moreover, new and strong links will be forged among the CMB and early-universe particle astrophysics communities, and more widely among the particle astrophysics, cosmology, and astronomy communities. Graduate students, both in formal courses in research mentoring, will be trained to synthesize these approaches and to work in an interdisciplinary way. In addition, Profs. Fields will maintain vigorous, sustained outreach programs which include school visits and public lectures bringing this forefront science to a wider audience."
1.5,"This award funds the continued operations and further development of Einstein@Home and its software infrastructure, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). Einstein@Home is one of the largest and most powerful computers on the planet. It searches astrophysical data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars. Unlike a normal supercomputer, the computing power of Einstein@Home comes from ordinary home computers and laptops that have been ""signed up"" by about 300,000 members of the general public. When otherwise idle, these computers automatically download observational data over the Internet from Einstein@Home servers, search the data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars, and return the results of the analysis to the servers.<br/><br/>Neutron stars are exotic objects: they represent the most compact form that a star can take before it collapses into a black hole. Since they were discovered in 1967, about two thousand neutron stars have been found (including several discovered in 2010 and 2011 by Einstein@Home). Neutron star observations provide a unique view into the behavior of matter at extreme pressures and densities, and into the nature of gravitation when gravity is very strong. Under certain circumstances, neutron stars can be emitters of pulsing radio waves (pulsars). Einstein@home exploits the unique capabilities of the Arecibo Radio Observatory, the largest and most sensitive single-dish radio telescope in the world, to search for these signals. It is possible that neutron stars can also emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein in 1917 but have never been directly detected. Einstein@home can search the data from gravitational wave detectors such as those of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) for these signals. Einstein@home also supports the BOINC software infrastructure to benefit dozens of computationally intensive projects in other areas of science, that also exploit volunteer distributed computing. And it is a remarkable tool for scientific outreach: Einstein@Home allows hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens from around the world to participate in and make meaningful contribution to cutting-edge scientific research."
0.22,"Many nuclear processes in our universe occur under extreme conditions in supernovae and neutron stars. The properties of nuclei and nuclear matter under these conditions, which are difficult or impossible to reproduce in the laboratory, must necessarily be calculated theoretically. These data are needed to understand astrophysically important systems and processes such as neutron rich matter, neutron stars, supernovae, and r-process nucleosynthesis and neutrino scattering. The quantum many-particle methods developed within this project have broad applications across many areas of physics. These include the nuclear physics aspects directly relating to the project, cold atomic gas research, and electronic structure. Methods previously developed within this project have been applied in each of these areas. The project will train both undergraduate and graduate students, give them exposure at national and international conferences, and provide for dissemination of the results.<br/><br/>This project will continue work developing and using accurate techniques to calculate the properties of nuclei and nuclear matter using quantum Monte Carlo methods, i.e. stochastic sampling methods for the large number of quantum degrees of freedom. A primary aim is to develop auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo methods to sample both the space and spin-isospin degrees of freedom of protons and neutrons in nuclei with all important parts of the nuclear interaction. These include both the spin-orbit and three-body interactions. New wave functions which can be efficiently evaluated for nuclei are being developed, with the goal of obtaining accurate properties for medium to large and neutron rich nuclei. Superfluidity has major consequences in neutron star matter. The investigator and his students will use the same methods to study both the nuclear systems and the related phenomena in cold atomic gases. Many of the pairing and superfluid mechanisms important in nuclei and nuclear matter can be studied and verified in these systems where detailed experimental measurements can be made using table-top experimental setups."
0.47025,"Cosmic rays are produced and accelerated in the most violent environments of our Universe and can have energies that are orders of magnitude larger than the energies produced by the Earth's most powerful accelerators. Teraelectronvolt (TeV) gamma rays can be used to probe the possible sources of cosmic ray acceleration since they are produced in the interactions of cosmic rays with matter and radiation fields, and as neutral particles they can be traced back to their origin. The sensitivity and angular resolution of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes make these devices particularly well suited for point source and morphological studies, while the wide field of view and large duty cycle of extensive air shower arrays are advantageous for detecting diffuse gamma radiation from large areas in the sky. The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory is currently being constructed at the Sierra Negra Plateau, Mexico, and is expected to have a point source sensitivity that is improved by a factor of 10 to 15 over that of previous extensive air shower instruments. <br/><br/>The Michigan Technological University group will play a leading role in the collection and analysis of the scientific data of the experiment. Their research focus will be on the study of diffuse and extended very high-energy emission at large scales, which is now possible with unprecedented sensitivity due to the improved performance of HAWC. The group is also responsible for detector calibration and will therefore play a critical role in the HAWC construction and operation. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The participating students and post-doctoral scientist will receive scientific and educational training in the analysis of large data sets as well as the operation of a complex instrument within the context of a large international collaboration. The outreach component of this project is designed to generate greater community interest in physics through the installation of detector components in a local mine that is open to guided tours. This will expose teachers to modern experimental physics at the very-high energy frontier. The results of the outreach component of the proposed project will be disseminated by publications and conferences presentations."
0.3,"The generation and applications of entangled optical quantum states (i.e. the optical fields displaying correlations beyond those allowed by classical physics) is one of the recently recognized challenges in quantum optics. The intellectual merit of this project is to demonstrate a new approach for generation of a complete set of special fundamental non-classical states of an optical field, called Bell states, in which polarizations of two optical fields with close frequencies become quantum-mechanically entangled. Such Bell states are produced via nonlinear interaction of resonant light with Rubidium vapor. They form a natural basis for characterization and manipulation of quantum entanglement, and thus the findings will stimulate new developments in practical realizations of both quantum information protocols and in quantum-enhanced optical sensors. They will also be potentially transferrable to many other coherent systems (atomic/ionic, solid-state and photonic), with warm rubidium vapor serving as a prototype interaction.<br/><br/>This project offers a rich spectrum of educational opportunities by engaging graduate and undergraduate students in meaningful scientific research. Particular emphasis will be placed in attracting female and minority students, with the PI serving as a mentor and as a role model. Added educational benefits arise from adapting components of the experiments for advanced laboratory classes, and development of exciting demonstrations and public events for broader community."
0.351747,"In this project scientists will search for new, very weak forces between atoms. The current understanding of physics and cosmology allows for the possibility that in addition to the four known fundamental forces there may be additional weak forces due to the existence of new particles. To search for such forces the group supported by the present grant will perform very sensitive experiments on atoms using a variant of the technique that underlies MRI medical scanners (nuclear magnetic resonance). In the proposed experiments the group will orient the nuclear spins of atoms using lasers and watch how the spin orientation changes with time. They expect to improve the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude compared with earlier experiments. In addition to allowing the scientists to search for new forces between atoms, the proposed experiments will also have practical applications for very sensitive measurements of magnetic fields and for precision navigation.<br/><br/>The proposal describes a program of precision measurements based on high-sensitivity nuclear spin magnetometers. In one part of the program an existing alkali-metal noble-gas co-magnetometer will be used to set new limits on several hypothetical spin interactions. A possible interaction between spin and mass can be mediated by axions or other light pseudo-scalar particles. However, existing laboratory experiments searching for this effect have not yet reached a sensitivity that is competitive with astrophysical limits. One of the proposed experiments will improve these limits by more than 3 orders of magnitude and reach, for the first time, an unexplored range of parameter space. Another type of interaction that can be mediated by hypothetical light particles is a non-magnetic spin-spin interaction. Recent limits on such electron spin interactions can be improved by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude using already existing experimental apparatus. Another part of the program is focused on development of a new type of spin co-magnetometer, using two noble gas nuclear spin species and an alkali-metal readout with a Ramsey pulse interrogation. It is designed to have a higher accuracy as well as better precision compared with existing approaches. The sensitivity of the new co-magnetometer is already sufficient to realize a search for spin-gravity interaction with energy sensitivity at the Planck scale. The group's efforts will focus on the control of systematic effects in this experiment."
0.485291,"In this project the PI will develop detailed understanding of cellulose synthesis and the physical properties of cellulose microfibrils. Cellulose synthesis will be observed both in vitro and in vivo with single-molecule sensitive imaging techniques. In addition, the mechanics of individual cellulose microfibrils will be probed using optical imaging and manipulation, so as to elucidate their structure and dynamics. This work will provide the first direct observations of individual cellulose microfibril synthesis and flexibility. The specific objectives of this work are to (1) observe the detailed mechanics of cellulose-synthesis in vivo with single-molecule sensitive imaging; (2) measure the nanomechanics of individual microfibrils from an in vitro cellulose preparation; (3) observe cellulose synthesis in vitro, and measure microfibril dynamics during synthesis; and (4) develop a novel in vitro cellulose preparation based on Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant in which the genetics of cellulose synthesis is the best understood and most readily manipulated. The project will provide observations and measurements needed to create and validate physical models of a fundamental biological process and the material created by it. Similar models may be adapted to describe other naturally occurring fibers and the hierarchical structures built from them. The work will also provide new approaches for understanding the physical properties of nanoscopic fibers. These approaches will be useful in elucidating the mechanics and assembly of biological and manmade fibers that have defects or twists in their structure. Better understanding cellulose synthesis will also enhance plant science. A better understanding of cellulose synthesis will lead to better control and characterization of novel materials, such as nanocrystalline cellulose whiskers, that are recovered from bulk plant cellulose. Cellulose nanowhiskers are high-aspect ratio crystalline nanoparticles that are chemically stable and carbon neutral; their physical and chemical properties make them desirable in applications as diverse as electronics and drug delivery. Their material properties depend on their assembly in vivo, and yet the relationship between naturally occurring microfibrils and recovered nanocrystals has not been well established. The PI will introduce students at all levels and with many backgrounds to interdisciplinary research and single-molecule sensitive biophysical techniques. Recruitment and retention of the best students from the broadest possible pool of applicants will be facilitated by activities in conjunction with the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP) and with a local support group for women and minority members in physics.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Processes Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.099262,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.<br/><br/>This program, working with techniques on the leading edge of measurement technology, supports education and training of physics and electrical engineering undergraduate students in the PI's group, a diverse body including non-traditional and first-generation college students, as well as students from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The PI participates in the CU Denver's Mini-STEM school, the local Caf´e Scientifique, and a field trip program at a local K-8 magnet school.<br/><br/>This award will enable the PI and his students to fulfill specific responsibilities for both SuperCDMS Soudan and SuperCDMS SNOLAB projects, including operations support for SuperCDMS Soudan, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) characterization and testing for SNOLAB, and support during construction and initial commissioning.

0.043,"The main physics program supported by this award is to search for an electric dipole moment of the neutron, which if found would signal new physics beyond the physics of the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the existence and properties of the principal elementary constituents of known matter. The search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is one of the primary goals of physics in the 21st century. The experiment, called the neutron Electric Dipole Moment (nEDM), will be carried out at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, using instruments constructed and tested by a consortium of institutions. Construction of the detector and the data taking will take place in the next few years, providing first hand experience in cutting edge research for undergraduates at Valparaiso University.<br/><br/>Precision measurement of the properties of the neutron presents an opportunity to search for violations of fundamental symmetries and to make critical tests of the validity of the Standard Model. The Standard Model nearly prohibits the existence of a permanent electric dipole moment of the neutron, whereas extensions to the Standard Model predict an electric dipole moment of the neutron at varying strengths that are potentially attainable by this experiment. The discovery of a nEDM would imply a violation of time reversal invariance and a violation of charge-parity symmetry that, depending on its magnitude, has implications for the particle-antiparticle asymmetry in the universe. Measurements of the particle electric dipole moment provide some of the tightest constraints on extensions to the Standard Model. The experiment is designed to improve the sensitivity by a factor of 100 compared to previous experiments."
0.093266,"Non-technical description:<br/>Traditional chemical synthesis methods resemble cooking in the sense that the ingredients, mixing methods, temperature, and pressure all may be varied to produce a desired result. Despite control over all of these macroscopic variables there are some chemical processes that remain elusive. Since the invention of the laser in the 1960s, the field of coherent control has sought to use the laser to manipulate chemical dynamics by applying energy of suitable color and duration directly to individual molecules. In this sense, the laser can be thought of as a new type of reagent that drives a chemical reaction. While easily stated, this task has proved challenging. Molecules are complicated and dynamic, making it difficult to determine the correct laser characteristics to drive a particular process. A proven method for approaching this problem is to use experimental feedback to guide an adaptive search of the possible laser pulses. In a physics version of natural selection, laser pulses that provide a better outcome are given an increased chance to survive and have their characteristics contribute to the tailored pulse that ultimately produces the desired outcome. Such a method, however, is only as good as the feedback that drives it. The goal of these studies is to develop enhanced image-based feedback techniques that enable this adaptive approach to coherent control of chemical dynamics. <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The PI has recently developed the ability to use three-dimensional momentum imaging of the laser-molecule reaction products to define the control objective described in the non-technical description above. Using three-dimensional imaging to target a specific final state has led to better understanding of the mechanisms that undergird the laser-based control, especially in situations in which obtaining precise optical spectroscopic feedback is impractical. Increased mechanistic understanding can subsequently lead to better search parameterization, enhancing the adaptive control process. Current efforts are focused on applying image-based adaptive control to study and influence photoisomerization processes in small molecules such as ethylene. By studying photoionization, it is possible to probe how electronic excitation is rapidly converted to nuclear motion, an essential step in many ultrafast chemical processes. Ethylene is particularly interesting as a benchmark molecule for examining the role of conical intersections in these electronic to nuclear energy conversions. These studies will be advanced by using two-pulse experiments, which allow the separation of the ionization step from the subsequent evolution of the molecular ion, which the group hopes to control. Strong-field tunneling ionization of polyatomic molecules often involves multiple molecular orbitals, and studies of these relationships help link the image-based feedback to more specific target states, again with the objective of refining adaptive control methods. A goal of this project will be extending this work to explore the control of laser driven electron rescattering via feedback derived from angle resolved photoelectron distributions. Electron rescattering is an essential part of many ultrasfast laser-based processes, such as high-harmonic generation and the production of attosecond pulses, and therefore control of this sort has a number of potential applications. Finally, as an undergraduate institution, this project helps identify and develop talented students by immersing them in forefront research."
0.485,"An experiment will be pursued to search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron using cold cesium and rubidium atoms. The apparatus will be appropriately modified based on what has been learned over the last three years, and then EDM data collection will commence. The experiment uses atoms launched and loaded into a pair of parallel one-dimensional far-off-resonant optical lattice traps in a magnetically shielded region of space, laser-cooled and optically pumped. EDMs will be measured by observing coherent atom evolution in electric fields that are directed oppositely in the two traps. It is projected that the experiment will be sensitive to an EDM as small as 3x10-30 e-cm, which is a 300-fold improvement over the current limit.<br/><br/>A particle with a permanent EDM implies that both time-reversal invariance and parity invariance are violated. Both of these symmetries are in fact violated in the standard model of physics, which predicts very small, but non-zero EDMs for fundamental particles. Proposed extensions to the standard model tend to predict much larger EDMs, close to the current experimental upper limit. Continued non-observation of EDMs would rule out many possible extensions to the standard model. Conversely, should an EDM be observed, it would be the first experimental result of any kind that cannot be incorporated into the standard model of physics. If an EDM is found in an atom or molecule, the extraction of the fundamental physics will be far more reliable in the alkali atoms used in this experiment than in other more complicated atoms or molecules. This experiment addresses a question of fundamental importance to elementary particle physics. Such questions are normally addressed with high energy experiments, but in this case the precision tools of atomic physics can be applied to a much lower energy system, with a concomitant lower cost. Undergraduates and graduate students will be trained in the experimental research methods and develop skills preparing them for the nation's scientific work force."
0.439999,"A primary challenge of Nuclear Physics today is to understand the internal structure of hadrons and their complex interactions as they emerge from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of the strong force. The objective of this project is to explore the effects of chiral dynamics on hadron spectrum and structure. In particular, I will focus on electromagnetic polarizabilites, the masses of the lightest hadrons and the behavior of dense nuclear matter at high temperature. To investigate the properties of quarks in the energy region where hadrons are the dominant excitations, I will use a numerical approach, lattice QCD. <br/><br/>On the educational side, I am developing a seminar series, ""Modern Physics for Science Teachers"" and an undergraduate ""Computational Physics"" course. The seminars will be designed to help teachers connect the K-12 science curriculum to modern Physics research. The seminar series will constitute a valuable educational opportunity to science teachers and local K-12 students, in a area where the socio-economic and educational indicators are particularly low. <br/><br/>From a broader perspective, this project is part of an effort to understand the properties of visible matter in the universe. Complementing a rigorous experimental effort, my research explores the properties of nuclear particles as predicted by QCD. This will help answer questions relating to the composition of the early universe, exotic phases of matter inside neutron stars, charge distributions inside hadrons, origin of nuclear forces, etc. A significant part of my research involves developing numerical methods for QCD that exploit the tremendous computing power of graphics cards (GPUs). The expertise gained in using GPUs to solve nuclear physics problems will have direct applicability to all scientific and engineering fields that use finite-difference methods."
0.164227,"Electron-molecule interactions initiate and drive almost all chemical processes relevant to areas such as radiation damage, environmental chemistry, industrial plasmas used in the processing of materials for microelectronics and in modern lighting applications. Recently, there has also been an increasing awareness of the importance of electron-molecule interactions in biological systems. For example, low-energy electrons seem to have a significant effect in driving DNA strand breaks due to the passage of ionizing radiation through biological material. Given the prominence of electron-molecule interactions in many environments, it is imperative that we understand how electron interactions drive chemical processes, particularly those that lead to bond breaking in molecules, as the remaining fragments often serve as progenitors to chemical reactions and reaction chains. It is also important to understand how energy flows into and out of molecular systems. It is this energy flow that governs the dynamics of any electron-molecule interaction. Given advancements in modern computational resources, theoretical models are poised to address electron interactions with more complex systems, that is, those of more that two or three atoms. However it is difficult to assign any level of confidence to the outcomes of these models due to the sparsity of experimental measurements to benchmark against. This project will measure the bond breaking and molecular dynamics driven in electron interactions with several complex molecular systems, for example, hydrocarbons, alcohols, and simple organic molecules, to serve as experimental benchmarks to theoretical models.<br/><br/>The interactions of electrons with the complex systems above reveal information about the structure and dynamics when driven to non-equilibrium states. By exploring both high- and low-energy electron interactions, with these complex systems, we can ascertain a more in-depth understanding of the physics driving the correlated dynamics. This project brings the application of the momentum fragment imaging apparatus at Auburn University to the study of correlated dynamics in electron-molecule interactions. The momentum imaging technique measures the full three-dimensional momentum of dissociation fragment ions as a result of electron interaction. This allows for a complete study of dissociation dynamics as a function of both electron energy and interaction angle with respect to a bond axis. It also allows for a measurement of the energy partitioning between translational and internal ro-vibrational energy of dissociating fragment ions. At low electron energies, dissociative electron attachment (DEA) is dependent on the incidence angles of electrons, with respect to particular bond axes, and selectivity of bond cleavage can be realized. Recent results for DEA show that complex stretching and bending dynamics, beyond a quasi-diatomic representation, must be accounted for to adequately explain the dissociation dynamics of triatomic systems. This project will extend previous work by transitioning to more complex systems, as mentioned above, that have seen little or no previous experimental attention. At higher electron energies, the structure and dynamics of select diatomic and triatomic systems driven into highly excited and ionic states will also be probed via momentum imaging of ions formed by the dissociative ionization and ion-pair processes. At both the low- and high-energy regimes, these various processes exhibit constant energy transfer. It is this constant energy transfer that allows for the specific determination of states involved in these processes."
0.110191,"The goal of this project is to develop new computational methods to study the gravitational waves generated during the inspiral and merger of co-orbiting black holes. The approach uses techniques for solving Einstein's equations which have been recently developed in collaboration with computational mathematicians and thoroughly calibrated on test problems. They have been implemented as a community resource in the Einstein toolkit, which is used by the many research groups involved in black hole simulations. The techniques will be further developed to measure the loss of energy and angular momentum carried off by the gravitational waves. <br/><br/>Waves, such as water, sound and electromagnetic waves, are a prominent feature of physical systems. A revolutionary prediction of Einstein's gravitational theory is that accelerated bodies produce gravitational waves, analogous to the way electric charges produce electromagnetic waves. At present, gravitational waves have only been detected indirectly by the way they deplete energy from two co-orbiting pulsars. A Laser Interferometric Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO) has been constructed that is expected to open up a new form of astronomy by direct detection of these waves. The most powerful source of gravitational waves is the inspiral and merger of two co-orbiting black holes. Computer simulations provide the theoretical details necessary for LIGO to tune in on the gravitational signal and monitor the dynamics of the merger."
0.87,"In this project the investigators will explore phenomena that span the tree of life: from metabolism in bacteria, through the determination of cell fate in embryonic development, to coding and computation of sensory information in the brain. They have identified broad theoretical problems which cut across the traditional biological divisions of organism and system: Do living organisms operate near the limits set by the laws of physics as they gather and process information? Can the detailed microscopic model of an organism, its wiring diagram be understood from the finite set of observations that can be made on how it behaves? How do organisms set the parameters that govern their function (i.e. how do they learn from experience)? These questions will be given a mathematical form, which will guide a search for answers in terms of general principles, in the tradition of physics, that will apply across disparate biological domains. The participants in the project will assemble into subgroups to attack instances of these problems. The individual projects will have unusual scope: as an example, the question whether the complex statistics of biological behavior can be captured in a learnable mathematical model will be asked in very similar terms both of spiking retinal neurons, and of the antibody sequence repertoire of individual zebrafish. These questions will be answered in the light of accurate data and the work will involve a close partnership with many experimental groups in fields ranging from bacteriology to human perceptual psychology. The product of these interactions will be the design of novel experiments and the creation of novel data analysis methods in order to address clearly formulated mathematical questions of broad significance. An important component of this project is the training of a new generation of physicists for whom the development of a theoretical understanding of biological systems is a central part of their discipline. The graduate students and postdoctoral scholars who pass through the group will learn by example how to pursue that goal in a way consistent with the intellectual rigor and traditions of physics."
0.12,"This award funds the research of Associate Professor John T. Giblin, Jr. at Kenyon College.<br/><br/>Recent observational and experimental results have shed new light on the nature of high-energy particle physics and models of the early Universe. It is clearer now than ever that the Universe is the only laboratory in which we can study fundamental physics at energies above those achievable in accelerators. The theories that describe physics at these energies are highly non-linear, complex dynamical systems. Professor Giblin's research will use employ cutting-edge numerical techniques as well as analytic methods to predict the observational consequences of many models of high-energy physics. These results will help understand how current and future observations can constrain models of beyond-the-standard model physics. This research also addresses the pressing need to cultivate interest in science among young students and college undergraduates. Approximately two hundred fifty middle school students will be brought to Kenyon College for a ""Science Saturday"" program that will engage them with hands on science activities. Students will also get to work with scientists throughout the day offering them a positive, interactive model of scientific inquiry. This funding will also support undergraduate research and collaboration. Meaningful undergraduate research is a critical component of supporting and cultivating the next generation of young scientists.<br/><br/>The numerical methods studied under this award will allow for the study of non-linear and derivatively coupled field theories as they relate to Inflation, Gauge theories and Gravitation. The software developed here, Grid and Bubble Evolver (GABE), will discover how abelian and non-abelian gauge fields modify inflation and post-inflationary process and probe the effects of field theories with non-minimal kinetic terms. Further, it will be used to predict observable signatures, primordial power spectra and gravitational radiation, of these models. These studies will help to understand whether or not realistic models of inflation are viable and consistent with observations, and explore the non-minimal nature of particles as a possible explanation of the nature of Dark Energy. In addition, this award will support investigations of nonlinear gravitational interactions during phase transitions in the post-inflationary epoch and relevant numerical. As we prepare for the next generation of gravitational wave observatories, precise predictions of gravitational wave spectra could have drastic consequences on the design and cost of these experiments."
0.219393,"The study of nuclear interactions and properties from the underlying theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) represents a central goal in nuclear physics research. At low energies, however, QCD becomes non-linear and strongly interacting, eluding first-principle pencil-and-paper calculations of nuclear properties. An important aspect of nuclear physics at low energy is the physics associated with weakly bound systems. Some properties of such systems are universally shared across atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The effective field theory (EFT) formulation allows for systematic calculations of nuclear properties that are deeply rooted in QCD. EFT allows reliable error estimates in calculations that are otherwise difficult to estimate in phenomenological approaches. In the supported research work, EFT for few-body systems involving electromagnetic radiation would be constructed. Key reactions involving light nuclei that are relevant in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and stellar burning would be studied. Some of these reactions play an important role in interpreting experimental results probing physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The proposed work would also introduce new model-independent tools with reliable error estimates to study halo nuclei. These nuclei are described as a tightly bound core with usually one or two valence neutrons forming a halo. This research ties in with planned major U.S. investment in rare isotope beam experiments. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of the research include training of physics graduate students in numerical and analytical work for an academic or industry career benefiting society. Results from this research work would be incorporated in a graduate course. Atomic physics research would also be affected by this study of weakly bound few-body systems due to the universality described above. Atomic systems with large scattering lengths form an active field of theoretical and experimental research."

Advanced LIGO is expected to open a new exciting window on the Universe, heralding the beginning of gravitational-wave astronomy as a revolutionary, new observational field. This award provides support for the LIGO group at the University of Mississippi. Mississippi researchers will contribute to the Advanced LIGO endeavor in the areas of detector characterization, data analysis and public outreach.

This project will increase training and mentoring opportunities for Mississippi students and young researchers, as well as expand public outreach opportunities in the region. In addition to bringing the excitement of science to the general public, the outreach activities will promote diversity and engagement of students from traditionally underrepresented populations through a program of visits of women and minority speakers to Mississippi's educational institutions."
0.24,"Gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that carry information about the changing gravitational fields of distant astrophysical objects. Gravitational waves will be a radically new tool for exploring the universe. This award supports the effort to detect gravitational waves from merging neutron stars and black holes with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Black holes and neutron stars are nature's most compact objects and their collisions are a potentially transformative laboratory for fundamental physics and astrophysics. Gravitational-wave physics offers exciting opportunities to inspire and educate students of all ages, strengthening both the diversity and competitiveness of students and improving the scientific literacy of the general public.

The primary goal of this project is to detect gravitational waves and to extract the astrophysics encoded in LIGO's signals. Engineering and science runs during the first two years of this proposal will allow the LSC to understand both the Advanced LIGO detectors and the search pipelines in an observational mode. Science runs during the second and third years of this proposal will produce astrophysical results. The first direct detection of gravitational waves could be made during the period of this award."
0.328284,"This project is a collaborative effort between Bryn Mawr College and Ursinus College in which we are exploring the coherent control of interactions among ultracold Rydberg atoms with a combination of experimental and computational efforts. When atoms in an ultracold gas are excited to weakly bound Rydberg states, they can exchange energy through a dipole-dipole interaction. In many cases this energy exchange proceeds quickly enough that the atoms are essentially stationary, resembling an amorphous solid. This leads to complicated many-body processes during the energy exchange that can be manipulated with a variety of techniques. We are focusing our efforts on coherently controlling the dipole-dipole energy exchange among atoms by exciting coherent superpositions of initial states, arranging the Rydberg atoms in particular spatial patterns, and manipulating the geometry and timing of the electric field used to tune this energy exchange into resonance. These experiments are helping to expand the toolkit for controlling atomic interactions. We are modeling the experiments using parallel computing resources in order to contribute to the understanding of the complex many-body interactions.<br/><br/>Cold Rydberg atoms provide a rich system in which to explore a range of fundamental physics that is of interest to a broad segment of the community. The precision with which both the internal structure of each atom and the spatial arrangement of these atoms can be controlled will allow us to study many-body and correlation effects for a range of configurations. The interest in ultracold gases coupled by long range dipole-dipole interactions has grown rapidly in recent years and is being explored using atoms with large magnetic spins and heteronuclear molecules as well as Rydberg atoms.<br/><br/>This project will engage undergraduates, with particular attention to attracting female students, at both Bryn Mawr and Ursinus in computational and experimental research on ultracold Rydberg atoms. Bryn Mawr and Ursinus are small, national liberal arts colleges located in close proximity in southeastern Pennsylvania. Bryn Mawr awards a small number of PhDs and this project will also support a graduate student. The collaborative nature of the project will broaden opportunities for students at both institutions."

These researchers also intend to apply these advances to the physics of the Universe, to quantum black holes, to particle physics beyond the Standard Model, and to condensed-matter physics. An important aspect of this research program concerns the precise relations between quantum gauge field theories and gravitational theories, known as gauge/gravity dualities. Also included in these studies are gravitational theories that contain fields of arbitrarily high spin. <br/><br/>This research project is also envisioned to have an essential educational and mentoring component: preparing post-docs, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates for successful research careers.

0.4,"The goal of this CAREER project from Professor Liam McAllister at Cornell University is to provide compelling theoretical models of the early universe -- in particular, models of inflation in string theory -- and to use these ideas to interpret the coming generation of cosmological observations. Cosmology has made spectacular strides in the last decade, emerging as a precise experimental science with profound connections to fundamental physics. Recent observations are remarkably consistent with the predictions of inflation, which describes explosive expansion before the hot Big Bang. Inflation builds on quantum field theory and general relativity, and is sensitive to the interplay between them, i.e. to the ultraviolet completion of gravity. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of inflation requires a theory of quantum gravity, such as string theory. Moreover, by probing inflation through cosmological observations, one can examine physics at the highest energy scales, and shed light on the physical laws that governed the beginning of our universe.<br/><br/>This activity is also envisioned to have significant Broader Impacts. Specifically, the PI plans to communicate some of the compelling, urgent problems at the core of modern physics to high-school students and science teachers in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in New York City. To achieve this, the PI will begin by lecturing to an audience of public school teachers from New York City; then hold a professional development workshop for interested teachers, focusing on key questions of modern physics outside the standard curriculum; and finally, visit participating teachers' classrooms. By forming and maintaining long-term relationships with teachers, the PI will be able to assess the results on an ongoing basis and recalibrate the presentations as needed. The PI will have the assistance of a dedicated Cornell outreach coordinator for all of these activities."
0.320999,"Research in string theory in the past three decades has led to exciting new insights in physics and mathematics. Considering string propagation in nontrivial backgrounds produces physical interpretations for mathematical structures in spacetime. The interplay between mathematical and physical intuitions and techniques has enriched both fields. A notable example of this is the discovery and the many applications of mirror symmetry. The research described here will build on these results and on recent progress in both fields to pursue these studies in new regimes. One aim is to improve our understanding of the geometry and physics of heterotic string compactifications using a variety of approaches. These models can describe universes similar to ours with such features as nonabelian gauge symmetry and chiral matter content. In addition an investigation of extremal transitions in M-theory compactifications using insights from geometry and field theory will be carried out to learn about the possible dynamics. This work is expected to lead to a better understanding of the physics of string theory, as well as to insight into the mathematics of CalabiYau spaces.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This work will be done in collaboration with physicists and mathematicians around the world, enhancing interdisciplinary cooperation. Experience shows that such collaborations in this field have been productive , as new physics insights and new results in pure mathematics go hand-in-hand. The PI will also train graduate students and involve undergraduate students in the research. He will also enhance his program of outreach activities. This includes collaborations with local public schools to enhance science teaching and generate enthusiasm for science in young people by visits to the classroom by the PI and/or by students trained by the PI to present specific curriculum materials developed in concert with the schools.

0.45,"This work aims to coherently couple light to a macroscopic mechanical oscillator via a radiation pressure force and to explore quantum entanglement between light and the mechanical oscillator in such an optomechanical system. Specific objectives of the project include preparing a macroscopic mechanical oscillator near its motional ground state and entangling the mechanical oscillator with light through a two-mode-squeezing optomechanical process. The experimental effort will focus on the study of transient, instead of steady-state, optomechanical interactions, which should enable entanglement operations in a timescale short compared with the mechanical decoherence time. The project will also develop optomechanical resonators that can feature high mechanical quality factor, ultrahigh optical finesse, as well as strong optomechanical coupling. A particular emphasis is to realize a well-isolated optomechanical system for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena in an otherwise classical mechanical system. This work makes contributions to education and human resource by providing excellent training to graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance.<br/><br/>Quantum mechanics, as a fundamental theory, describes the microscopic world of electrons, atoms and molecules and predicts strange or weird behaviors, such as quantum superposition and quantum entanglement. Exquisite control of these quantum behaviors has now been achieved in a variety of microscopic systems. Applying quantum mechanics to otherwise classical objects or systems in the macroscopic world, however, encounters both conceptual and technical issues. The optomechanical system developed in this project provides us a specific experimental platform for investigating quantum behaviors in a macroscopic mechanical system. In such a system, one can control the mechanical motion down to the quantum regime by exploiting the interaction between light and the mechanical motion. Extending the study and control of quantum behaviors to this macroscopic system can potentially shed light on the boundary between the quantum and classical worlds and can also have significant impact on the development of quantum technologies such as such as quantum information processing and precision or ultra-sensitive measurements."
0.195,"The LIGO gravitational wave detectors are currently undergoing a major upgrade, with the goal of improving the broadband sensitivity by an order of magnitude. The scientific capabilities of the instruments can be further enhanced by improving the signal processing techniques used to tease faint gravitational wave signals out of the instrument noise. The research described in this proposal seeks to develop tools that will enhance our ability to detect and characterize transient gravitational wave signals. The initial searches for gravitational waves have taught us that non-Gaussian features in the data, such as noise transients or ""glitches"", impair our ability to detect weak signals. Experience with blind signal injections has taught us the importance of signal characterization and parameter estimation in assessing putative detections. Our goal is to develop and implement powerful new techniques that can help separate gravitational wave signals from instrument artifacts. This will be done in the framework of the BayesWave algorithm that was developed under a predecessor award. BayesWave provides a natural framework to develop targeted searches by incorporating prior knowledge about the signals and glitches. Multi-variate classifiers and cluster analysis tools will be used to identify glitch families based on the characterizations provided by the BayesWave analysis. These will aid in real-time detector studies and noise mitigation efforts. In the event of a detection, the signal characterization capability will help identify the type of astrophysical system that could have produced the observed waveform. These studies will become possible in near real-time using a new technique that speeds up the computation of the model likelihood by orders of magnitude. The detection of gravitational waves will allow a host of science questions to be addressed. Foremost among these will be whether the signals detected conform to the predictions of Einstein's theory of general relativity. The final component of this proposal deals with developing robust and generic techniques for identifying departures from general relativity using LIGO/Virgo data.<br/><br/>The LIGO project presents young researchers and students with a wonderful opportunity to participate in the birth of a new observation science that is poised to make discoveries that will revolutionize astronomy and deliver unique insights into some of the Universe's most exotic phenomena. The research program outlined in this proposal offers tremendous opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students: the blend of creative activities associated with the development of sophisticated and innovative data analysis techniques, combined with hands on exposure to running existing search pipelines and working with production level computer code will provide excellent training for the next generation of gravitational wave astronomers. These skills are transferable and highly sought after in other fields: recent graduates from the Montana State gravitational wave astronomy group have found employment as national security intelligence analysts and in the medical research field of bioinformatics. Our group has been very active in bringing gravitational wave science to the public through talks, a school lecture program, and the production of a documentary.

0.6,"This CAREER award will enable the PI, Patricia Vahle, Assistant Professor of Physics at the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, to participate in the commissioning and operation of the NOvA Integration Prototype Near Detector (IPND). This CAREER program describes a plan of research with realistic potential for broader impact which takes good advantage of the PI's experience and expertise and positions the PI to make a significant contribution to NOvA in the areas of calibration and data analysis, areas which are obviously important too for future particle physics experiments. The IPND will be installed on the surface at Fermilab starting in the summer of 2010, providing a test bed for the NOvA detector design and systems integration. After a year of running on the surface, the detector will be disassembled and reinstalled underground, becoming the NOvA near detector. The neutrino data collected with the detector allow for the development of detector calibration techniques, signal versus background separation algorithms, and tests of the simulation of nuclear hadronization and reinteraction processes, all of which are crucial to the success of the experiment. Within the broader impact, the project will be a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc. The IPND program offers ample short term hardware and analysis projects, ideally suited to an undergraduate summer research experience. To ensure a vibrant scientific program into the future, one needs to capture the imagination of students well before they enter college. To that end, Vahle proposes providing local high school and middle school teachers the opportunity to participate in summer research projects on site at Fermilab. In the summers she is in Williamsburg, she would exploit the relationship developed between the W&M neutrino group and the local school teachers by employing a teacher for several weeks over the summer to help develop, then implement, science events."
0.437938,"This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the LIGO Research Support program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and Geophysics program in the Division of Earth Sciences in the Directorate of Geosciences. Seismometer arrays are commonly used in geophysics, seismology, and engineering to study the propagation of seismic waves, detect and study their sources, and assess properties of the Earth's interior at various depths. The vast majority of seismometer arrays to date have been surface-based due to the ease of installation. This project will build and operate a dense, underground, three-dimensional array of 13 high-sensitivity broadband seismometers. The array will be located at the Homestake mine, SD, whose accessible depth of 4850 feet and vast horizontal span allow probing a 1-mile underground cube. Bringing together the existing techniques in gravitational physics and geophysics for analysis of transient and stochastic wave signals, this project is expected to give rise to qualitatively new seismic data analysis techniques. Importantly, results of these studies will also have a profound impact on the design of future underground experiments in gravitational physics, such as probes of the Equivalence Principle of Einstein's theory of relativity. Future underground gravitational-wave detectors that will observe otherwise inaccessible signatures of various astrophysical phenomena and of the Big Bang will also be designed based on the seismic noise studies conducted within this project.<br/><br/>This project will enable interactions between the geophysics and gravitational physics communities that would be of substantial mutual benefit. Since the future of gravity experiments is arguably underground, it is critical for the gravitational physics community to draw from the large body of knowledge in geophysics on seismic noise and seismic wave propagation. By allowing a team of physicists and geophysicists to work together on the analysis of this unique high-quality data in a mutually interesting environment, this project will lead to breakthroughs in seismic noise tomography. Such breakthroughs will have a broad range of applications and societal implications, ranging from nondestructive material testing to medical diagnosis, geophysical prospecting (detecting mineral deposits and oil), and homeland security (detecting underground cavities). The project will also educate several graduate and undergraduate students, exposing them to the frontiers of research at the intersection of the fields of geophysics and gravitational physics."

While the Fermilab Tevatron has ceased operations, nevertheless significant data remains to be analyzed from the experiments. The SUNY at Buffalo group continues to play an important role in the analysis of data from the D0 experiment.<br/><br/>The proposed program concentrates on finding answers to fundamental questions about the Electroweak symmetry breaking and on searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). One aspect of the research is to search directly for Higgs particles at the CMS and D0 experiments, and to search for evidence of new heavy vector bosons at CMS. Another aspect involves the study of SM processes such as the associated production of vector bosons with bottom and charm quarks which constitute backgrounds to Higgs boson searches in various decay channels. The discovery of the Higgs boson or a new heavy vector boson would be a major breakthrough in our understanding of fundamental properties of matter, while any deviation from the SM prediction could manifest presence of New Physics. <br/><br/>The SUNY at Buffalo group is also making important technical contributions to the CMS Experiment, particularly the operations and upgrade of the Forward Pixel Detector project.

When otherwise idle, these computers automatically download observational data over the Internet from Einstein@Home servers, search the data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars, and return the results of the analysis to the servers.<br/><br/>Neutron stars are exotic objects: they represent the most compact form that a star can take before it collapses into a black hole. Since they were discovered in 1967, about two thousand neutron stars have been found (including several discovered in 2010 and 2011 by Einstein@Home). Neutron star observations provide a unique view into the behavior of matter at extreme pressures and densities, and into the nature of gravitation when gravity is very strong. Under certain circumstances, neutron stars can be emitters of pulsing radio waves (pulsars). Einstein@home exploits the unique capabilities of the Arecibo Radio Observatory, the largest and most sensitive single-dish radio telescope in the world, to search for these signals. It is possible that neutron stars can also emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein in 1917 but have never been directly detected. Einstein@home can search the data from gravitational wave detectors such as those of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) for these signals. Einstein@home also supports the BOINC software infrastructure to benefit dozens of computationally intensive projects in other areas of science, that also exploit volunteer distributed computing. And it is a remarkable tool for scientific outreach: Einstein@Home allows hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens from around the world to participate in and make meaningful contribution to cutting-edge scientific research."
0.048152,"This award partially supports the Santa Fe Alliance For Science (SFAFS), an organization that utilizes the very large population of STEM professionals in New Mexico (third per capita among all states) to help improve K-14 math and science education in the Santa Fe area, and to raise the profile of math and science. SFAFS volunteers have created a program that brings greatly enriched math and science content to a large number of students, parents and teachers in Santa Fe. In 2013-14, these activities, involving over 5,000 student interactions, utilized over 4,300 volunteer hours. This project will solidify the very substantial gains that have been made and to add improvements that will make the program even stronger.<br/><br/>The research questions underlying this work include (1) How this resource of STEM professionals can be utilized to make effective change happen; (2) How this group of highly-trained math and science experts can be molded into an effective pedagogical entity; (3) How existing educational modalities can be modified, or reshaped, to take advantage of this talent pool; (4) How these specially skilled individuals can help create greater student and public interest in the beauty, power and value of math and science, and bring these ideas to all segments of the community; and (5) How the social and political issues that will certainly arise can be dealt with most effectively."
0.163402,"This research focuses on two areas: (i) the description of hadron properties in terms of their constituent quarks and gluons, and (ii) the production of strangeness and charm in antiproton-proton interactions. (i) A hybrid approach will be used to describe hadron properties in terms of both perturbative and non-perturbative processes. A statistical model will represent perturbative degrees of freedom, and a meson cloud model will represent the nonperturbative fluctuation of baryons into meson-baryon states. A study of the pion-nucleon form factor will reduce the model-dependence of pion cloud contributions to this and other hadron structure calculations. This project will address one of the outstanding challenges to theory posed by recent experiment, the momentum-dependence of light quark distributions in the proton sea, and determine the parton contributions to strangeness and spin in the proton. Predictions will be made for experiments running at Fermilab and planned at JPARC. (ii) The creation of antihyperon-hyperon pairs in antiproton-proton annihilations tests theoretical models for the description of strangeness and charm production. Quark model calculations and reaction matrix analyses of these reactions will be made and compared to meson-exchange and constituent quark models, and to recent spin transfer measurement results from CERN, which disagree with all theoretical calculations. Cross sections and spin observables will be calculated for the experiments planned by the PANDA collaboration at FAIR, which will extend the CERN measurements to higher energies and to the production of charmed hyperons. <br/><br/>Nucleons (protons and neutrons) and other hadrons are particles composed of quarks, gluons, and a fluctuating sea of quark-antiquark pairs. In this research we study the fundamental questions of how the properties of a particle are determined by the properties of its constituents, and how those constituents affect the ways in which particles interact with one another. An example of this type of question is proton spin. The proton spin is 1/2, but it consists of many quarks (spin 1/2) and gluons (spin 1). How do all these spins add up to give us a spin-1/2 proton? This work will be carried out with undergraduate research assistants from Seattle University. Their research experience will provide an integration of classroom learning and the excitement of contemporary research. Students will receive training in research methods and scientific communication. They will work in teams, mentor younger students and present their work in papers, posters and talks at meetings of professional societies. They will also share their work with the local campus community in seminars and events sponsored by Seattle University student research organizations."
0.051199,"This project continues the development and use of advanced software algorithms to search for gravitational waves - ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein's theory of gravity - in data from the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). These are a predicted signature of some of the most energetic events in the universe, including neutron stars and black holes that orbit one another and spiral inwards and collide. The detection of gravitational waves from such collisions will allow a direct confirmation of this prediction of Einstein's theory, and will also allow measurement of the properties of the neutron stars or black holes whose collision generated the waves. Such properties are often difficult to measure indirectly through present observations with telescopes and satellites. The broader impacts of this proposal will include the training of undergraduate students in the nascent field of gravitational wave astronomy, and dissemination of the first results of that field to the broader public through short videos and public talks.<br/><br/>The specific problem this proposal will address is the tuning and deployment of an offline, matched-filter search for compact binary coalescing sources for non-spinning and aligned-spin systems, and the development and testing of a search for precessing spin systems. This will be done using the PyCBC pipeline toolkit of which the PI is a developer, and the tuning studies and investigation of precessing searches will each test the detection sensitivity of their respective searches on Mock Data Challenge (MDC) data collected from earlier LIGO running and engineering runs. These detection sensitivity studies will in turn be used to decide on tuning choices, and for precessing searches, whether overall detection efficiency is improved by searching over a precessing waveform template parameter space. Broader impacts will be achieved by involving undergraduates in this research both locally at ACU, and by traveling to the Albert Einstein Institute in Hannover, Germany. Additionally, public outreach will continue the sequence of short, educational videos that the PI and his students have already made on relativity."
0.48,"The research goals of the project are focused on understanding the strong-field regime of Einstein's theory of general relativity. This encompasses both astrophysical and theoretical aspects of general relativity. On the astrophysical side, the main effort is an ongoing study of sources of gravitational waves in our universe, in particular binary black hole, black hole-neutron star and binary neutron star collisions. When neutron stars are involved in the collision, further questions involving potentially observable electromagnetic counterpart emission and production of r-process elements in ejected material will be pursued. The theoretical work includes studies of gravitational collapse and corresponding critical phenomena, the ultrarelativistic regime of particle collisions where gravity dominates the interaction, and the nature of gravity in higher dimensional spacetimes. Of particular interest for the latter subject are asymptotically Anti de-Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, where the gravitational dynamics can be related to the physics of strongly coupled conformal field theories (CFTs) via the AdS/CFT correspondence of string theory.<br/><br/>This research will contribute crucial information to our understanding of sources of gravitational waves in the universe and so form an integral part of the burgeoning field of gravitational wave astronomy. It will further provide a deeper understanding of the dynamical strong-field regime of general relativity, and help expand our knowledge of the interrelations between general relativity, high energy physics, and quantum gravity. The pursuit of these projects will involve graduate students, undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows. They will thus be trained to do leading scientific research, become knowledgeable in corresponding areas of physics, and adept in high-performance computing and numerical methods. These skills are invaluable to many professions, and would thus also benefit and further the development of those students and postdocs that subsequently wish to pursue careers outside academia."
0.1,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Silviu Pufu at Princeton University. <br/><br/>Professor Pufu's research addresses, from different points of view, how the behavior of physical systems changes between short and long distance scales. This research is focused on physical systems that are effectively two-dimensional, such as layered materials that have weak interactions between the layers and very strong interactions within each layer. Such two-dimensional systems are interesting partly because they might realize new strongly-interacting phases of matter, and partly because they represent toy models for phenomena that occur in our three-dimensional world and are hard to understand. Professor Pufu will develop theoretical tools for understanding how, in these two-dimensional systems, the short-distance physics affects and constrains the long-distance physics. These tools are partly based on ideas from string theory, whereby one can describe strongly-interacting two-dimensional systems by gravity in three spatial dimensions.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project's goals are to deepen our understanding of the renormalization group by investigating constraints on possible renormalization group flows; to study properties of three-dimensional quantum field theories with holographic duals; and to learn about monopole operators in simple non-supersymmetric conformal field theories. This research aims not only to cement our understanding of quantum field theory and of the renormalization group, but also to gain insight into phenomena like confinement in three space-time dimensions that are hard to understand in the theory of strong interactions in four space-time dimensions. In addition, studying strongly-interacting theories with holographic duals can teach us, indirectly, important lessons about quantum gravity. The proposed research provides a bridge between the high energy and condensed matter communities, because learning about confinement and monopole operators is very important in understanding which types of consistent theories can describe, at least in principle, the low-energy physics of various lattice systems. This project has a significant educational and mentoring component, whereby it can be used to train post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and advanced undergraduate students and prepare them for successful scientific careers. Pufu will be involved in advising science-inclined beginning undergraduates on matters that would prepare them for careers in scientific research."
0.332653,"This project studies an aspect of quantum physics, which is the study of the natural world at its most fundamental level. Experiments with elementary objects such as photons (constituents of light) or electrons (constituents of atoms) has led over the decades to many new technologies, including computers and lasers. The next generation of technology (called quantum technology), might create the means for ensuring perfect security of information on the internet, as well as computers that can solve problems unsolvable using today's hardware. Light, as a carrier of information, plays important roles in such technologies, so the ability to control light more and more finely is crucial for future success. The present study addresses the so-called nonlinear interactions of light that occurs in some substances or materials. For example, when very intense light of a certain color travels through a long solid-glass fiber, new colors can be created by nonlinear interactions. Such color-changing interactions have many uses, both in scientific research and in technological applications. A problem exists though, called ""Raman scattering,"" which leads to the production of many unwanted colors in addition to those desired. In this type of scattering, energy is deposited in the vibrations of molecules making up the medium. These unwanted, randomly produced colors can degrade the purity of the light, so a means to avoid their production is an important goal. The present study is developing such a means by replacing solid-glass fibers with hollow glass fibers filled with xenon gas at extremely high pressure. Because xenon is a ""noble gas"" it does not form molecules, and so the Raman light scattering mechanism is absent. Optical physics and light-based information science (photonics) offer excellent opportunities to integrate research with science education.<br/><br/>From a more technical perspective, the project addresses the need in quantum optics research for attaining ideal interactions for generating and manipulating quantum-mechanical states of light, including single photons, entangled photons, squeezed states, and entangled states, as well as for performing quantum gate operations and implementing quantum communication methods. Toward these goals, this experimental project studies optical parametric processes using high-density atomic xenon gas confined in hollow-core photonic-crystal fibers (HC-PCF). Such a medium will open up the study of fundamental quantum optical processes without the often-deleterious presence of Raman scattering. Elimination of Raman scattering removes spontaneous photon emission background signals in single-photon sources, and removes Raman-induced frequency shifting in optical soliton propagation, which limits the degree of quantum noise squeezing that can be achieved. It also decreases pump-laser degradation. Such a system could lead to well-controlled nonlinear optical processes for quantum information schemes. Developing the means to manipulate and control the states of quantum systems is of broad interest in science and in quantum information technology, metrology, quantum chemistry, nano-mechanics, etc. The topic brings together quantum opticians with optical device scientists and material scientists."
0.3,"The goal of this award is to construct an arbitrary optical waveform generator that utilizes coherent vibrations and rotations in molecules to produce a broad Raman spectrum of light. This will generate several millions of wavelengths simultaneously, covering the spectral region from infrared, visible to the ultraviolet. Furthermore, the spectrum will be in the continuous wave domain. The intellectual merit of this work is, through the understanding of the complex, nonlinear interactions in the molecular Raman process, to transform the concept into a working device, capable of delivering new research discoveries. <br/><br/>Constructing such a light source has been one of the biggest challenges in optical science since the invention of the laser in 1960. Once constructed, such a device will have important applications in a broad range of areas and will have the potential for a large impact on society: (1) By combining all of the different-colored lasers, flashes of light whose duration is shorter than a femtosecond (a billionth of a millionth of a second) can be created. Such short pulses are necessary to probe and to understand the ultrafast electronic processes that occur on these time scales. With this new understanding, new ultrafast electronic devices may be constructed. (2) By using all these lasers with different colors, a large number of atomic and molecular species can be investigated simultaneously. Such a capability is necessary to better understand the structures of complex molecules, including biological molecules such as proteins. 3) A device that produces millions of lasers could be used to control certain chemical reactions with unprecedented precision. As a result, specific chemical products (such as pharmaceutical drugs) may be synthesized much more efficiently. The research provides human resources training. Graduate students and undergraduate students participate in research that is at the forefront of optical physics and laser sciences. They will acquire skills that are critical for the future high technology workforce."
0.15,"The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. The Syracuse group will support the LIGO Scientific Collaboration's search for gravitational wave signals from binary star systems consisting of neutron stars and/or black holes (called compact binary coalescences, or ""CBC's""). Its special focus will be to study the ways in which instrumental artifacts (called ""glitches"") can mimic genuine signals, and to develop new tools to distinguish glitches from genuine signals. Because the gravitational waveforms from binaries can be very well predicted, some special techniques have already been developed that help make the distinction. However, these methods do not suffice for the full range of binaries expected to be seen with Advanced LIGO. The Syracuse group will develop new tools that will work on these more vulnerable kinds of signals. <br/><br/> The Syracuse group will support the search with Advanced LIGO (""aLIGO"") for CBC signals in its first observing run (called ""O1"") with three basic approaches. Firstly, they will tune, run, and apply the special diagnostic tool called ""Daily CBC"", which gives rapid feedback to commissioners on any departures of aLIGO data from Gaussianity. Secondly, they will develop a new specially-focused version of LIGO's standard tool for investigating the statistical correlation between glitches and candidate signals, hveto; because of the long duration of CBC signals, it is necessary to implement a tuned time-shift method before asking if a glitch is coincident in time with a CBC signal. Finally, they will use related technology to implement a new statistical test that measures whether the data yielding a candidate signal looks more like a true signal or like a glitch. These techniques will enable searches for CBC signals in O1 (and beyond) to live up to their potential, making it substantially more likely that aLIGO will be succeed in detecting signals from these fascinating objects."
0.330561,"Recent observations have shown that about 70% of the energy density in the universe cannot be attributed to matter. The simplest explanation of this `dark energy' comes from the cosmological constant that Einstein had initially introduced in his fundamental equations of general relativity. However, for most of the 20th century, it was widely believed that the cosmological constant is zero because all observations were compatible with this simplest possibility. Therefore, the detailed mathematical theories describing the dynamics of compact astronomical objects such as colliding black holes and neutron stars, and gravitational waves they source, was based on this assumption. The goal of the first part of this project is to systematically extend that theory to include a non-zero cosmological constant. The extension will provide a firmer foundation for gravitational wave science. The second part of the project contains studies at the interface of strong gravity and quantum physics. They address fundamental issues related to the quantum evaporation of black holes and the physics of the earliest epoch of our universe when gravity is strong and quantum physics indispensable. The proposed research will have an impact on a broad range of research areas, including general relativity, geometric analysis, cosmology, quantum field theory, and computational science. As a result, through this research, young scientists will be trained in inter-disciplinary science. Currently, these researchers include members of under-represented groups. Through his editorship of series commemorating the centennial of the discovery of general relativity, the PI will commission monographs aimed at communicating the latest advances in science and technology to young researchers. Finally, as in the past, personnel supported by this grant will contribute vigorously to outreach activities through videos, semi-popular articles and public lectures.<br/><br/>The first part of the project will address issues arising from the fact that even a tiniest value if the cosmological constant can cast a long shadow on the theory of gravitational waves. As of now, we do not even have a gauge invariant notion of gravitational waves in full, non-linear general relativity with a positive cosmological constant. The goal is to construct a rigorous framework to fill this gap and use it to extract the physics of gravitational waves in a more reliable fashion. The results will open new avenues for analytic and numerical work in the study of the gravitational collapse, compact binary coalescence, energy, momentum and angular momentum emission in such processes, post-Newtonian and post-Minkowskian approximation methods, etc. They are also likely to stimulate research in geometric analysis through new mathematical conjectures (related to positivity of a new notion of energy). The second part of the project will address two types of issues: i) the conceptually fundamental question of whether information is lost in evaporation of black holes; and, ii) the emerging interplay between loop quantum gravity and observations related to the very early universe. This is possible because loop quantum cosmology is now sufficiently mature to make predictions for future observations based on its pre-inflationary dynamics, and to use current observations to seek fundamental principles that presumably dictate the initial conditions for our universe."
0.07757,"This research project will advance the science behind the emerging discipline of gravitational wave astronomy -- an area which the US is deeply invested in through the NSF LIGO project. One of the strongest sources of gravitational radiation is the merger of two black holes and therefore it is critical to develop a full understanding of the dynamics of such a binary system. Our work will make important contributions to this effort in the context of large mass-ratio black hole binary systems i.e. when one member of the binary is a supermassive black hole and the other is a solar-mass sized object. More specifically, we will significantly advance the development of our Kerr space-time perturbation theory based approach (the Teukolsky formalism) in the time-domain to tackle a variety of challenging problems such as: high-accuracy gravitational waveform generation and the development of effective-one-body models, that will ultimately positively impact the data analysis of current and future observatories; understanding the ""anti-kick"" which is an intriguing aspect of the phenomenon of gravitational recoil observed in such binary systems; validating full numerical relativity simulations; testing the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture in the context of the capture of a small test particle by a near extremal Kerr black hole, and more. Thus, our research activities will contribute to a number of challenging and important problems in the area of gravitational wave physics.<br/><br/>Our research work will involve undergraduate and graduate students throughout, therefore directly contributing to the education and training mission of the university. In addition, the proposed research will establish new collaborations, between individuals and institutions. We will also frequently participate in outreach activities thus promoting science awareness and public knowledge on current scientific research. Such outreach will be done through media interviews and stories and also through a dedicated publicly accessible website. We will also establish a ""waveform server"" that would freely allow any user to generate the gravitational waves for any large mass-ratio black hole binary system using a simple web based interface. In this manner, any individual would be in a position to make use such data for a project or a study of their own interest. Lastly, because our research activities will contribute to the development of broad mathematical, computational and web-related tools, and also to the education and training of students, this project's impact will likely extend beyond its research area and thus potentially benefit other scientific and engineering disciplines. The mathematical and computational skills developed by the supported students will open them up to possible employment to a wide variety of technical positions, including those associated with great current national need."
0.18553,"The research program at Carleton has a history of applying novel statistical strategies for parameter estimation and the analysis of data from LIGO. The Carleton team and its collaborators have made significant progress in developing methods for binary inspiral gravitational wave event detection. The group's on-going research is in the development of programs for even more complex binary inspiral signals, including the plunge, and the ringing of the newly formed black hole as well as supernova produced signals. When detection occurs, parameter estimation will provide the path toward astrophysics, and the Carleton-developed routines will be critical in that task. Additionally, the Carleton group searches for sources of noise that produce deleterious effects. Carleton develops vetoes for binary inspiral-like events produced by local environmental or detector disturbances; the group also assists the European Virgo detector in their burst and binary inspiral veto development, and will continue to do so with Advanced Virgo. <br/><br/>Carleton is a leader in producing future scientists. This project will provide research opportunities to students with interests in physics and statistics, and help to train them to become the next generation of scientists. Carleton students are eager to participate in exciting research, and their interest in gravitational wave astronomy is large. The computational methods developed by the PI and collaborators have had significant influence in other fields, with applications in cosmic microwave background analyses, noisy chaotic systems, and proposed space-based gravitational wave detectors. Carleton faculty, including the PI, are also active in scientific outreach. High school students and teachers are regularly exposed to the wonder and significance of LIGO's research, and this outreach creates much excitement for science."
0.198343,"Hardware upgrades to the Advanced LIGO observatories are complete and soon the most sensitive gravitational wave (GW) detectors the world has ever seen will begin collecting data. Sophisticated data analysis methods are needed to take full advantage of the improved sensitivity and make GW astronomy a reality. Previous analyses have used simplifying assumptions about the detector noise, data calibration, and in some cases the GW signal itself, hindering our ability to make confident detection claims or accurately infer the nature of a GW signal. The research enabled by this award will advance GW data analysis by improving our ability to detect and characterize transient astrophysical signals. The broad theme of the work supported by this award is to build a detailed model of LIGO data including instrument noise, calibration uncertainty, and GW signals. The resulting data analysis methods will improve detection efficiency and reduce systematic errors in parameter estimation. This award will also allow the PI to continue participating in impactful education and public outreach activities and to do so in a region of the United States which has little exposure to gravitational physics. Outreach activities related to this award will include interactions with area high schools, colleges, and universities to publicize the exciting science being done by Advanced LIGO.<br/><br/>Research supported by this award will advance three main topics in LIGO data analysis: (i) Un-modeled gravitational wave signals present a challenge for detection and parameter estimation because the signals are rare while transient noise events, or 'glitches', are common. We will complete initial development and then continue to upgrade the BayesWave and BayesLine data analysis pipelines, which together are the state-of-the-art method for distinguishing between burst signals and glitches and drawing inferences about physical properties of the GW source. (ii) The breakthrough technology used by BayesWave and BayesLine is a realistic model for the LIGO noise. The deployment of this model is most mature in the burst analysis; however, all GW searches compete with the same instrument noise. We will adapt the BayesLine algorithm to work with the parameter estimation pipeline, LALInference, for compact binary coalescence signals. (iii) The LIGO data must be calibrated, and there are small statistical uncertainties in amplitude and phase as a result. Previous source characterization analyses have not incorporated uncertainty in the calibration in their data analysis method. The BayesLine algorithm provides the foundation for modeling calibration errors and will be modified to account for systematic phase and amplitude uncertainty in compact binary and burst parameter estimation.

0.15,"This award supports the continued development, assessment, and dissemination of Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILT) and peer-instruction tools for undergraduate courses to prepare future scientists and engineers for the demands of the high-tech workplace. A solid grasp of the fundamental principles of quantum physics is essential for most scientists and engineers, considering that the global economy has become increasingly dependent on science and technology based upon quantum phenomena. Single electron transistors, SQUIDs, quantum-well lasers, and other innovative quantum devices are made possible by an understanding of the underlying quantum processes. However, quantum physics is a technically difficult and abstract subject. The subject matter makes instruction quite challenging; able students constantly struggle to master basic concepts. To sustain U.S. leadership in science and technology, it is critical to ensure that advanced undergraduate students (and graduate students) preparing for careers in science and engineering develop a solid grasp of the fundamental concepts of quantum physics.<br/><br/>QuILTs and peer-instruction tools are based upon a cognitive-apprenticeship model of learning and emphasize modeling, coaching and weaning. To aid instructors, the concept-based and problem-based QuILTs and peer-instruction tools will be keyed with most of the common textbooks. However, every effort will be made to ensure that the different modules fit together as a coherent whole and help students organize their knowledge in a hierarchical fashion. Some tools expose students to contemporary and exciting topics such as quantum cryptography that can be taught using simple two-level systems."
0.6,"Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a technique which allows users to measure concentrations of rare elements with superior sensitivity. With many applications in a wide range of scientific fields, this fast, multi-element technique has become an indispensable tool in trace elemental analysis. This award will be used to establish an ICP-MS at Black Hills State University (BHSU) that will provide high sensitivity analysis capabilities for researchers in South Dakota and surrounding areas. The ICP-MS will be used by researchers in many disciplines including Physics, Chemistry, Geology, and Engineering. Undergraduate students will be involved in sample preparation, operation, instrument maintenance, and data analysis. This will expand BHSU's program of undergraduate research in the Black Hills region and throughout the state of South Dakota and increase the exposure of undergraduate students to state-of-the-art instrumentation. ICP-MS labs and training will be incorporated into Analytical Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, Hydrogeology, Volcanology, Mineralogy and Petrology classes serving a combined estimated 90 students per year. BHSU's close proximity to six of the nine Indian reservations in South Dakota results in a large enrollment of American Indian students, many of whom will benefit from the acquisition of the ICP-MS.<br/><br/>With this ICP-MS, BHSU will be capable of screening the radio-purity of materials used in rare-event physics experiments at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). The ICP-MS facility will also be used in support of SURF projects by characterizing the germanium crystals grown at the University of South Dakota and at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and in the study of ancient metamorphosed basalts in and near SURF. Additional geological applications include petrogenesis studies of volcanic and metavolcanic rocks, paleoenvironmental analyses, research of biotic responses to past climate change and analyses of the incorporation and impact of trace metals and organic compounds derived from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on coastal molluscan species in the Gulf of Mexico. Assessing the toxicity of nanomaterials for renewable energy generation, evaluating lanthanide dopant concentration in upconversion nanomaterials and the determination of complex ferrite compositions and impurities in attrition milled and surface functionalized metallic and intermetallic nanopowders are among the chemistry applications."
0.095,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Lara B. Anderson at Virginia Tech. <br/><br/>Fundamental particle physics is at a critical moment in its development. New studies at the Large Hadron Collider, the Planck satellite and other experiments will give new information on possible physics beyond the Standard Model. This project is motivated by this goal. It is focused on string theory, which hopes to unify gravity with the other fundamental forces. String theory is only manifest at very high energy scales. To connect with experiment, the project concentrates on the development of ""string phenomenology"" - the aspect of string theory that attempts to bridge the gap between the high-energy, extra-dimensional formalism of string theory, and the low-energy, four-dimensional world of particles and forces. Despite the importance of string theory as the only known consistent quantum theory of gravity and its enormous power and flexibility for so-called ""top down"" model building in high energy physics, it is only recently that explicit low-energy limits of string theory have started to be developed to a level that makes serious interdisciplinary contact between string and particle phenomenology possible. Within string theory, the roles of physics and mathematics are intrinsically intertwined, and progress in string phenomenology requires cutting edge tools in modern mathematics. This project involves three of the primary approaches to particle phenomenology in string theory and interlinked approaches to string theory, algebraic geometry and high-speed mathematical computing. Now is the time to attempt to answer the question: can string theory give a description of the real world? And at last, with interdisciplinary mathematical and physical approaches and expanding computational power, string phenomenology is capable of doing just that. By exploring these new geometries, it may be possible to find a view of string theory that looks profoundly similar to the world we observe. <br/><br/>In heterotic string theory, the PI will generate a database of hundreds of billions of heterotic models (composed of Calabi-Yau 3-folds and vector bundles defined over them) and the analytic and algorithmic tools necessary to completely analyze the geometries and compute their local and topological data. The PI will also use new approaches in computational algebraic geometry to address long-standing phenomenological challenges in heterotic theory such as moduli stabilization and the determination of the full 4-dimensional, N=1 lagrangian (including the Kahler potential and normalized Yukawa couplings). Using the same mathematical toolkit outlined above, she will also study model building within global F-theory constructions. Despite being one of the most promising stringy approaches to particle phenomenology, F-theory is not fully understood. It is the goal to contribute to a rigorous framework for F-theory model building by systematically studying the geometry of Calabi-Yau 4-folds and the 2-dimensional cycles (or holes) within them that 7-branes wrap. In addition, the PI will explore new avenues of model building by introducing non-Abelian gauge field vacuum expectation values (vector bundles) over 7-brane stacks. Finally, the PI will study compact singular manifolds with G2 holonomy as backgrounds for M-theory and will also investigate the special (singular) points in 7-dimensional spaces of G2 holonomy (and their intersections), and derive the explicit 4-dimensional effective field theory of a compactification of M-theory in the neighborhood of these singularities. The PI hopes for the first time to produce globally defined G2 compactifications of M-theory. A combination of these three approaches should yield a new view of string phenomenology in string theory."
0.114754,"This award funds the research of Prof. David Chernoff at Cornell University. Substantial theoretical and observational evidence supports the occurrence of inflation at very early times, a brief interval of extremely rapid expansion of the Universe shortly after birth. The mechanism is a profound problem for cosmology and fundamental physics. String theory, the best-developed tool to explore this epoch, suggests that today our Universe may contain relics of that early, energetic phase. The relics are loops of string stretched from microscopic scales to macroscopic scales by the rapid expansion. The proposed research investigates the physics of string loops and possibilities for detecting them. Astronomical detection would be a revolutionary development for string theory and cosmology. Such a discovery would provide a direct glimpse of otherwise inaccessible elements of the underlying physical theory. It would help elucidate the mechanism for inflation while extending our study of the universe to the earliest moments of the big bang itself.<br/><br/>At the very beginning, the universe is believed to have grown exponentially in size via the mechanism of inflation. The almost scale-invariant density perturbation spectrum predicted by inflation is strongly supported by recent observational data. Subsequent evolution, the traditional purview of big bang cosmology, can be accurately modeled with tried-and-true physics. However, the precise inflationary mechanism remains a profound problem for cosmology and for fundamental physics. Intellectual Merit: String theory, the best-developed tool to explore this epoch, suggests the inevitable birth and survival of one-dimensional structures of cosmological sizes, namely, cosmic superstrings. Long, horizon-crossing strings fragment to give loops which fall into growing matter perturbations. The local density of these fossil remnant loops within the galaxy is enhanced over the universe's mean density of loops by many orders of magnitude and numerous loops exist within the galaxy. The PI will investigate how these relics can be sought by optical lensing of background stars and studied in detail through gravitational wave emission. These objects will provide some of the best experimental means to learn about string theory and the birth of our universe. Broader Impacts: As part of this proposal (1) The PI will help train postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates in theoretical physics and cosmology. (2) The PI is committed to publicizing the big questions of theoretical physics and cosmology that motivate the work. The PI will speak in local science museums and help bring the research to life for general audiences."
0.15,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the mass of the Higgs boson has the value it has. To answer these questions it is necessary to go beyond the present picture of the Universe described by the Standard Model to the next phase of development, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Investigations in BSM physics probe such questions as why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. This award will contribute to this search through measurements made of the decay of charged K mesons, a rare process. The award will also continue the impressive effort in broadening the participation in fundamental research, through its participation in QuarkNet and through a separate NSF IRES (International Research Experience for Students) grant that brings up to five undergraduates to CERN each summer, with applicants selected from a consortium of universities and colleges in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area.<br/><br/>Searches for evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model can be addressed through direct searches at the Energy Frontier at High Energy Colliding Beam Facilities such as the LHC and through a complementary technique of indirect searches at the Intensity Frontier, in experimental measurements of very-rare decay modes of known particles. This award focuses on continued research with the NA62 experiment at CERN, which is a measurement of the rare decay of the charged K meson through the process, K+ -> pion+, neutrino, anti-neutrino. This decay is well-predicted in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and a precision experimental measurement of the actual rate could provide evidence for new physics, if the observed rate differs significantly from the theoretical prediction. This award will provide help in all aspects of NA62, with responsibilities in event trigger logic, trigger hardware and front-end electronics communication, slow controls, and a counter for the detection of kaons in the beam line."
0.733767,"The observation of neutrinoless double beta decay will help determine the masses of neutrinos, discover lepton number violation and reveal if two-component Majorana fermions exist in Nature. EXO, a multi-tonne neutrinoless double beta decay experiment employing xenon enriched to ~80% in the isotope Xenon-136, is now taking data at the WIPP underground site in New Mexico. However, the next generation of such experiments requires advanced background reduction methods to reach Majorana neutrino mass sensitivities below 0.01 eV.<br/><br/>EXO is developing a novel technique to tag the Barium (Ba) produced in the final state of the neutrinoless double beta decay using atomic spectroscopy. This technique has the promise of drastically reducing radioactive backgrounds, providing a clean and un-ambiguous measurement with unprecedented sensitivity. Recent breakthroughs have been obtained in the Ba-tagging front. These groups have produced, for the first time, Ba transport and tagging efficiencies above 1%. The R&D work funded with this award builds on such breakthroughs and aspires to provide the first demonstration of high efficiency tagging of individual Ba atoms in liquid xenon. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: While the primary scientific goal of this proposal is in the field of neutrino physics, its broader impact is substantial. The techniques being developed span a range of topics, from nuclear and particle astrophysics, to AMO, surface physics and material science. This research, if successful, is likely to be applicable to other problems in science and technology, where the high efficiency transfer and identification of single atoms would be of interest. Examples include trace analysis for homeland security applications and the detection of rare phenomena. The team is also planning to continue the summer program integrating high school teachers into their labs."
0.12,"The research funded by this award is designed to promote a better understanding of atomic nuclei, the basic building blocks of all normal matter in the Universe. How did they form following the Big Bang, and how do they now interact to change their basic elemental nature? Are there new forms of matter made up from very exotic types of atomic nuclei and how might we make and study these? To this end the group will develop special new techniques in nuclear science, as well as train future scientists that can help answer some of these questions. One important training component will be a continuation of the well-established and highly successful outreach to faculty and students at New Buffalo High School in Michigan that has introduced these students to interesting, important, and exciting careers in the sciences. The technology developed and used in this research will have applications in other important areas, such as homeland security (nuclear terrorism), the safe storage and monitoring of nuclear wastes, and applications in nuclear medicine, including radiation therapy. The latter includes a new modality directly related to this research: the production and imaging of ion beams to treat particular forms of cancer tumors. Nearly 50% of graduate students and other personnel trained in the group's past research projects are currently pursuing careers in nuclear security or nuclear medicine, and it is anticipated that this will continue as a result of the present grant.<br/><br/>The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing stable as well as short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies. This includes use of the TwinSol low-energy radioactive ion-beam facility in operation at the University of Notre Dame (ND), developed jointly by the University of Michigan (UM) and ND. Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability to elucidate the effect that the exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier. Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity to the continuum is the characteristic defining feature of weakly-bound systems. These studies will be carried out at TwinSol in collaboration with a group from the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), utilizing a prototype active-target time-projection chamber (AT-TPC). A related program will use the full AT-TPC recently commissioned at the reaccelerated beam facility (ReA3) at NSCL. <br/><br/>In addition, the UM-UND collaboration, under the primary direction of the UM research group and their colleagues, will continue advanced development and application of deuterated scintillators for nuclear measurements involving neutrons. This will include selected measurements of (d,n) and (3He,n) reactions involving both stable and unstable beams, and in particular 7Be(d,n) which is of interest in astrophysics. Since these detectors permit neutron spectroscopy and cross section measurements without neutron time-of-flight, they have a particular advantage when used with the high-intensity, low-energy, non-pulsed accelerators suitable for nuclear astrophysics measurements. The latter includes the new 5 MV accelerator recently installed at ND and we will pursue such experiments, and in particular several key (A,n) measurements, together with the nuclear astrophysics group at ND. <br/><br/>The unique neutron detector array the group has recently developed has potential for wide-spread applications both in nuclear science as well as in homeland-security and nuclear non-proliferation. As in the past, the proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from ND and UM, together with faculty members and students from several primarily undergraduate schools located in close proximity to these universities. The highly-technical nature of the proposed research will thus contribute significantly to the training of a technically-literate work force."
0.185669,"The purpose of this project is to further develop a general and effective, fully relativistic computer code for electron and photon interactions with atoms, ions, and molecules using the B-spline R-matrix (BSR) method. This innovative approach has significant advantages over the standard suite of R-matrix codes, mostly developed over the past four decades in Belfast and currently used worldwide. Specifically, the excellent numerical properties of a B-spline basis allow for high computational accuracy, and the ability to employ non-orthogonal sets of term-dependent orbitals allows for compact configuration expansions. During the current funding period, the existing computer code will be fully parallelized, and a new suite of general atomic structure codes will be developed, which directly use the B-spline as an improved interface to the BSR collision codes. Furthermore, a parallelized B-spline code to solve the close-coupling equations in the outer region will be developed, and a pilot version of the BSR program to treat time-dependent processes, such as intense short-pulse XUV laser-atom interactions, will be extended to double ionization and infrared radiation. Finally, the potential use of the BSR method to describe electron and photon interactions with diatomic molecules will be investigated.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the project consists of the further development of a highly successful suite of computer programs to calculate accurate atomic data for a wide variety of electron- and photon-driven processes. The production calculations will focus on atomic targets, for which these data are of critical value to model the physics and chemistry of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres. This work will support many experimental projects ranging from industrial lighting systems to fundamental research performed at next-generation synchrotrons and free-electron lasers. The results will be presented at international scientific meetings, and the next version of the computer code will be written up and made available to the public. Finally, undergraduate students will be trained through developing and testing individual modules of the package. This includes running the code on massively parallel computing platforms provided through XSEDE resources."
1.56,"This award funds work done by the Stanford High Energy Theory Group. The faculty personnel on this award are Professors Savas Dimopoulos, Renata Kallosh, Shamit Kachru, Andrei Linde, Stephen Shenker, Eva Silverstein and Leonard Susskind. <br/><br/>Under this award, this group will engage in a broad program of research at the leading edge of theoretical physics. Dimopoulos will pursue the correct theoretical interpretation of data from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN as it sharpens over the next years. He will also continue his focus on astrophysical probes of dark matter and on novel methods of detecting gravitational waves. Kallosh, Linde and Silverstein will work at the interface of inflation with fundamental theory, including the embedding of new classes of models into supergravity and string theory. Furthermore, Linde, Shenker and Susskind will continue their studies of the mysteries of eternal inflation, while Silverstein's program of research will tie these pieces to an interlinked, concrete program of studying field theory in time-dependent backgrounds. Kachru and Silverstein propose to use holography in Anti de Sitter (AdS) space to understand novel phases of quantum field theory at finite density, and Kachru is pursuing a complementary program of research on pure field theory questions with possible applications to condensed matter systems. Shenker proposes a program of research to unearth further lessons from new dualities involving higher-spin theories of gravity, while Kachru, Shenker and Susskind will pursue recent advances in the theory of black holes.<br/><br/>The PI's also have a consistent history of pursuing the broader impacts of their research, and will continue to do so during the period of this award. They will devote substantial energy toward the training of graduate students and postdocs, who represent the future of this field. They will also continue their efforts to reach the broader public. In the past these broader impacts have taken the form of appearances in popular television shows, public lectures, participation in events such as the World Science Festival, authorship of popular books and magazine articles, organizational work that benefits the field as a whole, and interdisciplinary teaching. These activities will continue at a high level during this award."
0.232345,"One very bizarre thing that we learn from quantum mechanics is that it is possible for an object to be in a superposition of two or more states at once. For example, in our experiment we will use optical transitions driven by pairs of laser beams to put strontium ions into a superposition state in which the ion is essentially in two different places at the same time. Quantum mechanics also tells us, however, that if you look to see what state an object is in, the process of measuring will collapse the system into a single state. So, although we will be able to ""split"" ions and put them in two different physical locations at the same time, we will never be able to detect them at two different locations at the same time.<br/><br/>The fact that we can never actually ""see"" the ions in two places at once might make it sound like there is no point in doing the experiment. But there is a trick to making this superposition useful. What we will do, as has been done in neutral atom interferometers, is to put the two pieces back together, such that each ion is in a single location, before measuring its state. When we put the pieces back together, the ions will ""remember"" things it felt at both of the locations they occupied when they were in the superposition state, and that ""memory"" will affect the internal state of the ions when the pieces are put back together again.<br/><br/>Because ions are very sensitive to electric fields, the state that the ions end up in will be determined in part by the difference in the electrostatic potentials at the different locations that the ions experienced. Using laser fluorescence to probe the state of the ions at the end of the experiment, we should be able to detect electric fields with unprecedented precision. This will allow us to do fundamental tests of the laws of electromagnetism - to see if there are perhaps some subtle differences between nature's laws and our mathematical description of them. We will also be able to probe electric fields above surfaces coherently, allowing us to study things like scattering of electron pairs in superconductors."
0.46,"This grant enables the PIs to continue and expand their research program on the formation, dynamics, and applications of ultracold molecules at sub-miliKelvin temperatues. Prior research by the group has focused on diatomic alkali molecules produced by the process of ultracold photoassociation, in which pairs of ultracold alkali metal atoms are associated into bound vibrational levels of electronically excited molecular states. These electronically excited molecules then decay by spontaneous emission of light, some to near-dissociation rovibrational levels of the singlet ground state (the X state) or the metastable triplet state (the a state). New experiments will focus on methods to efficiently create KRb and Rb2 molecules in the lowest rovibrational levels of both the stable X state, X(v=0, J=0), and the metastable a(0,0) state. The program also includes related studies of radiative lifetimes and collisions.<br/><br/>Two promising methods for continuous and simple production of X(0,0) are: (1) resonance-enhanced coupling of two different electronic states, one with long-range character to enhance photoassociation and the other with short-range character to enhance decay to X(0,0); (2) Feshbach-Optimized Photoassociation (FOPA) in a magnetic field to greatly enhance photoassociation rates by mixing of high levels of the X and a states, again to enhance the short-range character of the wave function. For the metastable a(0,0) state, a novel ""blue-detuned"" photoassociation scheme can produce large populations, and is being used to study the purely radiative lifetime at low density as well as inelastic and reactive collisions in an optical trap.<br/><br/>By trapping ultracold molecules at high densities, the group seeks to observe for the first time ultracold atom-molecule photoassociation. This will produce ultracold triatomic molecules such as Rb3 and KRb2 in previously unexplored excited states, which can be detected either by laser ionization or autoionization.<br/><br/>Interest in X(0,0) molecules is particularly strong because only in this quantum state can it be assured that collisions will not cause heating due to changes in the internal quantum state. This enables long trapping times and investigations of subtle quantum interactions. Possible applications of cold polar molecules for quantum information are of great current interest, and at high enough densities even a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate becomes a possibility. The new production methods explored in this project offer large advantages in simplicity over alternative approaches such as Raman transfer in quantum degenerate gases, and they enable continuous or near-continuous generation of cold molecules. Systematic studies of the spectroscopy and dynamics of these cold molecules will provide much-needed data and physical insights to inform future investigations of both ultracold and room-temperature molecules.<br/><br/>The project will be well-integrated into the large ultracold physics program at the University of Connecticut, currently including seven faculty and about 40 students and postdoctoral fellows. Elements of this integration include project-based group meetings, mentoring, workshops, seminars, and numerous national and international collaborations. Presentations by our research group members locally and at meetings and other educational institutions contribute to scientific understanding. Broader long term benefits include new understanding and applications in areas such as ultracold chemistry, measurements of fundamental symmetries and physical constants, quantum information science, and nanoscience, as well as improved international collaboration."
0.873998,"The Northern Illinois University group is completing its transition from the D0 experiment at Fermilab to the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as its core program. On ATLAS, Northern Illinois has operational responsibilities and electronics upgrades for hadron calorimetry (the ATLAS TileCal) and in simulation and algorithm development for the Fast TracKer (FTK) Trigger. These activities are central to the improved performance of ATLAS as the luminosity of the LHC increases. The NIU program of physics analysis focuses on studies of top quarks, vector bosons (W/Z), and direct photon production. They are also involved in the search for the decays of Higgs bosons into tau leptons, which could be an indicator of new, Beyond-the-Standard-Model phenomena.<br/><br/>The Northern Illinois group continues to be very active in detector development, particularly in the domain of calorimetry and muon detection, and has joined the Fermilab Mu2e experiment, among whose objectives is the search for muon conversion into electrons and hence lepton number violation.<br/><br/>Outreach to K-12 teachers and the general public is an integral part of the Northern Illinois program. The group initiated physics outreach on the campus in 2001, a program of effort that is now merged into the university's STEM outreach program.

0.33999,"This research project will study the properties of Holmium atoms. The Holmium atom has one of the most complex internal structures of any element and our knowledge of its properties is incomplete. Detailed measurements will be made of the atomic structure of Holmium. Experimental methods using lasers and electromagnetic fields will be developed to prepare different internal states and to measure interactions between Holmium atoms. These measurements and methods will provide a foundation for future applications of Holmium to information processing. In addition the project will train scientists in modern techniques of atomic physics and prepare them for careers in academia and industry. The results of this research will be disseminated to the local public in the Madison, Wisconsin area through open houses in the Physics department, through visits to local schools, and by providing internships for local high school students. <br/><br/>The rare earth element Holmium (Ho) has a 128 dimensional ground state manifold, the largest of any stable atomic isotope. Experiments will use a Magneto-Optical Trap of Ho atoms, recently demonstrated in the Saffman laboratories. Optical control techniques using rf and microwave fields will be developed to prepare specific Zeeman substates in the 128 dimensional ground manifold. Rydberg states will be probed using two-photon excitation and the hitherto unknown quantum defects of the Ho Rydberg states will be measured. The quantum defects will be used to develop models for effective Rydberg wavefunctions which will then be used to calculate Rydberg-Rydberg interaction strengths. The Rydberg state measurements will form the basis for Rydberg blockade experiments with Ho atoms, and the demonstration of entanglement. These studies of the ground and Rydberg state properties of Ho atoms, as well as the development of control techniques, will establish a knowledge basis for collective encoding of quantum registers in small Ho ensembles."
0.06,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Vatche Sahakian at Harvey Mudd College. The project addresses fundamental questions at the boundary of our knowledge involving general relativity and quantum mechanics, in short, quantum gravity. The proposal explores several keys ideas in string theory and quantum gravity: the accounting of information in black holes, and the understanding of black hole surface dynamics. The accounting of information in black holes has been a topic of great discussion recently, since black hole dynamics seem to violate some basic principles of quantum mechanics involving the destruction of information, and black hole surface dynamics have recently shed light on possible resolutions of this conundrum. Hence, the research addresses fundamental questions in two general areas of theoretical physics: scrambling of information in quantum information theory, and black hole physics in quantum gravity.<br/><br/>The accomplishments expected from the project are: A better understanding of the mechanics of information scrambling in black holes; A better understanding of black hole evaporation and the details of entanglement evolution in the process of transferring information from a black hole to the outside; A better understanding of the nature of the black hole horizon; The development of new highly multi-threaded algorithms in computational physics as applied to understanding black hole dynamics in string theory. An extensive undergraduate research program is part of the proposal, including: a course development component for an undergraduate course on modern topics in theoretical physics, providing students with solid foundations for graduate school; and the associated preparation of an undergraduate textbook on classical field theory."

0.339,"This research project explores uncharted regimes of 'strongly correlated matter' (matter which behaves notably differently from what one would expect based on knowledge gained by studying only the constituents in isolation) by pushing the experimental state-of-the-art in atomic physics, quantum optics, and condensed matter physics. In addition, the group actively collaborates with theoretical groups to develop frameworks for understanding these novel tools and complex systems. The project focuses on the diversity of quantum many-body phases that may arise from the unusual properties of the element dysprosium under the influence of specialized excitation by laser radiation. This program will build the experimental capability to seek these phases using the successful machine assembled under a prior NSF CAREER grant for laser cooling and trapping dysprosium. The research concerns physics and technical skills that find application in a variety of significant areas of technology, most notably lasers and photonics for telecommunications and advanced novel solid-state materials for electronic devices. The research provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student education in a state-of-the-art laser lab. <br/><br/>Several groups have realized a synthetic magnetic field using alkali atoms either in traps or in optical lattices as well as one-dimensional spin-orbit coupling. Spin-orbit coupling in a Bose gas can lead to superfluid phases with stripe order and a rich phase diagram. These achievements announce an exciting new frontier for exploring quantum many-body physics in quantum gases, connecting to existing phenomena and challenges in condensed matter systems. The group aspires to pursue brand-new phenomena barely, or perhaps not at all, realizable in the solid state by employing high-spin quantum gases of dysprosium atoms. Dysprosium (Dy) offers several advantages for realizing unusual, strongly correlated states and exotic spinor phases beyond those phases widely discussed in the context of utilizing dysprosium?s large magnetic dipole moment. The large spin and narrow optical transitions of Dy atoms should allow for the generation of synthetic magnetic fields one order of magnitude larger than those in the alkalis, but with considerable reduction of the heating rate. Consequently, creating quantum Hall states in Dy may be more practicable than in the currently employed alkali atoms."
0.119997,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Jared Kaplan at Johns Hopkins University.<br/><br/>During the last few decades, a velvet revolution has changed the way we think about spacetime, gravity, and the fundamental laws of nature. The most crucial breakthrough was the discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence, which describes gravity in d + 1 dimensions using a d-dimensional, ""holographic"" theory. The purpose of this project is to understand the robust features of a correspondence between gravitational theories in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetimes and non-gravitational theories with conformal symmetries, and to generalize this so-called ""AdS/CFT"" correspondence to other spacetimes. This will make it possible to understand the generic features of quantum gravity. Professor Kaplan will also expand on a nascent program characterizing general holographic dualities in terms of bulk effective field theories, and will study various possible generalizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence to situations in which conformal symmetry is broken.<br/><br/>This project also has several broader impacts. The proposed research will be an excellent training ground for postdocs and graduate students, with its wide variety of challenging problems that connect holography to phenomenology and experiment. Both the theoretical and phenomenological side of high-energy physics inspire others by addressing the simplest questions in profound and beautiful ways, thereby drawing students into important STEM careers while providing them with rigorous quantitative skills. Professor Kaplan will also be actively engaged in teaching and mentoring at Johns Hopkins University.

0.135,"This award funds the research activities of Professor David Tucker-Smith at Williams College.<br/><br/>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has already made enormous progress pushing forward the high energy frontier. During the coming years, the LHC will continue to probe some of the deepest mysteries in particle physics, including the origin of elementary particle masses and the nature of dark matter. In his research, Professor Tucker-Smith studies extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, with an emphasis on understanding how these theories can be tested at the LHC. As part of this project, Professor Tucker-Smith will study models that address a surprising experimental development from the Tevatron at Fermilab --- measurements of an anomalously large forward-backward asymmetry in top-antitop production. He will also study the LHC phenomenology of theories with a particular type of new force carrier, theories incorporating new ideas for dark matter, and theories in which the Higgs sector, the part of the model responsible for generating the masses of the elementary particles, differs from that of the Standard Model.<br/><br/>This project will also have signficant broader impacts.

0.308862,"Non-technical description:<br/>Lasers and other light sources will be used to measure the properties of negative ions, which are atoms and molecules that have an extra electron. High-precision measurements of how tightly the extra electron is bound will be useful for modeling chemical reactions and plasma interactions for such practical applications as the manufacturing of semiconductors for computers and other electronic devices. The detailed studies of negative ions will yield insights into ""dynamical many-body interactions"" which are central to understanding how collections of particles behave differently from what one would expect from the knowledge gained by studying single particles in isolation. These interactions are general phenomenon of interest for a broad range of fields in physics, chemistry, and materials science, including nanotechnology. The project will enhance the research and teaching infrastructure of Denison University, an undergraduate college. Students will participate in the experiments both on-campus and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, providing important research experiences for young scientists including technical training in electronics, computers, lasers, and optics.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>This project studies the interactions of photons with negative ions in two related series of experiments. The extra electron in a negative ion is bound predominantly by electron correlation effects and therefore negative ions provide a fertile testing ground for state-of-the-art atomic physics calculations regarding these multi-body interactions. In the first series of experiments, complex atomic negative ions are investigated on-campus at Denison University using tunable infrared laser light to detach outer-shell electrons. The ground and upper state photodetachment thresholds of several lanthanide and Group III negative ions (gallium and possibly thallium) will be measured in order to determine the electron affinities and energy levels. There is currently strong disagreement between theoretical predictions and experimental photoelectron spectroscopy results for these systems. The faculty and student researchers will also investigate resonances and bound excited states in lanthanide ions including bound-bound electric-dipole transitions that exist in the negative ions of cerium and lanthanum. The second series of complementary experiments will investigate inner-shell photodetachment from the negative ions of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon chains of n numbers of carbon atoms (O-, H-, C_n-) and other atomic and molecular species using high energy (12-1000 eV) photons at the Advanced Light Source synchrotron. These experiments continue the PIs' investigations into the effects of the outer-shell electrons on the detaching inner electron's wavefunction. The dynamic multi-electron interactions in the photoexcitation of the highly correlated cores of negative ions continue to challenge the fundamental understanding of atomic structure. Investigations into heavy negative ions and detection of the neutral decay products will test the latest theories describing inner-shell photodetachment."
0.327403,"Global positioning systems and rapid data communication require the ability to precisely measure time. The most precise timing systems rely on the use of lasers to extract energy from atom or ions (so-called ""laser-cooling"" techniques) in order to remove uncertainty due to the atom or ion motion. Only relatively recently have these laser-cooling techniques been demonstrated to work on molecules. The scientific goal of this project is to demonstrate the laser cooling of a trapped molecular ion, which could have potential future applications in the precise measurement of time and some of the fundamental physical constants of nature (the numbers which ultimately determine quantitatively how everything in the universe behaves).<br/><br/>The initial target ion for laser-cooling is BH+. (BH is a molecule consisting of one boron atom bonded to one hydrogen atom.) The challenge of laser cooling molecules is the extra degrees of freedom relative to atomic ions. BH+ has a level structure similar to SrF, a recently cooled molecule, and we propose to implement a similar scheme. (SrF is a molceule consisting of one stronium atom bonded to one one fluorine atom.) The key difference is that the expected vibrational decay rate of BH+ is significantly faster. This leads to a broader distribution of rotational states and additional care is required to close the transition. In addition, the excited electronic state of BH+ can predissociate to an unbound state of the ground electronic state. This dissociation rate is predicted to be slow enough that laser cooling will still be possible. If successful, this project will result in the first laser cooling of a trapped molecular ion. The potential failure of the project due to predissociation will give us additional insight into slow hydrogen tunneling processes and serve as a test for theories of the quantum dynamics of molecules. An ideal outcome is the formation of a molecular ion Coulomb crystal for the study of cold chemistry and the precision measurement of molecular vibrations."
0.012,"Twice annually, regional meetings on mathematical string theory are held in central North Carolina at Duke University. These meetings inexpensively fill a critical need, by regularly bringing together isolated research groups to collaborate and hear research talks, and also by training students and postdocs both by exposing them to a wide array of ideas as well as giving them a forum in which to themselves give talks, thereby substantially aiding both training and research efforts. The location of these meetings allows for substantial impact, as Duke is one of three major universities within a forty-minute drive of one another, all of which have researchers working in related areas, and is centrally located with regards to a number of other universities and related researchers within driving distance. Duke's existing facilities will be used to record lectures and post them on the web, allowing for even greater impact. Efforts are being made to involve more underrepresented minorities and genders, both as participants and as speakers. Partial funding for these meetings in the form of participant support is awarded for the next three years. In addition, funds may be used to provide travel support for speakers traveling from outside the region. The support will enhance the quality of these meetings and their contribution to regional collaborations. It will especially contribute to the training of students and postdocs in the region who will be more readily able to attend. The availability of travel support for outside speakers will make it possible to attract outside visitors, including members of under-represented minorities."
0.3,"Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>Using high-intensity ultra-fast laser pulses we can now control both the bond length and orientation of diatomic molecules. This gives us a unique opportunity to directly probe the structure of molecular orbitals and ask fundamental questions; such as, is there coherence between the different orbitals and how do relativistic orbitals differ from regular orbitals? In addition to probing molecular structure, we will also use our ability to manipulate molecules in order to generate highly excited states of the molecular ions with the ultimate goal of creating population inversions in the vacuum-ultraviolet spectral region. Finally, we will test our hypothesis that certain configurations of the molecule may be highly susceptible to generating harmonic radiation driven by an intense fundamental laser. Moreover, we have developed a new phase-matching technique that greatly enhances the efficiency of harmonic generation, in general. Coupling these two techniques together may provide a new source of intense short-pulse vacuum-ultraviolet radiation.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The new phase-matching techniques may lead to a new class of coherent, ultra short pulse VUV radiation sources. The strong field techniques developed in this award may lead to important insights into molecular structure useful for physical chemistry. More broadly, interest in high-harmonic generation, attosecond physics, and short-pulse x-ray free electron lasers has exploded over the past decade, and this award contributes towards understanding important aspects such as inner-orbital ionization, excitation, and vibrational coherence. Finally, this award provides hands on research training in state-of-the-art laser and optical technologies and prepares them for academic or high-tech career paths."
0.032913,"Particle Physics is the science of discovery of the fundamental constituents of matter and energy and is involved in the exploration of the Universe from the smallest to the largest scales. A remarkable achievement of Twentieth Century Particle Physics was the development of the Standard Model that describes impressively well a broad spectrum of fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons and the interactions (the forces) among them. But the Standard Model is incomplete and we know there is important physics that lies beyond it. What is the evidence? As an example, astronomical observations indicate that the known particles of the Standard Model make up only 1/6 of the total matter in the Universe. The remainder is called ""Dark Matter"" because we don't see it directly. A number of experiments are underway or in the planning stage to look for the Dark Matter, which might be one type of particle or possibly many or perhaps something else entirely. One hypothesized Dark Matter particle is called the Dark Photon (labeled the A') and it is expected to interact with the photon of the Standard Model (known to most of us as a gamma ray).<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This EArly concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) supports preliminary studies by a Cornell group led by Professor Peter Wittich to assess the technical feasibility, optimal design, physics reach, and approximate cost of a ""high risk-high payoff"" dark photon (A') search experiment at the Cornell Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory. The intended goal is to produce the A' in the reaction: (e+) + (e-) -> photon + A'. A positron (e+) beam is to be extracted from the synchrotron and directed onto a liquid hydrogen target that will provide the source of target electrons (which are constituents within the hydrogen atoms). The outgoing photon is detected in a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter and the A' itself is not detected directly, but rather is ""observed"" via its potential signature in the measured missing mass distribution.<br/><br/>The strategy of this dark photon search will differ from existing and planned experiments in several respects: (a) the dark photon is identified by a missing-mass technique, so the search does not depend on a specific decay mode, as most competing experiments do; (b) there is no assumption about dark photon lifetime, as is built into many experiments that use long beam dumps or electron-positron vertexing; and (c) there is no requirement that the dark photon decay at all. The only critical assumption needed for this search is that the dark photon should interact with ordinary photons.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses two of the science drivers of the recently released Report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (called P5): Dark Matter and the Search for New Particles and Interactions. The unique facility provided by the Cornell storage ring's positron beam would allow this group to probe a new regime in Dark Matter physics, and also to possibly help explain the so-called ""g-2 anomaly"", a potentially related and highly interesting topic of current experimental research. Searching for this kind of physics beyond the Standard Model confronts fundamental symmetries, the nature of mass, the dimensionality of space, and the cosmological origins of our universe.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposal includes training of undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research techniques associated with this EAGER project. Additionally the principal investigators on the proposal all contribute to an extensive program of outreach at Cornell: to local K-12 schools, including both in-school programs and out-of-school workshops for teachers, educators, and high school students; to the general public; and to undergraduates."

0.2,"The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. When the Advanced Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) reaches designed sensitivity as scheduled, the burst of radiation that may become the first detection of gravitational waves is already closer to the Earth than the closest star, Alfa Centauri. The gravitational waves in this first detection, and others following soon after, were very likely produced during the merger of binary systems involving black holes and/or neutron stars. There is realistic optimism that, at the turn of the decade, enough of these and other sources will be observed to state with confidence that proper observational gravitational wave physics has arrived. This will of course depend on having in place exquisite interferometric engineering, clever analysis of extremely noisy data, and state of the art source modeling. Regarding the latter, it is imperative to continue exploiting the tools of numerical relativity to model not only as many gravitational wave source scenarios as possible, but also to improve the physics content captured by the simulations. The science in this project supports directly this enterprise, namely numerical relativity modeling to enhance our understanding of sources of gravitational radiation and of gravitational phenomena driving electromagnetic signatures. The proposed research will have an impact beyond the confines of gravitational wave physics and numerical relativity. Achieving success in the multi-messenger, computing, and data-analytics projects in this project necessitates an interdisciplinary environment reaching across astrophysics, computing science and even engineering. The Center for Relativistic Astrophysics at Georgia Tech will be capable of providing such an environment since its mission is to foster research and education linking high-energy astrophysics, astro-particle physics, cosmology and gravitational wave physics.<br/><br/>This award supports research focused on the computational modeling of black holes and neutron stars as sources of gravitational radiation. The proposal considers several projects that involve astrophysics with a common denominator -- the crucial role played by dynamical gravity and the curvature of space-time. The astrophysical phenomena in these projects arise from a marriage between general relativistic gravitation and complex multi-physics involving fluid flows, electromagnetic fields, radiation transport and realistic equations of state. The effort also aims at enhancing our comprehensive understanding of astrophysical phenomena beyond what gravitational waves alone will be able to tell, in other words, electromagnetic and gravitational wave phenomena leading to multi-messenger observations. The research is organized into two areas: 1) Compact object binaries and a sandbox of simulation data; and 2) Tidal stellar disruptions by massive black holes. The proposed work will give postdocs and students the opportunity to interact with researchers in computing science and engineering, to develop and implement numerical algorithms for magneto-hydrodynamics, work with large data sets and to participate in a variety of outreach activities. The experience gained in high performance computing, optimization, data analytics, and software engineering will further the careers of young researchers participating in the effort, acquiring valuable skills that are in demand in a broad range of professions."
0.48,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics. A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations. One focus is to track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes. These processes are primary targets for gravitational wave detectors now being deployed, like LIGO, and there is an urgent need for reliable waveforms. The investigators will use a computational technique, pseudospectral collocation, that delivers high accuracy with a much smaller computational cost than other techniques.<br/>Other applications will include benchmarking of analytical approximations, such as the post-Newtonian and Effective One Body techniques; computations in difficult regimes of parameter space such as high spins and mass ratios; and analytical explorations of the numerical spacetimes to improve our understanding of strong field gravity. A second focus of the research is to study the coalescence and merger of binary systems containing a neutron star and a black hole, or two neutron stars. These are also prime scientific targets for LIGO. The investigators will include ever more realistic descriptions of the microphysics in the simulations, such as the equation of state of nuclear matter, neutrino effects,and magnetic fields.<br/><br/>This research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental physics. There are currently no real tests of general relativity in the strong field regime of black holes. For experiments like LIGO to confront theory with observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the black holes that LIGO may observe the black holes predicted by Einstein's theory? The research will have an impact on astronomy. Mergers of compact binaries containing neutron stars may lead to the emission of electromagnetic and neutrino signals, opening the possibility of concurrently observing such events in multiple ways leading to greater understanding of such events. Simulations carried out by this project will help determine what signals to look for and how to interpret them when they are detected. The research will also have an impact on the broader area of computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand."

0.410747,"This award supports the continued development, assessment, and dissemination of Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILT) and peer-instruction tools for advanced undergraduate courses. QuILTs and peer instruction tools are based upon a field-tested cognitive-apprenticeship model of learning and emphasize modeling, coaching, and scaffolding. The following features make them particularly suited for the challenging task of teaching quantum physics: (1) They are based upon research in physics education and pay particular attention to cognitive issues. (2) They consistently keep students actively engaged in the learning process by asking them to predict what should happen in a particular situation and then providing appropriate feedback. (3) They employ visualization tools to help students build physical intuition about quantum processes. (4) They attempt to bridge the gap between the abstract quantitative formalism of quantum mechanics and the qualitative understanding necessary to explain and predict diverse physical phenomena. (5) They are based on systematic investigations of difficulties students have in learning various concepts in quantum physics. (6) Many of the tools can be used in class by the instructors as supplements to lectures or outside of the class as homework or as self-study tool by students. (7) They consist of self-sufficient modular units that can be used in any order that is convenient. To aid instructors, the concept-based and problem-based QuILTs and peer-instruction tools will be keyed with most of the common textbooks."
0.375,"Searches for evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model can be addressed through direct searches at the Energy Frontier at High Energy Colliding Beam Facilities such as the LHC and through a complementary technique of indirect searches at the Intensity Frontier, in experimental measurements of very-rare decay modes of known particles. This project focuses on continued research with the NA62 experiment at CERN, which is a measurement of the rare decay of the charge K meson through the process, K+ -> pi+ nu nubar. This decay is well-predicted in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and a precision experimental measurement of the actual rate could provide evidence for new physics, if the observed rate differs significantly from the theoretical prediction. The experimental challenge is occasioned by the very small branching fraction predicted by the Standard Model for this decay mode of 0.85 x 10-10. Despite its small size, the GMU group is engaged in all aspects of NA62, with responsibilities in event trigger logic, trigger hardware and front-end electronics communication, slow controls, CEDAR (a special differential Cherenkov counter for the detection of kaons in the beam line, for which GMU has made significant contributions) and Muon Veto hardware components.<br/><br/>The George Mason group is making an impressive effort in broadening the participation in fundamental research at the intensity frontier, through its participation in QuarkNet and through a separate NSF IRES (International Research Experience for Students) grant that brings up to five undergraduates to CERN each summer, with applicants selected from a consortium of universities and colleges in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area."
0.48,"This work will focus on the inspiral and merger of compact-object binaries, one of the most interesting and powerful of multi-messenger sources. Questions to be explored include how often these sources happen, how we might detect them (both in gravitational waves and electromagnetically), and what we will learn from them. Light will be shed on the inner engines of gamma-ray bursts (among the brightest events in the Universe), including elucidating the heart of these events (are they neutron star black hole binaries?) and the processes by which they happen (are the gamma-rays beamed?). In this way, the scientific potential of gravitational-wave astrophysics will be more fully realized.<br/><br/>Gravitational waves are likely to be directly observed within the next five years, and will open an entirely new window on the Universe. We already see the Universe in optical light (e.g., with our eyes, or with the Hubble Space Telescope), in X-ray, in gamma-rays, in radio, in microwave, and across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Gravitational waves offer an entirely new way to the listen to the Universe. We've been searching for these waves for many decades, and within the next five years the LIGO instrument (based in Washington and Louisiana) will finally allow us to hear them! Fully exploiting this new window on the Universe will require multi-messenger astronomy: coordinated observations of sources in both the gravitational wave and electromagnetic spectra. This work will help develop our understanding of these multi-messenger sources. Gravitational-waves provide a natural ""hook"" into science, and are an excellent way to appeal to students of all ages. The history of gravitational waves is irresistible, with Einstein's original (and contentious) prediction finally on the verge of being directly confirmed. The waves are generated by black holes and gamma-ray bursts (representing some of the largest explosions in the Universe), and these sources are universally fascinating. The technology behind gravitational-wave detection is mind-blowing (""You can detect the surf crashing on the Oregon coast hundreds of miles away"", ""You can measure fractional changes in distance over 4 km to much smaller than the size of a proton""). The science content ranges from wave mechanics, through Newtonian gravity, interferometry, and wave optics, all the way to general relativity and quantum measurement. In short, we have a rich, timely, and fundamentally fascinating subject. We take a multi-pronged approach to share the excitement of the impending discovery of gravitational-waves, as well as to convey the science behind our research program to students and the broader public. We work directly with inner-city, minority high-school students in the South Chicago area. We are also partnering with a world-class museum, the Adler Planetarium, by presenting at the museum and helping to develop material on gravitational waves that will reach nearly half a million people a year, as well as leveraging existing educational material from LIGO. All of this will help share the excitement of a truly new way to listen to the Universe."
0.09,"The research program focuses on precision measurements of quantum-vacuum induced interactions known as the Casimir force using a high-sensitivity torsion balance. Significant emphasis will be placed on accurate quantifications of surface electric effects, thus improving experimental sensitivity to distinguish a specific model to be employed in theoretical calculation of the Casimir force. The research will address a key problem in modern precision measurements in which the presence of surface-induced interactions at metallic interfaces has become one of the biggest sources of systematic errors, as noticed in the trapping and manipulation of single-atom for quantum computing, and in precise gravitational experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). As a historically important scientific tool that has helped verify two of the fundamental forces in nature (i.e. gravitational and Coulomb forces), the torsion balance provides an excellent table-top research platform to investigate the quantum vacuum induced small forces at a predominantly undergraduate institution.<br/><br/>Intrinsic to the project is the integration of the undergraduate education with cutting-edge research. The research program will provide on-campus research opportunities for undergraduate students, enhancing an existing research program in the area of precision force measurements at Seattle University. The students will receive training in research methods for defining and addressing open-ended problems, professional ethics and conduct, and scientific reporting and communications by engaging in leading-edge research projects. The research program will expand faculty-led research opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds and is designed to lay the foundation for a long-term integrated scientific and education program in the physics department at Seattle University."
0.729942,"In this project the PI develops arguments for convergent evolution in gene networks based on simulation and bifurcation theory (or the geometric theory of differential equations). This requires defining a measure of fitness that the network optimizes and showing that mutation rates (which are unknown) to not bias the result. Darwin understood that complex organs such as the eye could evolve by continual small changes if all the intermediate steps increased the fitness. The same question will be posed for networks and answered computationally: what networks can be learned by gradient ascent (ie hill climbing). When evolution proceeds by hill climbing, the same local maxima are found irrespective of mutation rates. Generic fitness measures for embryonic patterning and the input-output response of signaling systems are suggested that may capture the phyla-wide properties of developmental networks. In situations where the network produces a static pattern, bifurcation theory enumerates the types of patterns that occur as parameters change continuously. Near the bifurcation point there are simple polynomial equations that collapse many physical variables into a few, and thus provide a description of the system with as few parameters as mathematics allows. Geometric models with fixed points, saddle points and sources may be an effective way to quantitatively model biological networks, and possibly evolution itself. A complementary experimental program will time cell divisions and other markers during embryonic development in the worm C.elegans to see if their fluctuations conform to geometric models. To see whether the structure of developmental signaling pathways can be understood from their input-output response, TGF-beta pathway in Xenopus will be probed with time and space dependent stimuli and time-lapsed imaged in sheets of embryonic cells. Students and postdocs will be engaged in research projects related to this proposal."

0.1,"Entanglement, the unique property of quantum mechanics that prevents the description of a system by just looking at the properties of its individual components, is a centerpiece in current research in diverse areas of physics spanning from quantum information science to condensed matter physics to quantum field theory. The main objective of this research is to understand the role of entanglement in the description of the quantum nature of space-time. This works investigates fundamental puzzles in theoretical physics such as the description of the primordial state of the universe and the fate of information in black hole evaporation. The focus is on universal aspects of space-time entanglement that can provide valuable insights for any theory of quantum gravity. <br/><br/>At the Planck scale new quantum effects that go beyond Einstein's general relativity are expected to dominate. Loop quantum gravity is one of the leading candidate theories for describing the physics in these regimes. In this theory, space-time has a granular structure that arises as a foam-like excitation of a topologically invariant vacuum. From this perspective, space-time is made of 'elementary constituents' and, as in condensed matter physics, it can have different quantum phases. The main open problem is to identify the quantum phase that describes our smooth extended space-time. A set of techniques that were recently developed in condensed matter physics will be used to study the amount of entanglement between quantum geometry degrees of freedom. This research will directly address the question of the quantum nature of space-time. The results of this research on entangled-network states will provide the basis for extracting physical properties of space-time states in quantum gravity. Three directions will be investigated. The first regards the Minkowski space-time state where the entangled-network state is obtained via a variational ansatz for the minimization of the ADM energy. The second direction regards the use of entangled-network states in quantum cosmology, the study of entanglement near classical singularities, and the thermalization time of subsystems in the de Sitter expansion phase. The third direction regards black hole space-times, the relation between entanglement entropy and black hole entropy, and the dynamics of entanglement entropy in the evaporation process."

Fox Accelerator Laboratory of Florida State University (FSU) and the development of a suite of state-of-the-art auxiliary detectors around it. This instrument will allow precision measurements of certain nuclear properties, which determine the energy release and time scale of stellar explosions and studies of the physics of unbound atomic nuclei in general. This instrument reclaims the capability to perform such precision measurements in the USA. <br/><br/>This collaborative MRI award will fund the installation of a large-acceptance, high-resolution Enge split-pole spectrograph (SPS) at the accelerator laboratory at FSU with the purpose of studying the physics of resonant nuclear states that impact nuclear astrophysics and nuclear structure. The SPS became available upon the cessation of operations at the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University. This project will install the 32-tonne instrument at FSU and augment its research capabilities by upgrading its focal plane detectors and developing a new Silicon detector array, in parallel at Louisiana State University (LSU), for efficient spectroscopy of unbound resonances.<br/><br/>The properties of un-bound nuclear states, or resonances, have become a focal point of present day nuclear science as they present the doorway through which stars and stellar explosions build up the elements and release energy. The LSU/FSU collaboration previously developed the Array for Nuclear Astrophysics and Structure with Exotic Beams (ANASEN) for high-efficiency studies of such reactions using beams of radioactive nuclei. A new opportunity for advancing our understanding of nuclear reactions with astrophysical importance stems from the unique combination of high-precision spectroscopy performed with the SPS with the existing program of high-sensitivity studies with radioactive beams currently being performed with ANASEN.<br/><br/>The proposed SPS system also creates an important discovery potential for the physics of exotic nuclear states, studied through a systematic investigation of particle orbitals beyond the binding limit. The interaction of nuclear orbits across shell closures is of importance to the physics of exotic nuclei at the limits of binding. The modification of nuclear properties through the presence of extended wavefunctions will be studied through a detailed spectroscopy of un-bound resonances, studying the presence of the Super-radiance mechanism in the presence of competing particle-decay channels. Again, the research at the SPS is not only complementary, but important to current and future studies with radioactive beams at FSU and the future Facility for Rare isotope Beams (FRIB).<br/><br/>The proposed program around the SPS is a complementary effort and aims to address a lack of experimental opportunities with stable nuclear beams within the U.S. scientific program. Operated by a collaboration of two vibrant research groups, the SPS has the potential to become a national resource in the education of the next generation of scientists."
0.459453,"Broad significance. <br/>Positronium is an exotic matter-antimatter atom composed of an electron bound to its antiparticle, the positron. Scientists at the University of California Riverside will develop a new type of instrument that will measure the particles of light (photons) that are emitted by the positronium. The instrument (spectrometer) will have capabilities beyond those commercially available and will allow scientists to measure the temperature of large bursts of positronium atoms as a function of time. The new spectrometer will be the enabling technology leading to the production and observation of a dense gas of cold positronium in the ""Bose-Einstein condensed state"". This unusual state of matter will be a concentrated energy source which may lead to a variety of applications, including a new type of laser. The spectrometer will be used in a variety of applications in collaboration with scientists from around the world who need to measure radiation damage on short times scales, obtain information about the structure of materials, and measure the densities and temperatures of plasmas. <br/><br/>Technical description. <br/>The proposed instrument is a high angular resolution, multi-detector two-gamma annihilation angular correlation spectrometer that will measure the velocity distribution of positronium atoms annihilating in the singlet state. The individual detectors will have time and double-pulse resolutions much less than the ~100 ns annihilation lifetime of positronium, enabling the efficient measurement of the temperature and thermalization rates of large bursts of positronium atoms as a function of time after their formation in micro-cavities and porous materials. The primary function of the proposed instrument will be to measure the amplitude of the low momentum component of a dense positronium gas as it undergoes a phase transition into the Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) state. The use of the penetrating annihilation gamma radiation as a diagnostic allows external access to the momentum profiles of annihilating electron-positron pairs deep within the apparatus required for these experiments. The measurements will be unaffected by local conditions in the positronium-forming target, such as wall or inter-particle interactions, which would not be the case for optical spectroscopy. The combined capabilities of the proposed spectrometer will benefit other positronium applications using dense cold positronium not related to the BEC. In particular, measuring the thermalization rates of positronium would aid in the positronium characterization of porous materials such as zeolites and low-k dielectrics, and the ability to measure low momentum annihilations at short time scales may be useful for evaluating damage to materials used in fusion reactors."
0.375,"This award, an Industry-University Collaborative Project between the University of Wisconsin-Madison and scientists and engineers at Northrop-Grumman Corporation, demonstrates a new type of nuclear magnetic resonance using noble-gas nuclei. The essential innovation is to use an integrated atomic magnetometer to get the best signal-to-noise ratio, while greatly suppressing potential errors introduced by the magnetometer. The resonator is of fundamental interest for searches for spin-dependent symmetry violation tests, and of practical interest in improving the state-of-the-art in NMR gyroscopes. The key to the new approach is the concept of synchronous spin-exchange optical pumping, wherein the magnetometer atoms and the nuclei are made to precess at the same frequency. Estimates of technical noise indicate the system has a potential frequency noise level of better than 1 nHz/ Hz, with fundamental limits that are much better. The oscillator will be used to set new stringent limits on the potential couplings of potential dark matter candidates to nuclei. The resonator will also be evaluated for use as a precision NMR gyro. While the developments here represent a substantially new approach to NMR oscillators, the Industry-University collaboration will allow industrial expertise with conventional NMR oscillator technology to be leveraged for accelerated development.<br/><br/>In addition to the normal academic research training of undergraduate and graduate students, the project provides substantive exposure of students to industrial scientists and engineers working in an R&D environment. Students benefit from industrial expertise in areas such as electronics, magnetic field, and thermal design. The work being pursued has both fundamental and practical applications and the nuclear magnetic resonator will be evaluated in particular for potential applications to navigation"

0.197647,"This award supports a project to investigate the development of undergraduate students' mathematical understanding in the context of learning physics, particularly while solving challenging upper-division physics problems. The project team will conduct an integrated program of research, curriculum development, and assessment of topics covering a typical sophomore- or junior-level course in mathematical methods. The broad goals are to conduct research on student resources, study the process of transfer from mathematics to physics and the coevolution of knowledge in the two disciplines, and develop a set of Math / Physics tasks suitable for instruction, research, and assessment materials that will integrate challenging math content with topics covered in upper-division physics core courses. This project has the potential to impact a gateway course to the upper division for physics majors. Curricular materials will be shared through electronic clearinghouses and via published research and it is anticipated that the project will inform instruction - both of math methods courses and subsequent physics courses in which the mathematics is used - nationally and internationally. The student population at California State University Fullerton includes many students from groups traditionally underrepresented in physics, so this project will provide access to research-based materials for these students and also ensure a diverse research population. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project brings together physics education research (PER) and research in undergraduate math education (RUME). It blends efforts at identifying and addressing student conceptual difficulties in physics with efforts toward understanding knowledge transfer in mathematics. The work targets a key course for physics majors, the mathematical methods course that is offered in most departments at the sophomore- or junior-level. This course is typically intended to be a bridge between introductory physics and calculus courses and the more challenging mathematics and physics encountered by students in the core courses of electricity and magnetism, classical mechanics, and modern physics / quantum mechanics. The project will strengthen the research base in a portion of the curriculum that has, to this point, largely gone unexamined, and will touch upon, and build upon, work in several related areas, including PER in other upper-division courses as well as the extensive research base in undergraduate mathematics education. This proposed work will provide significant insights into transfer by probing the extent to which the nature of student understanding depends upon the disciplinary context. The research team has many years' experience in PER and RUME and have collaborated on successful research and curriculum development projects at the upper division in thermal physics and the physics-mathematics interface."

However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions, for example why there is a preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to such open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are elementary particles that barely interact with anything else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they would undergo whenever they would interact with matter. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino measurements, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. There have also been possible hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos (called sterile neutrinos), and building the critical instruments to clarify such ""hints"" is one of the main thrusts of the work in this project.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The work proposed here is to develop a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC) for the LAr1-ND Experiment. This detector technique is powerful in that it allows the experimenter to distinguish between electrons and photons, important for the understanding of the character of neutrino interactions and neutrino oscillations. At Fermilab, the LAr1-ND experiment, along with a companion experiment called MicroBooNE, should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether hypothesized ""sterile"" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: This research program will serve as an invaluable proving ground for LAr TPC technology and in the reconstruction and analysis techniques that will be needed to make future experiments a success. The construction effort at the three collaborating institutions Yale, Syracuse and Chicago will enable students and postdocs at each institution to participate and acquire invaluable hands-on experience with advanced detector technology that is a vital component of training scientists in the field of high-energy physics."
0.3969,"This is a MRI development award to the particle physics group at Syracuse University to design and build the central core of the Upgrade Tracker (the UT) for the LHCb Experiment, located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. LHCb is currently the premier dedicated experiment for the study of hadronic production of heavy quark systems containing charm and beauty quarks. The UT is a silicon tracking detector, and the Syracuse group has key expertise to develop and deliver this important instrumentation to the experiment, including fundamental knowledge of the underlying physics, devices, metrology, simulations, and implementation. The scientific focus of the Syracuse group is directed toward the study of B decays, Charm decays, and study of CP violation processes which are related to and potentially important for the understanding of the matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe. The proposed UT will enable LHCb to study these very rare processes effectively and to fully exploit the increased luminosity planned for LHC operations at collision energies up to 14 TeV and collision intervals of 25 nsec. The broader impacts of the program are significant for the training of young research scientists in instrumentation development and will greatly enhance their training and exposure to state of the art hardware and electronics systems."
0.471,"The Nuclear Science Laboratory (NSL) at the University of Notre Dame (ND) operates a world-renowned scientific program in nuclear astrophysics, nuclear structure and radioactive beam physics, as well as in nuclear physics applications, radiation chemistry, and material analysis. A very successful Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) program dedicated to nuclear astrophysics, aimed at complementing the existing laboratory measurement and detection techniques, and based on the FN accelerator was added in 2003. This MRI will allow the lab to modify the low energy injection system of the tandem to provide the high mass resolution necessary for improved isotopic selectivity. The modified system will extend measurement capabilities and expand the broad portfolio of available accelerated beams, making the NSL a unique and world-leading facility for both the development of new highly sensitive detection techniques and for the measurements of isotopic ratios not yet possible. <br/><br/>The MRI will provide the Notre Dame AMS facility with the capability of measuring radioactive probes and developing innovative AMS detection techniques that only two other facilities worldwide (Technische Universität München - Munich) and Australian National University - Canberra) can also provide due to the combination of available energies, detection techniques and scope of scientific program. The radioactive probes allow us to better understand current supernovae models and stellar nucleosynthesis, and provide evidence of injection of freshly synthesized material into the proto solar system as well as by possible nearby supernova events in the more recent past. In order to exploit these long-lived probes new innovative detection techniques have been developed. <br/><br/>The new injection system will also greatly enhance our efforts in applied techniques that have recently received considerable interest both locally and nationally, resulting in new collaborations with the art world and the art history community to provide state-of-the-art identification of artifacts. This program introduces non-physics faculty to the benefit of new analytical methods in fields as diverse as anthropology, archaeology and art history and attracts their students into the NSL to take advantage of new research opportunities. The improved AMS sensitivity also opens the door to a number of exciting programs to use radioactive tracers to probe the history of early Earth as well as a number of important paleoclimatic and geological records."
0.867111,"This collaborative award to the University of Washington and Cornell University funds the development of a calorimeter detector that would be used to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This quantity is of fundamental interest because of discrepancies between a recent measurement and theoretical predictions of the standard model of particle physics. The magnetic moment of the muon will be measured with greatly increased precision. If the discrepancy is confirmed, it would imply the existence of new subatomic particles, so far undetected, and would fundamentally reshape our understanding of the world around us."

In alignment with INSPIRE program objectives, this is a high risk, multidisciplinary effort including particle physics, R. Rusack, condensed matter physics, J. Kakalios and materials engineering, U. Kortshagen. The program objectives include: the identification, fabrication and testing of at least one suitable amorphous/nanocrystalline Si material with excellent performance characteristics for charge mobility, recombination rate and robustness to radiation damage; the development of processing conditions for these identified material(s) that allow production of a reasonable detector size and thickness on a practical timescale per device; and technology transfer to industry to produce the materials at scale suitable for detector applications. <br/><br/>In the first phase of the program, the group will utilize an existing dual reactor co-deposition system to produce and study a number of amorphous/nanocrystal silicon films to determine the nanocrystal size and density that will optimize mobility and recombination lifetime. Irradiation studies will factor into this optimization. In parallel with these studies, a new, replacement reactor system with a translatable substrate stage will be designed and fabricated. In the final phase and with the new reactor system, the group's objective is to demonstrate a functioning new co-deposition system for mixed phase growth over a reasonable area, from which larger scale industrial processing could be based.<br/><br/>Development of such scalable nano-manufacturing technologies could enable mixed-phase amorphous/nanocrystalline materials to find a broad range of applications. In addition to the development of innovative new particle detector materials and technologies, novel mixed-phase materials might lead to other important applications, for example potential advances in high efficiency photovoltaic devices, non-volatile memories, materials for medical x-ray imaging, thermo-electrics and electroluminescent devices."
0.592413,"This international travel award to Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) provides support that will enable a diverse group of approximately twenty-five U.S. graduate students to attend the annual meeting of Nobel Laureates in Lindau, Germany. Since 1951, Nobel Prize winners and students in chemistry, physics, and physiology or medicine have met annually in Lindau, Germany. Each year an international group of some 600 students is invited to attend the weeklong meeting. The program includes formal lectures in the mornings and the remainder of each day is set aside for the students to meet informally with the Nobel Laureate scientists, as well as with their fellow students from around the world. The programmatic cycle revolves among the three Nobel themes noted above, followed by a multidisciplinary theme every fourth year that embraces all three of these Nobel focus areas. Together with another approximately thirty-five-member cohort supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, (DOE), the National institutes of Health (NIH), ORAU, and private foundations, this grant brings to seventy the number of graduate students in the U.S. delegation that will participate in these meetings. The objective of this program is to motivate participating U.S. students toward excellence in their chosen careers through their exposure to and interaction with Nobel Laureates and fellow students from around the world. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this international travel activity and NSF support of it by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and include the likely synergistic impact on the participating students' scientific career development, the potential for initiating career-long international scientific interactions, and the opportunity to promote diversity at multiple levels among the student participants."
0.285,"This award funds theoretical research in several different topics in relativistic astrophysics and general relativity, with a focus on tests of general relativity and on sources of gravitational radiation that might be detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and by future space based detectors. Theoretical studies of sources of gravitational waves funded by this award will be useful to aid detection of signals from black holes and other sources, and also to aid in their interpretation. Gravitational wave studies can tell us about the nature of gravity, properties of black holes, and properties of the early Universe.<br/><br/>In more detail, this principal research topics of this award are: (i) The development of methods to compute the gravitational waveforms from point particles inspiralling into spinning black holes, using a combination of analytical and numerical approaches; (ii) The computation of the effects of radiation reaction on the gravitational wave signals from cosmic strings, which may have been produced in the early Universe; and (iii) The exploration of an explanation of angular momentum ambiguity in general relativity in terms of the gravitational wave memory effect, using approximation methods that have been developed for asymptotically flat spacetimes."
0.548546,"This award funds the continued operations and further development of Einstein@Home and its software infrastructure, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). Einstein@Home is one of the largest and most powerful computers on the planet. It searches astrophysical data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars. Unlike a normal supercomputer, the computing power of Einstein@Home comes from ordinary home computers and laptops that have been ""signed up"" by about 300,000 members of the general public. When otherwise idle, these computers automatically download observational data over the Internet from Einstein@Home servers, search the data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars, and return the results of the analysis to the servers.<br/><br/>Neutron stars are exotic objects: they represent the most compact form that a star can take before it collapses into a black hole. Since they were discovered in 1967, about two thousand neutron stars have been found (including several discovered in 2010 and 2011 by Einstein@Home). Neutron star observations provide a unique view into the behavior of matter at extreme pressures and densities, and into the nature of gravitation when gravity is very strong. Under certain circumstances, neutron stars can be emitters of pulsing radio waves (pulsars). Einstein@home exploits the unique capabilities of the Arecibo Radio Observatory, the largest and most sensitive single-dish radio telescope in the world, to search for these signals. It is possible that neutron stars can also emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein in 1917 but have never been directly detected. Einstein@home can search the data from gravitational wave detectors such as those of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) for these signals. Einstein@home also supports the BOINC software infrastructure to benefit dozens of computationally intensive projects in other areas of science, that also exploit volunteer distributed computing. And it is a remarkable tool for scientific outreach: Einstein@Home allows hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens from around the world to participate in and make meaningful contribution to cutting-edge scientific research."
