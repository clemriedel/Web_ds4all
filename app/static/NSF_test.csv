595000,"This research will advance our understanding the relationship between infectious disease and social behavior. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a deadly fungal pathogen has caused the extinction of many amphibian species. This research will examine how amphibian social behavior spreads this potentially fatal pathogen by studying the communally nesting of slender salamanders (genus Batrachoseps), this salamander is the most common vertebrate in California and recent evidence shows that many populations are infected by the fungal pathogen Bd.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The investigators will test the hypothesis that sociality increases Bd transmission by measuring levels of communal nesting and comparing this with the frequency and degree of infection. The researchers will also test the hypothesis that longer histories of pathogen exposure lead to the evolutionary loss of social behavior by reconstructing each population's history of Bd infection from museum specimens. Understanding this link between amphibian social behavior and infectious disease will have important implications for the conservation of endangered amphibians, and may provide insights into the spread of human disease.<br/><br/>Broader impacts. San Francisco State University is a large, comprehensive public university, where 35% of the enrolled undergraduates are under-represented minorities or from groups under-represented in the sciences. This project will provide these students with a strong foundation as well as the practical tools and critical thinking skills that will ready them for life-long learning and mastering the challenges awaiting them in graduate school and the workforce. These students will work to include behavioral data in the publically-accessible AmphibiaWeb database, (http://amphibiaweb.org/), which receives more than 20,000 queries per day. AmhibiaWeb will be used to disseminate the research findings from this project to both the scientific community and the public, in addition to the publications and presentations that will be jointly authored by the PIs and their students."
580860,"Personal odors can play an essential role in communication and individual recognition. Scents make be influenced by genes that are critical for immune function, including genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This study will marry chemical ecology with modern forensic science techniques establishing the Leach's storm-petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa), as a model system studying what appears to be a critical but little studied aspect of social interactions in birds.This long-lived, burrow-nesting species has an excellent sense of smell, making them an ideal model for this investigation. Extensive field study sites have already been established on Bon Portage Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, where over 300 breeding pairs have been genotyped for the MHC class 2B gene. The aim is to characterize the individual odor profiles of these genotyped birds using state-of-the-art chemical techniques developed for human scent discrimination. Specific research objectives are a) to test whether individual birds produce odor signatures related to their MHC-genotype, b) to determine if birds use MHC-related scent marks to label their home burrows, and c) to determine whether the scent of an individual bird is an indicator of individual quality, health and fitness, or plays a role in mate choice decisions. Showing that any species of bird uses MHC-related odors in mate choice decisions would represent a paradigm shift in how biologists think about mate choice decisions in birds, and will provide insights relevant to avian immunology and health in a wide-ranging species. Just as importantly, many species of petrels and albatrosses are facing extinction, and understanding the factors driving mate choice and colony demographics will make a valuable contribution to comprehensive management plans for endangered species. Published phenotypic/chemical or genetic data will be deposited in the Dryad Repository (http://datadryad.org/) or submitted to Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), and deposited in Merritt Data Repository (http://www.dataone.org/software-tools/merritt-repository-service)."
924163,"This research will address how genetic, taxonomic, ecological, and landscape diversity affect the natural control of agricultural pests by predators. The study will focus on three crops (corn, alfalfa, and soybean) and the group of aphid species that attacks them. Aphids are normally kept in check by roughly 20 common predators. Because these predators move frequently among fields and other habitats, their ability to suppress aphids depends upon the diversity of the landscape. Furthermore, aphids contain bacterial symbionts that give their insect hosts tolerance to high temperatures. These symbionts thus make it possible for aphids to evolve in response to global warming. The proposed research will use remote sensing, field experiments, and genetic assays to understand the roles of ecology and evolution in maintaining the natural control of aphid pests.<br/><br/>Corn, alfalfa, and soybean dominate the agricultural landscape of much of the USA, and predators naturally suppress many potential agricultural pests. A changing climate, or another anthropogenic environmental change, could break down this natural control, leading to greater pest problems for US agriculture. Understanding how ecological and evolutionary diversity confers resilience against environmental changes could improve understanding of warning signs of potential pest problems, and also provide possible solutions. The research will not only address this scientific challenge but will also educate the public by enlisting the help of citizen scientists who will sample aphids and predators across the USA, bringing hands-on science into citizen's backyards."
515500,"Animals communicate with each other using specific behaviors that are controlled by the interaction of muscles, hormones, and the central nervous system. However, it is not yet known whether species that exhibit the same patterns of behavior have similar muscular, hormonal, and neural traits (collectively referred to as mechanisms of behavior), or if different combinations of these traits can produce the same behaviors. This project uses a group of 26 lizard species in the genus Anolis to determine the mechanisms that underlie two social behaviors: communication with other lizards through the extension of a throat fan, and copulation. Because these behaviors are simple, but can be directly compared across multiple species, this study allows a clear and comprehensive assessment of the interactions between the neuromuscular traits that control behavior in all vertebrates. This study is comprised of two components, both of which aim to determine the evolutionary relationships between social behaviors and their mechanisms. First, by combining detailed observations of the animals' natural behavior with biochemical assays that measure the neuromuscular traits of the animals, this project will determine if species that live in similar habitats have similar behaviors and their underlying mechanisms, and if species in different habitats exhibit different behaviors and behavioral mechanisms. Next, a laboratory experiment will manipulate rates of social behavior in males of four species by altering their levels of testosterone. This experiment will determine whether hormone-enhanced behaviors are associated with the same combination of neuromuscular traits across species. Overall, this project will provide intensive, hands-on research experiences for 12 undergraduate students, and will form the basis of a program for fifth grade science teachers and their students in urban public schools in San Antonio. These efforts will focus on providing accessible training in the science of behavior and physiology to a diverse community.<br/><br/>Data will be made available: EthoBank (http://www.indiana.edu/~ethobank/index.html) and lizardbase(http://lizardbase.org/pages/index.html)"
547000,"One of the most complex examples of symbiosis in nature is the precise manipulation of animal behavior by a microbe. Ophiocordyceps is a fungus that infects zombie ants. Infection of ant workers by thousands of these fungal cells causes the workers to leave the colony and die attached by their mandibles to plants that overhang the trails of ant colonies. There the fungus uses the dead ant bodies to produce spores that infect other ants. The manipulation is complex and spectacular given the fact that an organism without a brain controls the behavior of one with a brain. In this project the research team will use an integrative approach to ask how fungi change ants from being productive members of their colony to ""fungi in ant's clothing?"". The project will use measurement of gene expression, metabolism and tissue structure to ask how, during the 3 week period of infection, the fungi effectively take control of the ant. This work will provide many general insights into the nature of parasitism and may have broader societal relevance because these fungi are known to be important sources of small molecules with medical relevance. The work is relevant to the broader mission of NSF to increase scientific literacy as the zombie ant system has been shown to be a very useful tool for communicating the elegance and beauty of natural systems. <br/><br/>How can a microbe control the central nervous system of an animal? Animals are intimately associated with microbes that span the symbiotic spectrum from mutualism to parasitism. In some cases, microbial parasites of animals have evolved to control animal behavior in ways that enhance parasite transmission. The zombie ants represent one prominent example. In this system a fungal parasite (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis) has evolved a precise level of behavioral control over the ants it infects. Worker ants infected by O. unilateralis move out from their colonies at precise times of day to highly specific locations on leaves in forests, where they bite into vegetation before dying. This altered behavior provides a platform for the eventual release of spores from a long fungal stalk that grows from the cadaver of the ant. This striking system involves an organism in one kingdom of life (Fungi) that controls the behavior of an organism in another (Animalia). How does an organism without a brain control the behavior of one with a brain? The investigators will address this using time series infectionstudies to measure chemical changes in both the parasite and its host. By using three different but complementary tools (serial block face scanning electron microscopy, metabolomics and transcriptomics) to examine these changes across time, the investigators hope to understand the basis of these behavioral changes."
910000,"Young animals must often leave their birthplace and search for a new home before producing their own offspring; such movement between natal and breeding locations is known as natal dispersal. Dispersal behavior underlies many ecological processes. For example, individual movement across the landscape during dispersal provides crucial ecological connectivity in natural populations. However, extraordinarily little is known about how young animals navigate the complex social and ecological environments they encounter during dispersal. This project will use the brush mouse (Peromyscus boylii) as a model system to answer the following questions: 1) How do pre-existing behavioral differences among individuals influence dispersal movements? 2) How do social interactions with resident adults affect the behavior of juveniles as they move through the landscape? 3) How are survival and reproductive success affected by the interplay of socioecological conditions and individual dispersal strategies? This project will utilize a new automated animal tracking system, social network approaches, and genetic tools to develop a more complete understanding of dispersal dynamics in a natural population of brush mice. <br/><br/>This project includes multiple opportunities for training and outreach. Through a multi-institution undergraduate course, students will collaborate across campuses using a wilderness wireless network and social media to coordinate field research projects, collect data, and communicate their experiences to a wider audience. Outreach activities introducing elementary school students to the tracking technology employed in the field research will be developed and distributed. Education and outreach activities will be integrated online: a research blog written by project participants will document the movements of radiotracked animals, social networking sites will allow course participants to communicate their experiences from the field, and outreach activities based on field research methods and data will be made freely available online."
673000,"Animals at high altitudes use a variety of mechanisms to acquire sufficient oxygen despite low atmospheric pressure. Individual animals can shift their respiratory strategies in real time, just as humans increase the concentration and size of red blood cells during high-altitude training. Alternatively, high-altitude populations can genetically adapt by natural selection over generations, effectively optimizing their respiratory systems for low ambient oxygen pressure. This project will characterize the high-altitude respiratory strategies of dozens of wild bird species. Study taxa comprise pairs of related high-altitude and low-altitude populations at different levels of evolutionary divergence. International teams will sample birds along elevational gradients in the Andes to evaluate the structure and performance of critical respiratory system components, including heart, lungs, blood, hemoglobin, and the hypoxia-induced gene-expression cascade. With these data, this project will (1) develop a model of the time-course of high-altitude adaptation and (2) describe the diversity of solutions to this common physiological challenge. This new model and comparative data will facilitate inference of biogeographic history through integration of physiological and phylogenetic information. The results will reveal the contribution of respiratory specialization to the uniqueness and diversity of the Andean avifauna.<br/><br/>American and Peruvian students will develop international partnerships during the project's research expeditions. Specimens and linked data will be archived in museum collections and online databases. Andean bird lineages provide analogues to high-altitude human populations and their hypoxia defense mechanisms are of broad interest due to the profound role of hypoxia in human pathology."
559727,"Project description: Positive assortative mating occurs when individuals select mates who are more similar to themselves than expected by chance. A recent analysis of more than 1,000 case studies found that positive assortative mating is the rule rather than the exception within human and non-human animals. Positive assortative mating maintains genetic variation in populations, biases genetic mapping studies (e.g., to find disease-causing genes), and may drive the origin of new species. In light of the important genetic effects of assortative mating, it is surprising that little is known about its behavioral and evolutionary causes. The investigator will conduct experiments to test competing hypotheses as to why positive mating evolves. Specifically this study will (1) evaluate the frequency and strength of assortative mating within 20 populations of an important model organism (the threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus), (2) identify the mate-choice behaviors that generate assortment, and (3) test whether assortment is favored by direct versus indirect selection, and/or disfavored by costs or barriers to signal transmission. Notably, this work provides the first field-based empirical test of the long-standing theory that disruptive natural selection favors positive assortative mating. This hypothesis, if true, would change our view about how new species arise.<br/><br/>Broader significance: The project will improve our understanding of the causes and incidence of assortative mating. By focusing attention on this form of non-random mating, the work will increase awareness of the high frequency of assortment and therefore the need to account for non-random mating in genetic and association mapping studies in both evolutionary biology and medicine. In addition, the project will pair scientists with high-school biology teachers and pre-service teachers-in-training. This will give K-12 science teachers practical experience in biological research, and foster communication between scientists and current and future teachers."
639217,"The tallgrass prairie of North America is an iconic landscape, central to America history. The grasses from which the prairie takes its name are close relatives of those that make up the vast grasslands of eastern Africa. The grasses provide food for livestock and wild animals, and habitat for birds; they also pull carbon from the atmosphere and bury it deep in the ground where it supports beneficial microbes that make the rich soil on which American agriculture depends. This project is a collaboration between research scientists at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri, undergraduates at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, and colleagues in eastern Africa, and is aimed at unraveling the ways the grasses spread their pollen, how they provide their seeds with carbon, and how the seeds are dispersed across the landscape. This information will tell us how the grasslands will respond in the face of current disturbance such as fire, urbanization, and conversion to farmland, and future disturbances caused by a changing climate. <br/><br/><br/>This project focuses on three major grass genera, Andropogon, Schizachyrium, and Hyparrhenia, plus a few smaller related genera, that together include some 250 species many of which are ecological dominants. Researchers will first use DNA sequences to uncover the phylogenetic history of the group, and then use that history to trace how the seed-bearing portions of the plant have changed over evolutionary time and how they correlate with climate, fire, and moisture. The seeds in these plants do not simply drop off the plant. Instead they are released as part of a complex dispersal structure that includes pieces of floral stalks and leaf-like bracts. The dispersal structure varies between species in size, presence or absence of hairs, presence of male and female flowers, and presence or absence of awns (hygroscopic extensions of bracts). The structure may be an adaptation for seed dispersal, for the control of germination in particular soil types, or for resistance to fire. However, the same structures may also help with pollination. In addition, many parts of the dispersal structure are green during development, and may provide photosynthate for the developing seed. Thus the structure could be selected for functions at three different life history stages: pollination, grain filling, and dispersal. This project will use both a historical phylogenetic approach and an experimental approach to test the current function of the dispersal structure. The dispersal structure studied here is much like that of sorghum, sugarcane and Miscanthus, so the data will apply to those crops as well as to the major grassland species."
783697,"This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Ecosystem Studies Program in the Division of Environmental Biology in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Environmental Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems in the Directorate for Engineering.<br/><br/>Microbes are critical, but often ignored, players in all ecosystems. They have tremendous influence on ecosystem resilience, with implications for predicting the response and feedback to drivers ranging from climate change to land-use change and management. However, it has been challenging to incorporate microbes and their vast diversity into predictive environmental models. Specifically, key advances are needed to address the knowledge gaps that prevent integration of microbial genomic information into ecosystem-scale science. Solutions will be highly interdisciplinary, with contributions from microbiologists, ecologists, computational biologists, and engineers. This project aims to use genomic data to determine how microbes in freshwater lakes control carbon cycling and water quality, and to convert this new understanding into predictive computational models that forecast how lakes will behave. Environmental engineers have a long history of working quantitatively with water quality models, but they do not incorporate microbes into them. Ecosystem scientists study the flux of matter and energy through ecosystems but they rarely consider microbes and often do not construct models based on first principles. This work will bring together three disciplines that are rarely integrated: microbiology, ecosystem science, and environmental engineering.<br/><br/>This work will have broad impacts on science as well as education and outreach efforts. Microbial biologists and ecologists are hungry for new ways to transform complex datasets and fundamental concepts into understanding and prediction. Students and post-docs in fields of microbiology, ecology, and engineering need cross-training in computational biology, genomics, and modeling. They will need to push their science to be less descriptive and more predictive, which requires computational and integrative thinking that transcends the structure of current graduate programs in these disciplines. The project will leverage relevant network science initiatives such as the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) and the nascent Genomic Observatories (GOs) network. Finally, our ability to make microbial ecosystem science relevant to the broader public depends on illustrating how tiny entities can have large impact on high-value ecosystems services. Freshwater lakes are excellent systems for this purpose since water quality is so tightly linked to microbes, with major feedbacks to local economic activity, ecosystem management decisions, and public perception of ecosystem health."
955001,"Research has recently shown that overgrazing of livestock in a grassland in China lowered the nitrogen content of the grasses and that this caused a rise in the abundance of a locust likely to lead to locust swarms. This proposal will test whether this is also true for related species of locust in Australia and western Africa, and link both grazing practices and locust swarms to economics and social policy in the three contrasting regions. Three biologists and three social scientists will team up to help answer: (1) How do insect-nutrient relations and livestock grazing strategies interact to affect food prices, food security, and rangeland degradation? (2) How do property rights regimes affect the adaptive capacity of societies to respond to the link between overgrazing and locust outbreaks? Because both market forces and locust swarms operate over long distances, these effects are likely to be global. <br/><br/>Locust outbreaks have had devastating effects on food security, impacting crop and livestock yields. This proposal aims to develop new, sustainable strategies to understand and manage locust outbreaks, accounting for feedbacks among ecological, agricultural, and economic systems. Results will be translated directly into management and policy recommendations through collaborations with agricultural agencies. The project will also strengthen international scientific collaboration, train undergraduate and graduate students, and develop a multi-media outreach program for K-12 students and teachers."
540000,"There are large differences in cognitive abilities and brain morphology both within and between species, yet it remains unclear why such differences exist. Such differences may result from differential biological fitness associated with individual variation in cognitive abilities, yet empirical evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Different tasks require different cognitive abilities (e.g. spatial memory vs. memory for color), yet whether natural selection can shape different cognitive abilities independently is also debated. <br/><br/>The proposed research will address these two major questions by (1) comparing individual differences in two cognitive abilities (spatial learning and non-spatial learning in wild food-caching mountain chickadees in two environments that place different demands on just one of these abilities, spatial memory, which is involved in recovering thousands of previously made food caches and (2) measuring biological fitness associated with individual differences in both cognitive abilities. If natural selection can affect these abilities independently, only differences in spatial learning ability should be associated with differential biological fitness. <br/><br/>In addition to addressing major evolutionary questions about population/species differences in cognitive abilities, the proposed study will also have significant implications for learning and memory research. It is still generally assumed that the mechanisms underlying associative learning in general are the same for all types of learning and memory and so studying one type of memory allows development of treatments for all memory types. Demonstrating that natural selection can affect different cognitive abilities independently would suggest that we must consider specific cognitive abilities and their regulatory mechanisms individually when designing interventions. The proposed research will also increase research readiness and science literacy by providing intensive research training to undergraduate and graduate students as well as outreach to K-12 students and the general public through the Sagehen Biological Station."
648067,"Many insects, including pests of agricultural and medical importance, bear symbiotic bacteria that provide essential nutrients to their insect hosts, but the composition and amount of nutrients transferred between the partners are largely unknown. This project will investigate insect-bacterial nutrient exchange in insects that feed on the extremely nutrient-poor diet of plant xylem sap. Exploiting recent advances in genomics and metabolic modeling, the investigators will quantify the capacity of both insect and bacteria to synthesize key nutrients, and then integrate these results in the form of metabolic models that describe the amount of each nutrient transferred between the partners. These models enable testing of two fundamental predictions: that nutrients produced in excess by one partner are required by other partners, achieving the nutritional efficiency that is required for insects to survive on xylem sap; and that the profile of nutrients received by the insects from their bacterial partners is defined by the overall metabolic network, and not simply the gene content of the bacteria. The integrated molecular understanding of the nutritional interactions between the insects and bacteria generated by this research will identify specific targets for novel pest control strategies against important xylem-feeding insect pests which transmit plant pathogens affecting citrus, grape, coffee and other crops. The project will provide training in state-of-the-art genomic and modeling methods for a postdoctoral researcher and graduate and undergraduate students. To address the increasingly recognized gap between research infrastructure and educational resources in sequence analysis and bioinformatics, the investigators will provide hands-on experience in genomics to students from local higher education institutions with limited genomics educational resources, and also develop lesson plans for genomics/ bioinformatics education in schools."
515704,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Bacteria have an amazing diversity of pathways for generating the energy they need to live and function. This diversity contributes to their ability to thrive in and impact different environments. Despite this importance, our knowledge of how the metabolic potential of bacteria influences ocean ecosystem function is far from complete. The main research goal of this project is to understand how the function of alternative oxidase (AOX) physiologically benefits microorganisms. AOX is a component of energy generation pathways of certain marine bacteria which are numerically dominant and/or important for chemical cycling in ocean environments. Due to the fundamental connection between energy generation and bacterial growth and survival, AOX could ultimately be linked to the contribution of these bacteria to the functioning of the ocean ecosystem.Towards this research goal, the genetically manipulable marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri will be used as a model organism in genetic, molecular, and biochemical assays. These assays will test hypotheses that AOX functions to reduce oxidative stress and DNA damage, maintain metabolic balance, and/or reduce oxygen tensions under various growth conditions. The results of these studies will provide important new information related to the benefit of AOX function in bacteria, and lay the foundation for exploration of the role of AOX in the physiology of other marine bacteria and the influence of bacterial AOX on marine ecosystem function. In addition, these studies may contribute to understanding the evolutionary history of this interesting protein.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This research project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by providing opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and a postdoctoralresearcher to actively participate in the research activities. These students and researcher will be encouraged to interact with the scientific community by attending and presenting at regional, national, and international meetings. In addition, outreach seminars discussing the research will be presented at regional colleges and universities with the goal of developing relationships with faculty and students at non-PhD granting institutions to encourage talented undergraduates to consider graduate studies. Finally, scientific outreach to the general public will be accomplished through participation in the Norman Science Café, a venue that promotes informal and conversational interactions between scientists and people without formal scientific training."
675000,"Tropical dry forests have unique biodiversity and high potential for carbon sequestration, but they have been greatly reduced in area by deforestation. In countries such as Costa Rica, dry forests are now regenerating following centuries of grazing. The goal of this project is to determine how tropical dry forest carbon dynamics (i.e. processes like photosynthesis that add carbon to the ecosystem or decomposition that remove it) depend upon plant characteristics, disturbance history, and environmental factors. The methods include experimental studies of seedling growth and traits, observations of forest-level carbon dynamics in plots that vary in soils and forest age, and computer modeling of carbon dynamics.<br/><br/>Results of these studies will: 1) provide benchmark, long-term datasets of carbon dynamics in dry forests, and 2) by extrapolating to coarser spatial and temporal scales, forecast how tropical dry forests worldwide may respond to changes in climate and land use. Educational activities include training advanced undergraduate students in tropical ecology through a field course, increasing ecological literacy by development of active learning materials for undergraduate non-majors courses, and developing materials on tropical dry forest ecology that will be distributed to thousands of Costa Rican school children."
759026,"The goal of this project is to develop single molecule methods for the quantitative study of DNA interactions with small molecules and proteins and to use these methods to investigate specific biologically important systems. The investigators will use several DNA constructs (long and short double-stranded and single-stranded DNA molecules) and data analysis methods to probe the thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA-ligand interactions and determine the time-dependent changes of DNA structure as proteins and small molecules bind. In addition to method development, this work will shed light on the fundamental biophysics of DNA-small molecule interactions as well as the biophysical and biochemical mechanisms of multiple protein interactions involved in retrotransposon replication and DNA damage response. This project involves three specific aims: 1. To probe the structural dynamics of DNA-small molecule interactions using single molecule force spectroscopy. 2. To probe dynamic protein-DNA interactions important for LINE1 retrotransposition. 3. To probe the protein-protein and protein-DNA binding interactions that participate in the management of DNA polymerase switching in E. coli. The PIs will develop methods for understanding multiple protein interactions with DNA and use these methods to probe interactions involved in DNA polymerase management, which is critical for cellular responses to DNA damage. <br/><br/>The PI has developed innovative biophysical methods for examining DNA binding using single molecule manipulation. The PI integrates his research into teaching experimental methods, and he has a strong track record of training graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research at the interface of physics, chemistry, and biology. In addition to regularly hiring full-time 6-month physics co-op undergraduate students, he has hosted undergraduates from several other undergraduate institutions. The PI is hosting a professor and three of his students from a regional university with a majority of first-generation college students. This experience will be used to expand biophysics research and introduce biophysics into the university's curriculum. The co-PI is a Professor at a liberal arts college for women with a historical tradition of training undergraduate women scientists. She will involve multiple students in synthesizing DNA constructs and small molecule complexes that they will bring to Northeastern and characterize by single molecule force spectroscopy. This project is jointly supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division."
659505,"An improved understanding of the process of evolutionary genetic adaptation must rely in part on a better understanding of how genetic changes are linked to changes in structural and functional characteristics of organisms (phenotypes) that result in improved reproductive success (i.e., fitness). However, the relationship between genotype and phenotype is not well understood, limiting an understanding of the evolutionary process. The work funded by this award will investigate the relationship between genotype and phenotype on an unprecedented scale in the bacterium Escherichia coli. The bacterium has been adapted through artificial selection experiments to thermal stress (42.2 C) for one year in over 100 replicate populations. A clone from each population has been genotyped completely by genomic sequencing. This grant will characterize the phenotypes of these replicate populations and then relate these phenotypes explicitly to the known genotypes. The phenotypes that will be measured include patterns of gene expression and features of cell metabolism. Of particular interest will be a contrast between clones that adapted by mutations in either the transcriptional termination gene rho or the RNA polymerase subunit gene rpoB. The work will determine whether these different genetic solutions lead to similar functional changes in phenotypes and whether the two adaptive pathways are mutually exclusive. To address the latter issue, mutations of both rho and rpoB will be introduced into a single genetic background, and the evolutionary fitness of double mutants will be determined at high temperature. By characterizing both phenotypic changes and genetic interactions associated with adaptation, this work will impact the heart of evolutionary theory, including classical views on the adaptive process. In addition, this project will continue a successful outreach project that introduced K-12 teachers to lab modules that facilitate ""hands on"" teaching of evolution in the classroom, based on the E. coli model."
549760,"Parasitic organisms have independently evolved in every major lineage of life on Earth, however we know very little about the transition from free-living to parasite. Red algal parasites are ideal model organisms for investigating the origins of a parasitic life-strategy because most red algal parasites share an immediate common ancestor with a free-living red algal species. Therefore, a single pair of organisms can provide direct comparative data on the genetic changes occurring early in the evolution of a parasite. This project will characterize the co-evolutionary relationship from three species pairs of hosts and their parasites, then establish the effect of a parasitic strategy on their genomes <br/><br/>This study will provide information relevant to dealing with some of the most damaging eukaryotic pathogens and parasites (e.g. , the causes of malaria, toxoplasmosis, sudden oak death, and the Irish Potato Famine). Additionally, red algae are important players in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the world and are among the dominant members of the benthic coastal community. This study will involve the training of undergraduates, a graduate student, and a postdoctoral fellow. URI's highly successful NSF-sponsored Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program will be used to recruit undergraduate and graduate researchers."
726738,"Many organisms across the tree of life can distinguish between themselves and other members of their species via cell-cell contact. In vertebrates, this process controls graft rejection and auto-immune responses. In colonial invertebrates -- animals like marine sponges, corals, and sea squirts -- this ability is called allorecognition. Allorecognition controls whether colonies aggressively compete for space or peacefully coexist when they encounter one another as they grow. Despite the biological significance of this phenomenon, the genes and proteins that underlie it remain poorly understood. In this project, the investigators will study the molecular basis of allorecognition in a cnidarian, Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Recently, two genes controlling allorecognition in Hydractinia have been identified. The investigators will determine how the proteins encoded by these genes allow Hydractinia to properly distinguish self from non-self. To do this, the investigators will combine biochemical experiments with computer modeling and x-ray crystallography to build a structural model of the proteins, which will reveal how they enable Hydractinia to discriminate between self and non-self. This knowledge will fill a significant gap in our understanding of invertebrate allorecognition and form the basis of future work to investigate how these phenomena evolve. As part of their work, the investigators will train two undergraduates, two graduate students, and one postdoc in protein biochemistry and structure determination. They will provide opportunities for three high school students to conduct independent research projects in their laboratories. They will also develop and implement an educational program about Hydractinia for elementary school students in southwestern Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>In Hydractinia, two allorecognition proteins, Alr1 and Alr2, discriminate between self and non-self. Preliminary studies indicate these proteins engage in isoform-specific binding across cell membranes. This binding is hypothesized to be a general feature of both proteins and to be mediated by trans interactions between immunoglobulin superfamily-like (IgSF-like) domains in their extracellular regions and the formation of disulphide-linked cis multimers. Aim 1 will identify segments in the extracellular regions of each protein that control binding specificity and test whether the proteins form cis multimers via disulphide bonds. Aim 2 will identify amino acid positions within these segments that determine their binding profiles and use computational modeling to explore hypothesized binding mechanisms. Together, Aims 1 and 2 will be used to create a structural model of isoform-specific binding. Aim 3 will validate this model by determining the crystal structures of the extracellular domains of Alr1 and Alr2. Our team combines three PIs with expertise in invertebrate allorecognition, computational biology, and x-ray crystallography. The expected outcome of this project will be the first mechanistic understanding of how allorecognition proteins discriminate between self and non-self in any invertebrate. Comparison of this structural mechanism with those in other self-recognition systems will reveal which aspects of molecular recognition are unique to Hydractinia and which are shared with other species. The data generated in this project will guide future projects investigating how sequence evolution at allorecognition genes leads to novel allorecognition specificities and how signaling through the allorecognition proteins regulates allorecognition responses."
854000,"Kinship is a crucial element in many kinds of cooperation. In order for individuals to cooperate with their kin they must identify their relatives somehow. This can happen through the structure of the environment, or through active recognition processes. Recognition and cooperation can benefit many kinds of organisms. Some of these organisms include microbes where cooperation can actually harm the animal hosts, so understanding kin recognition and cooperation in microbes can have important implications for human welfare.<br/><br/>The investigators will study kin structure and recognition in a social amoeba that has a solitary stage where it eats bacteria and a social stage where it aggregates into a multi-cellular collective that moves and produces spores. They have found that this amoeba can distinguish between related and unrelated individuals and these amoebae use this ability to avoid unrelated amoebae and to protect certain kinds of bacteria. The investigators will test different mechanisms for recognizing relatives in this system. They will document the growth patterns of the amoebae as they prey upon bacteria. They will examine genes for recognition and they will consider the role of dispersal distance in recognition. Furthermore the investigators will explore the mechanisms through which these amoebae exploit the toxicity of bacteria. Taken together, this research has great potential to promote our understanding of the interactions between microbes; which in turn will contribute to our understanding of how microbes directly affect humans and the environment in which we live. The project will contribute to the scientific training of undergraduate and graduate students and will reach out to the public via websites, Wikipedia entries, and events for K-12 students."
607764,"The proposed research aims to understand how plant-feeding insects adapt to their host plants and the extent to which this process leads to the formation of new species in nature. Whereas most pine sawflies feed only on a single type of pine, the redheaded pine sawfly (RHPS) is a major pest of multiple pine species throughout eastern North America. Using a combination of fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and DNA sequencing, the proposed project will determine whether: (1) RHPS are adapted to different pine species, (2) RHPS from different pines are genetically distinct, and (3) RHPS from different pines can produce offspring together, which will indicate whether these are distinct, unrecognized species.<br/><br/>Comprising ~25% of all species, plant-feeding insects are among the most diverse organisms on Earth. By describing how insects adapt to host plants and determining the link between adaptation and species formation, the proposed research will help explain the origin of a sizeable fraction of biodiversity. At an applied level, determining whether RHPS is comprised of multiple unrecognized species will have direct implications for managing outbreaks of this destructive pest. Additionally, this project's integrative nature provides an ideal training environment for undergraduate and graduate students. Finally, because host plant adaptation is an intuitive process and RHPS is part of the local fauna, this research can be used to convey basic evolutionary principles to Biology students. To this end, a related teaching module (lesson plans, presentations, activities, and assignments) will be developed and assessed in high schools in eastern Kentucky."
539000,"Personal odors can play an essential role in communication and individual recognition. Scents make be influenced by genes that are critical for immune function, including genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This study will marry chemical ecology with modern forensic science techniques establishing the Leach's storm-petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa), as a model system studying what appears to be a critical but little studied aspect of social interactions in birds.This long-lived, burrow-nesting species has an excellent sense of smell, making them an ideal model for this investigation. Extensive field study sites have already been established on Bon Portage Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, where over 300 breeding pairs have been genotyped for the MHC class 2B gene. The aim is to characterize the individual odor profiles of these genotyped birds using state-of-the-art chemical techniques developed for human scent discrimination. Specific research objectives are a) to test whether individual birds produce odor signatures related to their MHC-genotype, b) to determine if birds use MHC-related scent marks to label their home burrows, and c) to determine whether the scent of an individual bird is an indicator of individual quality, health and fitness, or plays a role in mate choice decisions. Showing that any species of bird uses MHC-related odors in mate choice decisions would represent a paradigm shift in how biologists think about mate choice decisions in birds, and will provide insights relevant to avian immunology and health in a wide-ranging species. Just as importantly, many species of petrels and albatrosses are facing extinction, and understanding the factors driving mate choice and colony demographics will make a valuable contribution to comprehensive management plans for endangered species. Published phenotypic/chemical or genetic data will be deposited in the Dryad Repository (http://datadryad.org/) or submitted to Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), and deposited in Merritt Data Repository (http://www.dataone.org/software-tools/merritt-repository-service)."
760203,"Dragonflies and damselflies belong to a primitive insect group that occupies a key point in the evolution of insects. They were among the first insects to gain wings, have an excellent fossil record, have the most acute vision of any insect, and are the focus for many speciation and conservation studies. Despite the importance of these insects as a study group, there is no comprehensive phylogeny depicting the evolutionary relationships among these insects. By using anatomical information gathered from fossil and living dragonflies and damselflies in combination with DNA data gathered by harnessing the power of next generation sequencing technologies, this research will produce the first comprehensive phylogeny for this group. This phylogeny will become the foundation for all future research on these insects, including the discovery and description of new species. In addition, this work will focus on deciphering the genes associated with visual systems in these insects, and results from this research will allow scientists to better understand how visual systems evolve. <br/><br/>Several minority undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers will be trained in cutting edge DNA sequencing technology. All personnel will work to convey our research to the general public via a museum exhibit focused on dragonfly diversity and the evolution of their visual systems. We will also use Internet websites devoted to earth's biodiversity (e.g., Encyclopedia of life and Morphbank) to provide the general public and the scientific community with detailed information regarding both fossil and living dragonflies and damselflies. This research will push evolutionary biology forward by innovations in working with fossils, the development of new molecular tools to capture, sequence and characterize genes, and exciting insights that will provide a more in-depth understanding of the evolution of visual systems."
566824,"Urban areas emit the vast majority of anthropogenic CO2, but most efforts to study terrestrial and atmospheric carbon dynamics avoid areas influenced by urbanization. Urban areas are growing in spatial extent and the ecology of cities is becoming ever more germane to people?s lives and the development of carbon mitigation strategies. This research will improve understanding of how urbanization affects ecosystem characteristics and productivity across the Boston urban-to-rural gradient, and develop a framework for analysis of urban impacts on ecosystems, by (1) quantifying how ecosystem productivity changes across an urban-to-rural gradient and developing a clear empirical foundation for productivity estimation; (2) mapping historical and current patterns of land-cover change to determine trajectories of development and the carbon consequences of increasing urban lands; and (3) developing new methods to scale the results of this work from the plot and pixel level to the entire region.<br/><br/>This research addresses the pressing need for science to inform the development of policies that enhance core ecosystem services (e.g., air and water purification, carbon and nitrogen sequestration, food and energy production) while supporting a growing and increasingly urban human population. This work includes the development of a new science education curriculum, collaborations with the City of Boston, and will support undergraduate and graduate student research."
629542,"The genomes (total cellular DNA) of flowering plants, including all crop species, have undergone multiple rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD, polyploidy). The availability of duplicated genes, combined with extensive genome remodeling that follows WGD events, gives rise to a wide range of novel traits. It is clear that gene expression mediates many of these responses, and selection on gene dosage may drive gene family and network evolution. Yet surprisingly little is known about how genome duplication affects individual gene expression or the entire transcriptome (the combined expression of all genes in the genome in a given tissue). This project will use a suite of novel approaches to estimate whole transcriptome size and to assay expression changes of genes across the genome in response to WGD. Several synthetic and recently formed natural polyploids and their diploid progenitors will be studied in order to determine both the immediate and longer-term effects of genome duplication on gene expression. <br/>This project is of broad significance and impact because quantifying dosage responses on a genomic scale will clarify our understanding of how selection on gene dosage has shaped plant evolution, leading to important traits in species of agricultural importance, such as soybean, whose close relatives are the targets of this project. In addition, the project funds opportunities for undergraduates to participate in the research, and facilitates scientific collaboration between a major research university (Cornell) and an undergraduate-only institution (Reed College)."
566910,"Intellectual Merit: The growth and development of eukaryotes is determined by complex interactions between their genetic make-up and the environment. In multicellular organisms, the different types of cells, tissues, and organs are ultimately defined by differential gene expression. Small RNAs (~20-30 nucleotides in length) play important roles in gene regulation as well as in defense responses against parasitic genomic elements such as transposons and viruses. The biogenesis and mode of action of these noncoding RNAs have attracted great attention in recent years, but many aspects of small RNA (sRNA) function are still poorly characterized. One central problem is our incomplete understanding of the factors involved in these processes. Interestingly, in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, sRNAs perfectly complementary to a target transcript can inhibit protein synthesis without or with only minimal mRNA destabilization. This mechanism operates at a post-initiation step of translation and appears to alter the function/structural conformation of translating ribosomes so that they display reduced sensitivity to inhibition by some antibiotics such as cycloheximide. Evidence for sRNA-repressed transcripts remaining associated with polyribosomes, a strong argument in support of post-initiation translation inhibition, also exists in several other eukaryotes. The project will focus on the mechanistic characterization of this relatively unexplored process. It will involve the identification of molecular components of sRNA-guided effector complexes, involved in post-initiation translation repression, and the isolation and analysis of algal mutants defective in this process. The research will also characterize endogenous transcripts preferentially repressed by sRNAs at the translational level and begin addressing the role(s) of small RNAs in algal biology. Chlamydomonas offers an advantage for the isolation and characterization of novel factors involved in sRNA-mediated translation repression since the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery, despite being fairly complex, is not required for organismal viability. Moreover, novel mechanistic insights may be obtained through these studies because algae and land plants appear to lack orthologs of several of the proteins implicated in sRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in metazoans. Characterization of RNAi in evolutionarily divergent eukaryotes is expected to contribute to our understanding of both common as well as lineage-specific mechanisms of sRNA-mediated silencing.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The project will have an impact on human resource development through the direct training of undergraduate and graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow. Students will learn research methodology via hands on experience, with the goal of fostering their interest in scientific discovery. The laboratory findings will be used to stimulate the learning process and to promote discussions on the benefits of algal/plant science research in two plant biology courses. The training of a postdoctoral fellow for a career which combines research and education is also a central component of the project. Additionally, students will participate in a number of programs devoted to the instruction of minority individuals and in outreach activities with a non-profit organization working to educate the public on the nature and importance of science. The results of the project may also have practical implications for the genetic improvement of algal strains for biofuel production. One key constraint for the commercial development of algal feedstocks is the very limited knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression and metabolism. The anticipated findings will contribute useful information for understanding the function of small RNAs in microalgae and for the development of tools to modulate gene expression."
822000,"The completion of this project will boost human knowledge of biological evolution through the study of animal weapons. Understanding evolution is essential for figuring out solutions to modern problems such as antibiotic resistance, a major problem in medicine, and for understanding how life on our planet became so diverse and how it will change next. Animal weapons including such intriguing structures as horns on bighorn sheep, antlers on deer, and tusks on elephants, have fascinated people for centuries. The earliest-known human paintings show wild animals fighting with weapons. In spite of the interest these structures have attracted, understanding of weapon diversity is in its infancy. This project will increase understanding of why even closely-related species can have profoundly different weapons. Simultaneously, it will provide important insights into why other shapes and forms in nature can be so variable. Data and specimens collected as part of this project will be stored in scientific archives and museums, where they will be shared freely with other researchers for use in future projects. This project will also contribute directly to the science education of more than two hundred college students. These students will learn how to do science and to recognize that science is a process, not just a collection of facts. The researchers will also interact and share their results with the general public through blogs, presentations, and student-made videos about experiences doing science.<br/><br/>The diverse traits resulting from sexual selection offer outstanding opportunities for understanding the evolutionary interactions between behavior and morphology. It is now well established that mate choice and male-male competition can select for differences in the sizes of ornaments and weapons. However the evolution of the shape of these traits is more puzzling. Why has such shape diversity evolved? In the case of animal weapons, habitat-driven changes in male-male competitive behavior are hypothesized to be a central factor. However, explicit tests of this hypothesis are virtually nonexistent. This project will examine the roles of fighting behavior, ecology, and function in the evolution of weapon shape, capitalizing on the extreme weapon shape diversity and myriad of fighting styles in leaf-footed bugs (Hemiptera: Coreidae) to address the long-standing puzzle of weapon shape diversity. Methods include experimental selection analyses, finite element analysis, phylogenetics, and ancestral state reconstructions. The successful completion of this project will offer an unprecedented analysis of the evolutionary interplay between behavior and morphology, using the medium of weaponry. Data and specimens will be stored and shared with other scientists through international archives, including NCBI, DRYAD, and the Florida Museum of Natural History. Over 200 undergraduates will contribute to the completion of this project through Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE), and curricular materials developed for this purpose will be shared with other educators through workshops and publications. Training in the integration of research and education will also be provided to a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students, and undergraduates. Substantial outreach will be accomplished through the production of short videos by students, blogs, research spotlights, social media, and public presentations."
779266,"We receive and analyze information from our environment through multiple senses (i.e. sensory channels). When we interact socially, for example, we not only listen to someone?s words but we also read their body language to interpret their meaning. But how does information from different sensory channels interact to influence our social decisions? In this series of studies how acoustic and visual cues influence mate choice decisions will be determined in the túngara frog. As do most frogs, túngara frogs advertise for mates with loud and conspicuous mating calls. Females compare mating calls among males and use this information to choose a mate. But the female?s decision is also influenced by the presence of a visual cue, the male?s large and conspicuous vocal sac. Using robotic frogs it has been shown that females prefer a calling male with a large inflating-deflating vocal sac to a male producing the same call but without a dynamic vocal sac. To build upon those results to address several fundamental questions about how acoustic and visual cues interact to influence female decision making the following will be determined: What is the relative value of acoustic and visual cues? Does the addition of visual cues influence a female?s memory of calls? Do visual cues aid in recognizing individual males in large choruses? Does the addition of a visual cue influence the time it takes for females to make decisions? All of these studies will provide insights into how animals, including humans, integrate information in the environment around them through different sensory channels. In the process of this work, approximately 25 students, many of them women and minorities, will be trained in the use of robotic technologies to study behavior."
512998,"Animals often benefit from adjusting their behavior to environmental conditions, and these responses can be rapid. Yet, individuals often differ in the degree to which they make adjustments (i.e., plasticity of their traits). For example, by reducing its activity when a predator is detected, an individual may be less likely to be detected. For this study, the investigators will assess behavioral plasticity in four contexts: general activity, foraging behavior, competitive behavior, and courting behavior. The overarching goal is to test whether individuals that show greater plasticity in one environmental context also show greater plasticity in others. To measure response differences, individual swordtail fish will be tested both in the presence and absence of a predator. Swordtail fish are a model for melanoma research and their behavior has been studied for 50+ years. Because an animal's size can affect the costs and benefits of expressing particular behaviors, size should also affect plasticity patterns. A single gene largely influences swordtail size, and small males show greater plasticity in some contexts than large males (e.g., in competitive behavior). As a genetic basis of size differences has been identified, this is an ideal system for the proposed work.<br/><br/>Virtually nothing is known about whether individuals that are more plastic in one environmental context are also more plastic in other environmental contexts. Yet, such information is essential for understanding why individuals respond in different ways to environmental change. As the extent to which plasticity can be individually optimized and how plasticity operates in different contexts is not yet known, this work promises to make an important contribution to our understanding of behavioral plasticity. This project will also provide training for graduate students, opportunities for undergraduates to gain an intensive introduction to the scientific process, and outreach activities targeting K-12 students."
546973,"While nature often changes slowly, sometimes large changes occur fast. Fisheries collapse, rangelands decline, and invasive species expand rapidly often with high costs to human society. Big changes in ecological systems are difficult to forecast, but recent theoretical studies and experiments indicate that they are preceded by early warnings. These early warnings are like economic indicators and can be detected in environmental variables that can be measured frequently. In principle when early warning indicators are detected, actions can either avert unwanted changes, like responding to a check engine light in a car, or help minimize risk, like responding to a tornado siren. This project will test the potential to avoid unwanted changes in lakes by detecting early warning signals. Several lakes will be experimentally fertilized with nutrients to create the potential for massive growths of algae. Early warning signals will be detected by continuously monitoring the lakes with modern electronic sensors. In a further experiment, the researchers will respond to signals that indicate impending changes and stop the nutrient additions to one lake in an attempt to avoid algae proliferating to nuisance levels. Treatments to the other lakes will continue so that all possible responses are included.<br/><br/>This project will determine if methods for detecting early warnings signals can be developed. The findings from this study will be extended to a network of researchers who have established continuous measurement systems on lakes throughout the world. If successful, the results should be widely applicable for the management of a range of natural systems, not only lakes. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students and contribute to teaching materials for courses at universities in Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as advanced special topics courses at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York."
580000,"Intimate associations between bacteria and animals have evolved frequently and form the basis for many specialized animal lifestyles. Insects that feed only on sap of vascular plants depend on bacterial partners that live within specialized cells of their insect hosts and that provide nutrients to the insects. These relationships have persisted for hundreds of millions of years, yet little is known about what mechanisms allow both insects and bacteria to rely on each other. This project addresses the question of how these insects tolerate and foster their resident bacterial populations. The project will incorporate experiments on laboratory populations of leafhoppers, which have some of the most specialized symbiotic associations. Typically leafhoppers harbor two different symbiont types that provide complementary sets of nutrients required by the hosts. Investigators will use new genomic and molecular technologies to determine the mechanisms that leafhopper species use to maintain their symbiotic bacteria. To understand the specific host mechanisms that differentiate among bacterial types, investigators will make use of comparisons between related leafhopper species that have different bacteria as symbionts.<br/>This project will give in-depth research experiences to numerous undergraduates at the University of Texas. It will also be the basis for the long-term research program of a postdoctoral researcher who plans future work on insect-bacterial relationships. In addition, leafhoppers are primary vectors of many viral and bacterial diseases of plants, including many major agricultural crops in the United States. For this reason, leafhoppers are some of the most severe insect pests of agricultural systems. Thus, investigators will perform all experiments on two notorious North American pest species. These results will provide new insight into how these pest species interact with microorganisms, including both symbionts and disease organisms."
610000,"A longstanding challenge in behavioral research has been to identify the internal factors that bring about differences in behavior between individuals or species. Despite the importance of this goal, there is a paucity of information about the genetic and neural mechanisms that underlie the dramatic differences in behavior observed within and among species in the wild. This project seeks to identify the mechanisms that underlie divergence in social behaviors, using schooling behavior in stickleback fish as a model system. Sticklebacks are an emerging genetic model system with numerous populations that differ in behavior, making them ideally suited to this work. Sticklebacks from marine and freshwater environments exhibit striking differences in schooling behavior. A combination of modern genetic and neurobiological approaches will be used to dissect the genes and neural circuits that underlie differences in schooling behavior between stickleback populations. <br/><br/>This work has the potential to yield one of only a few known ""behavior genes"" in any system and one of the first genes that shape behavioral differences between divergent populations of animals in the wild. In addition, this work seeks to link genetic variation to variation in the nervous system, thereby providing important insight into the process of behavioral divergence. <br/><br/>This project will provide opportunities for undergraduate students to gain experience in cutting- edge genetic analysis. In addition, a collaboration has been established with a Seattle-area high school serving a diverse community of students. These students will participate in the analysis of the behavioral and genetic data from this project, providing them with a unique opportunity for engagement in the scientific process."
629942,"An award is made to the University of Utah to purchase an isotope ratio mass spectrometer in support of research on human-environment interactions. The new instrument will be installed in and managed through the Stable Isotope Ratios for Environmental Research (SIRFER) facility, a campus core facility associated with the University?s Global Change and Sustainability Center. Faculty affiliates from across campus will use the new instrument to make novel measurements of the distribution of stable isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in a wide range of environmental compounds. These data will allow the researchers to reconstruct the history of human interactions with the environment through the study of sedimentary archives and tree rings, understand and quantify the cycling of carbon, water, and nitrogen within human-dominated landscapes, and identify the indirect effects of human activity on the climate, hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry of areas not subject to high-density human habitation. Urbanization, ecological planning, and water and nutrient issues in the western USA will be dominant foci for this work, which will leverage ongoing collaborative research projects and infrastructure development efforts at the University. As a part of the SIRFER facility, the new instrument will be a cornerstone of a facility that is leading the integration of traditional mass spectrometric methods for isotope ratio measurement with next-generation laser-based techniques, and will provide calibration and validation support for a large number of high-frequency laser systems used by the project team for monitoring of environmental isotope ratios.<br/><br/>The new mass spectrometer will be used in undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of Utah and provide opportunities for students in these courses to explore new environmental systems and measurement techniques. It will support broad-reaching graduate student and postdoctoral training efforts associated with the Interuniversity Training in Continental-scale Ecology (ITCE) program, which coordinates two graduate-level summer short courses each summer and supports postdoctoral training and research in support of large-scale ecology and Earth science. Research supported by this work involves extensive collaboration with social scientists, engineers and planners, and these collaborations will help leverage research results to improve the planning and management of the coupled human-environment system."
746459,"As rates of parasitism increase and species invasions skyrocket, there are increasing numbers of outbreaks of disease that result from novel host-parasite pairings. How do hosts and parasites evolve in response to these new interactions, and what are the consequences for ecological dynamics of native and invasive hosts? This project uses interactions among a native bacterial parasite, a native zooplankton host, and an invasive zooplankton host that is now infected by the native bacterial parasite to ask how parasites adapt when they first enter a novel host. Existing genetic archives for both host and parasite provide a rare opportunity to study the important process of how pathogens that originate in one host species move to another; this host switch is very difficult to observe in nature. In addition, observational studies of lake populations, laboratory experiments and mathematical models will be used to understand how parasitism influences population dynamics of native and invasive hosts. <br/><br/>An important component of this project involves educating, training and diversifying the next generation of scientists. The principal investigator will work with science educators to develop hands-on, experiential learning activities for inner city children in Atlanta, focusing on plankton and microbes. Informal science education activities aimed at the general public will also be developed, and will be used to engage visitors to an inner city park. Pre-teacher undergraduates from Georgia Tech will be trained in scientific research, educational research, and pedagogy. In addition, students from Georgia Tech and nearby Spelman College will be involved in the proposed research, gaining valuable research experience. Finally, because many new human pathogens likely arose in different hosts, understanding the process by which pathogens jump from one host to another will have broad societal significance."
915912,"Embryos of many species assess and respond to their environment in ways that matter for survival. Many features and challenges of embryonic life are broadly shared across animals, but frog eggs are particularly tractable to study. Structures such as egg capsules protect and constrain the embryo inside, creating a trade-off of costs and benefits. Upon hatching, animals enter a new environment, with both new dangers and resources. When to hatch is an essential decision embryos make, based on environmental cues. Hatching is also a physical feat that embryos must perform. The ability to assess cues, to exit the egg, and to survive outside the egg all change as embryos develop. Thus, under the same conditions, what embryos can do and what they should do to survive also changes. This project will examine how and why development changes behavior, using embryos of red-eyed treefrogs that hatch up to 40% prematurely to escape threats to the egg. It will assess the importance of maturation, adaptive changes in decisions matched to abilities, embryonic learning, and how embryos use two kinds of information; simple cues of oxygen availability and complex vibrations that can indicate predator attack. It will improve our understanding of embryo lives, behavioral development, and how animals use different kinds of information to make decisions, including broadly important but poorly understood vibrational information. The adaptive behavior of embryos is accessible and appealing, and thus ideal for scientific education and outreach. This project will offer interdisciplinary biology-engineering training for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as Neotropical research and cross-cultural experiences for US students and Latin American interns. The PIs will work with the media, museums, and zoos to disseminate results broadly. They will offer research experiences for teachers and develop online multimedia resources for educators at multiple levels. New methods and tools developed by this project will facilitate other research on embryo behavior and animal responses to vibrational cues. <br/><br/>This project is an integrative study of the development and regulation of environmentally cued hatching in red-eyed treefrogs, for which multiple selective trade-offs shaping hatching timing are known. Embryos use cues in at least two sensory modalities for their hatching decision. Older embryos hatch more readily, but even 30%-premature embryos sometimes hatch within seconds of a cue. This project will assess: I) how the speed and success of hatching change across effector development, focusing on hatching glands; II) how sensor development changes sensitivity to cues and cue properties, addressing developmental changes in mechanoreception by the inner ear and lateral line vs. more consistent, early developed, oxygen sensing; and III) how hatching decision rules for responses to simple hypoxia cues and complex vibrational, and potentially tactile, physical disturbance cues are shaped by developmentally changing trade-offs, a history of stage-specific selection, and the earlier experiences of embryos. The team will use (a) histology and microscopy to characterize morphological changes, (b) respirometry to assess metabolic changes, (c) measures of vestibulo-ocular reflexes to assess otic function, and (d) macro-videography to analyze embryo behavior and hatching performance. They will assess ontogenetic changes in hatching under controlled hypoxia, vibration playback, and predator attacks, and develop new playback methods for separating motion and tactile components of physical disturbance cues. Mechanosensory stimuli and hypoxia are common cues for hatching across taxa. Moreover, vibrational signals and cues inform behavior in many other contexts, later in life, and oxygen availability shapes the behavior of many aquatic animals. Results from red-eyed treefrog embryos will advance our understanding of behavioral development and animal information use more broadly. Datasets will be deposited in DRYAD. Outreach materials, including images and video, will be posted on Warkentin's lab website or contributed to the Encyclopedia of Life or National Association of Biology Teachers web resource page."
791027,"Intellectual Merit. In eukaryotes, proper gene expression is vital for the control of many cellular processes and responses. The initial step of gene expression requires the copying of the DNA into an intermediate molecule called the RNA via a process called transcription. During transcription, the unfinished RNA must simultaneously be processed by a multitude of specific proteins, including the splicing factors (which are members of a macromolecular protein complex called the spliceosome), in order to generate a final, finished product. As the RNA molecules are made and processed, they are packaged into a complex called messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particle and once finished, the entire mRNP is then exported out of the cell nucleus. To achieve and coordinate the coupling of these biological processes, the RNA-binding proteins must be recruited to the RNA in a very precise order during transcription. As a way to expand or to regulate the function of a protein, many RNA-binding proteins are modified chemically by specific enzymes. Arginine methylation is one such type of chemical modification that is found on many RNA binding proteins, and this modification is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT). This enzyme family has been identified in species ranging from the budding yeast to humans, with the most conserved member of this family being PRMT1. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it was established that yeast PRMT1 (termed Hmt1) plays a functional role in promoting the recruitment of splicing factors during transcription, which is vital to mRNP formation. The goals of this project are to examine the mechanisms by which protein arginine methylation modulates the co-transcriptional recruitment of splicing factors in the simple eukaryotic model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomic, and genomic methodologies will be used. Because of the high conservation between yeast Hmt1 and its homologs in higher eukaryotes, the information obtained from this project will provide insights that will likely be applicable to those organisms.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This project will provide opportunities to train graduate students and post-doctoral fellows at University at Buffalo, which is a very diverse campus. The graduate students will receive training in the areas of molecular biology, biochemistry, and genomics. Undergraduate students will also be recruited to take part in various aspects of this project and these recruits will include members of the New York Collegiate Science & Technology Entry (CSTEP) program, an enrichment program for students who are economically disadvantaged or historically underrepresented. Since the project involves the use of molecular biology with genomics and computational analysis, the students will benefit from crossdisciplinary training. Travel funds will be used to allow students to present talks and posters at national scientific meetings. Findings from this work will be incorporated into an Advanced Molecular Biology laboratory course offered to the more senior undergraduates at University at Buffalo. The microarray data generated from this project will be made available to the public."
758540,"Intellectual Merit <br/>Lignin, the second most abundant terrestrial biopolymer after cellulose, is essential for the viability of vascular plants. However, its presence in the cell wall constitutes a formidable obstacle in chemical pulping to produce fine paper, for digesting the forage crops fed to ruminants, and for producing renewable biofuels from cellulosic biomass. The biosynthesis of monolignols, the precursors to lignin, occurs in the cytosol, i.e., the intracellular fluid present in plant cells. Thereafter, these monomeric precursors are exported into the cell wall, where they are polymerized and integrated into the wall?s matrix. Accordingly, the transport of monolignols across the cell membrane is a critical step affecting the deposition of lignin in the secondarily thickened cell wall. While the biosynthesis of monolignols is relatively well understood, the knowledge on the molecular basis for sequestering and transporting those lignin monomers is largely unknown. The aims of this project are the following: 1) through biochemical studies in gymnosperms and in angiosperms, to explore and clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the subcellular sequestration and transport of lignin monomers across the plasma membranes; and, 2) to identify and characterize the particular membrane transporters involved in lignin deposition during the formation of secondary cell walls. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This project focuses on one of the most critical, yet least studied, metabolic steps in plant<br/>lignification. The knowledge gained from it will further the understanding of lignin biosynthesis, and very likely support a better biotechnological solution to efficiently manipulate the lignification process, thereby enhancing the agricultural and industrial applications of cell wall biomaterials. This project also contains a substantial educational component that involves the training of young scientists as the central focus. In addition to training postdoctoral research scientists, graduate students, and technicians, the project will encompass a vigorous program aimed at teaching science at junior levels. High-school students, along with minority undergraduates will be recruited from Stony Brook and local colleges through summer internships and academic year collaborations, and will be introduced to the ways of conducting scientific research. This experience will help students solidify their interest in pursuing a career in science; it also represents a valuable outreach activity to the scientific community."
591595,"A team of scientists from the Chicago Botanic Garden, The Morton Arboretum, and partner institutions will conduct research at the intersection of evolutionary biology and ecological restoration -- the repair of damaged and degraded habitats. Their research investigates the practical implications of a fundamental finding of evolutionary biology: plant species that are less closely related to each other tend to be more distinct in their traits and in the ecological roles they perform. This is important, as groups of plants that encompass greater trait diversity better support key goals of conservation and land management, such as carbon storage and support of wildlife. This project will test whether selecting an unusually diverse (evolutionarily unrelated) set of plant species to use in prairie restoration is a good rule-of-thumb for achieving better outcomes in restoration of degraded ecosystems. In addition, the project will contribute to scientific engagement of high school and college students and the training of early career scientists. Outreach to the public will be performed through the lead institutions? broad networks of members and visitors.<br/><br/>A key challenge for restoration science is to guide the development of diverse, resilient systems that provide the full suite of services associated with natural communities. Incorporating phylogenetic diversity into restoration is an underexplored, potentially powerful tool to help meet this challenge. This project will address questions important to both basic and applied ecology through observational and experimental approaches that test the influence of phylogenetic diversity on restoration outcomes in prairie ecosystems. Decision analysis will be used to determine how restoration managers can incorporate phylogenetic considerations into multi-objective restoration efforts. Results will be translated into practical tools for restoration, including web-based tools for guiding species-selection decisions."

In particular, this project seeks to reveal how disorder is utilized to increase efficiency and accuracy in the cell. The molecular system of interest is the ribosome, a large complex responsible for building proteins. Within the ribosome, large-scale conformational rearrangements facilitate the transfer of energy between chemical and mechanical steps. To identify the molecular origins of these steps, this project will investigate the dynamics of Elongation Factors, the molecules that serve as the ribosome's ""engine."" By identifying the functional properties of these molecules, these studies will reveal the physical principles that control biological function.<br/><br/>This project will have societal impacts, at both the local and international level. This work will engage undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and expose them to a diverse range of topics in the life sciences and physical sciences. As members of the research team, these students will be tightly integrated within the scientific community, having opportunities to present their work at conferences and other public venues. Additionally, the methods used in this project will be incorporated within the undergraduate curriculum, which will instill an understanding of the connection between basic science education and real-world research. This project will also provide nationally-accessible training workshops in molecular modeling to the broader scientific community. This will enable trainees to apply theoretical approaches when designing more-precise experimental studies. Internationally, this project will contribute to the growth of biophysics research abroad through direct scientific collaborations with Brazil. Further, these collaborations will enrich the scientific and cultural experience of students in the US by immersing them in an international research environment. This will give them opportunities to develop a global network of colleagues, which will help them become internationally recognized scientific leaders."
808433,"Various plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions take place in the rhizosphere, the outcomes of which influence plant health and productivity. The molecular communication between bacteria and host plants that allow the establishment of specific symbiotic or pathogenic plant-bacteria interactions are known in detail. However, commensal plant-microbe associations that dominate in the rhizosphere have not been studied to the same extent and relatively little is known regarding the strategies used by commensal soil bacteria to initiate a loose association with plant root surfaces or the spatiotemporal dynamics of these associations. This research aims to characterize key bacterial determinants implicated in the establishment and maintenance of commensal bacteria-plant associations and the spatiotemporal dynamics of these associations, in real-time. Experiments will characterize the role of sensing and chemotaxis in the association of Azospirillum brasilense with wheat roots, which is an excellent model to quantitatively analyze beneficial commensal plant-microbe associations at high temporal and spatial resolution scales. Using iterations between experiments and mathematical modeling, the research will characterize the selective advantage that multiple chemotaxis pathways provide to the ability of bacteria to sense and respond to gradients relevant to their lifestyle in the soil and in the rhizosphere. Next, the role of receptors capable of integrating metabolic status with sensing in mediating rhizosphere colonization will be determined. The project will also use a novel expression system to track how changes in the intracellular concentration of a key metabolite (c-di-GMP) affect locomotor behaviors in real time. Last, a quantitative approach to monitor, in real-time, the role of sensing and chemotaxis in the spatiotemporal dynamics of commensal plant-root colonization will be implemented. Most soil bacteria form commensal associations with the roots of plants and the sequenced genomes of these bacteria encode at least two Che pathways. Results obtained will be directly transposable to other motile soil bacteria and will provide much needed quantitative insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of commensal plant-microbe associations. This knowledge is a prerequisite to a systems-level understanding of the diverse plant-microbe associations that exist in the rhizosphere. The approach to real-time and quantitative monitoring of commensal plant-microbe associations will document the spatiotemporal dynamics of these associations for the first time and ultimately inform future effective strategies to manipulate the rhizosphere to improve plant health and productivity. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will provide new tools and methods to quantitatively analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant-microbe associations, including approaches to track real-time root-microbe associations. The mathematical model derived from this research will be useful in future systems-level simulations of plant-microbe associations for rhizosphere manipulation and promotion of plant health. The project will also characterize sensory modules that will enhance the synthetic biology toolkit. In addition, cross-disciplinary interactions in biology and mathematics for graduate students and undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented groups in the sciences, will be established."
657250,"The Green Algae Tree of Life (GRAToL) is a project involving the collaboration of five institutions to understand the evolutionary relationships of all of the major groups of green algae, a diverse group of more than 14,000 photosynthetic species worldwide. Green algae are abundant and play important roles in a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic habitats, including deserts, extremely salty ponds, and coral reefs, and several species are symbiotic partners with lichens and animals. Thus, green algae are important primary producers in most ecosystems. Green algae are diverse in form - from microscopic single cells to large seaweeds - and function as important primary producers in most ecosystems. The project will employ DNA sequence data to assemble a tree of life reflecting the evolutionary history of the group. This tree will be critical for an improved classification of known species of algae as well as species that are yet to be discovered. The project will facilitate further studies of green algae genomics and evolution.<br/><br/>The project will train 3-4 postdoctoral researchers, several graduate students, and numerous undergraduate students in basic research on algae and genomics. New analytical tools will be developed for use by the broader scientific community. A public exhibit on the GRAToL will be produced, along with a web site containing images and other information on evolution of the group that will be of interest to educators and the general public."
774964,"Intellectual merit:<br/>Stressors such as plant pathogens (bacteria, fungi and viruses) cause enormous losses of food crops. Understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to such stressors and develop immunity is critical to reducing such losses. Calcium, a key signaling molecule in all eukaryotes, has been implicated in plant immunity for decades, and numerous studies have revealed rapid and temporary changes in cellular calcium levels in response to pathogen attacks. However, how calcium regulates pathways involved in plant immunity is poorly understood. This project concerns a small family of transcription factors that are regulated by calcium; these factors were first discovered in plants and then in animals. One of these factors, named SR1, is a negative regulator of plant immunity. SR1 interacts with two other transcription factors. The goal of this project is to use genetic, cell biological, biochemical, molecular, and bioinformatics tools to study the biological roles of SR1-interacting proteins in plant immunity. Single and double mutants of SR1-interacting transcription factors will be used to analyze plant defense responses, the roles and functional significance of various conserved domains in SR1 will be studied, and global identification of targets of SR1 and its interacting transcription factors will be implemented. Overall, this project will contribute to understanding the functions of a calcium-regulated transcription factor in plant immunity.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The knowledge obtained from this project will be relevant to agriculturally important plants as the calcium-modulated transcription factors are highly conserved in crop plants; a better understanding of the function of SR1 and its interacting proteins will have potential applications in reducing the food crop spoilage that results from infection with plant pathogens. This project will integrate research and teaching by training high school students, undergraduate students, a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher in various aspects of genetics, bioinformatics, cell and molecular biology and by encouraging their participation in national scientific meetings."
940228,"Recent studies clearly show that evolution can be very rapid, with substantial genetic change in traits occurring in as little as five to 10 generations. Rapid evolution occurs in response to major environmental changes, both natural and human-mediated. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying the rapid evolution of traits are unknown. Wild radish flowers represent an excellent model system to investigate these genetic mechanisms. Previous NSF-supported projects on this species have produced both abundant genome sequence data and demonstrated rapid evolution of floral traits that are essential to plant reproduction. This project will determine the genetic mechanisms underlying the extremely rapid evolution of adaptive floral traits in wild radish by combining traditional approaches from plant breeding with cutting-edge molecular genetic and genomic techniques.<br/><br/>In addition to improving our overall understanding of adaptive evolution, the proposed project will provide new insights into the mechanisms of successful reproduction in wild radish, one of the world's most damaging agricultural weeds. It will also produce fundamental genetic knowledge. Most genetic studies use highly inbred laboratory strains, but most animals (including humans) and many plants occur naturally in highly outbred populations. To fully understand the genetics of any trait, including a genetic disease, the effects of the genes need to be studied in their naturally outbred state; this project will develop and test new methods for this purpose."
858201,"Intellectual Merit: Cyanobacteria carry out oxygenic photosynthesis in which the inputs are carbon dioxide and light, and the product is stored energy in the form of sugars, with oxygen being generated as a by-product. This process is very similar to photosynthesis in eukaryotes such as algae and higher plants. As also true of other photosynthetic organisms, cyanobacteria exhibit finely tuned abilities to sense and respond to changes in their ambient environment, including changes in light and nutrient availabilty, by undergoing adaptive processes called photomorphogenesis. The molecular mechanisms for allocating resources to balance the energy demands for photosynthesis (sugar production) with the energy costs of responding to environmental variations (photomorphogenesis) are not well understood, and will be the focus of this investigation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Results from these studies are expected to provide novel insights into the molecular bases of balancing the energy demands of sensing and responding to environmental fluctuations in light and nutrient availability in photosynthetic organisms. In addition to the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars and collaborative research and mentoring interactions with students and a faculty member at an Historically Black College and University, broader impacts of the proposed investigations include research and instructional experiences designed to develop the capacity of undergraduate science majors and students from underrepresented groups, including students in the Charles Drew Science Enrichment Program at Michigan State University, to think critically and analytically."
741486,"Intellectual Merit: <br/>If carbon-neutral energy and chemical feedstock solutions are to be developed, these will likely include natural or engineered photosynthetic organisms that manufacture valuable products and/or engineered devices that mimic the principals of natural photosynthesis by coupling of light capture to charge separation and then to endergonic chemical bond rearrangement. An understanding of oxygenic photosynthesis is important on both counts. Despite much progress, there are many important facets of the photosynthetic mechanism that remain to be understood. Of central importance is the water oxidation mechanism catalyzed by photosystem II (PSII), which utilizes water as the source of reductant to fix inorganic carbon. Many aspects of the enzyme's oxygen-yielding water oxidation mechanism remain poorly understood. This includes the repair processes necessitated by incessant photodamage sustained by PSII. These photodamage processes are due to the extraordinary high-potential multi-electron redox reactions that PSII catalyzes; also an important consideration for natural and biomimetic solar energy applications. This proposal addresses two major questions: First, is there a signal conveying the occurrence of damage to an individual PSII complex thereby targeting it for repair or is the repair process a generalized response randomly operating on the population of PSII in response to photodamage-inducing conditions? Second, how are the active site metals, manganese and calcium, assembled into a catalytically active complex? The project will combine molecular genetic, biochemical and biophysical approaches to understand the D1 protein repair process and the assembly and function of the catalytically active complex and also the role of the proteins that tune its reactivity and organize its structure.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Immersing high school science teachers in a research environment that will be combined with professional development activities will help educators gain an explicit view of how scientific knowledge is generated and will also help with their own curriculum development. Teacher participants will be trained to conduct research and mentor students. They will perpetuate this acquired knowledge with their students by implementing new content knowledge and pedagogical skills into their existing curriculum, mentoring students in student research projects and coaching students in science fair competitions. During state and national conferences teachers will share their developed curriculum and mentoring skills with other educators. The PI and Co-PI will disseminate the science research findings and the educational outreach experience at science and education conference, presenting at the OSU National Lab Day, and through research and practitioner journals."
623284,"Intellectual Merit: <br/>Small unicellular cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus RS9916 are estimated to contribute 25-30% of the total marine productivity. Synechococcus is likely to be one of the most ubiquitous phytoplanktonic organisms in the world's oceans and numerically the second most abundant marine phototroph in this ecosystem. This ubiquity and abundance is in large part due to its remarkable phenotypic plasticity in its use of a diverse set of photosynthetic pigments, which is sustained by a complex set of genes and regulatory systems that can be laterally transferred between lineages. Much of this diversity occurs within the protein Phycoerythrin (PE), which has five phycoerythrobilin (PEB) or phycourobilin (PUB) chromophores attached at six cysteine residues. These posttranslational modifications are catalyzed by bilin lyase/isomerase enzymes. As blue light is the dominating wavelength present in the oligotrophic open ocean, strains capable of a process called Type IV chromatic acclimation (CA4) have adapted by increasing the PUB content on their PE to take advantage of the light filtering through the water by a novel mechanism: induction of a bilin lyase/isomerase. The research in this project will contribute to defining the function of these PE bilin lyase/isomerase enzymes that are critical to the success and adaptation of this diverse group of photosynthetic prokaryotes. A better understanding of this novel type of chromatic acclimation (CA4) will be achieved.<br/><br/>The first objective is to characterize the biosynthesis of a ""simple"" PE in Fremyella diplosiphon. Six genes with similarity to known bilin lyase enzymes are upregulated with phycoerythrin structural genes. The second objective involves characterizing the function of bilin lyases specific for PEI and PEII in Synechococcus RS9916, focusing on the characterization of lyases responsible for CA4 changes. Analyses of PE produced in the bilin lyase knockout mutants will be performed, and recombinant protein expression in E. coli to test for bilin ligation and isomerization activity will also be used. <br/><br/>Not only will these studies contribute to understanding how these ecologically important organisms acclimate to thrive in the ocean, they will also biochemically characterize enzymes which will have very important potential biotechnological and cell biology applications for the use of phycoerythrins as fluorescent tags.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>The PI has a strong track record of training undergraduates and graduate students, especially members of under-represented groups in science, and these efforts will continue during this granting period. The PI will incorporate her research into a course called Biological Research Tools where students learn basic molecular cloning and protein expression/purification of phycobiliproteins in E. coli. At least two undergraduates (over the course of the grant) will be selected to go to the laboratory of Dr. David Kehoe at Indiana University (after working in the Schluchter lab for a year first) for 6-8 weeks in the summer in order to learn techniques to generate clean deletions and to study gene regulation related to the CA4 collaboration project. The student is likely to be a member of an under-represented group (50% of the PI's past undergraduates have been minorities), and the purpose of these exchanges is to expose these students to a larger, research university."
773819,"Intellectual Merit:<br/>As the major energy cache in plants and algae, starch is a central component of human and animal food and a key constituent in many manufacturing processes. Additionally, starch is both a first-generation biofuel and is vital to future efforts focused on microalgal hydrogen and oil production. Therefore, elucidation of pathways controlling starch metabolism is needed in order to develop novel strategies that manipulate them and satisfy the growing starch demand. A key pathway regulating starch metabolism - and one that is required for starch degradation - is reversible phosphorylation of glucose residues in starch outer glucans, rendering the granule surface accessible to glucan hydrolyzing enzymes. This sequential cycle begins when two glucan dikinases solubilize starch outer glucan chains by phosphorylating glucose units. Starch phosphorylation allows amylases to bind the starch surface and release the stored energy in the form of glucose and maltose; however, amylases do not proceed past the phosphate groups. Two glucan phosphatases reset the cycle by removing the phosphate groups and allowing processive glucan hydrolysis. Plants lacking the glucan phosphatases exhibit excess amounts of starch, impaired growth, starch with increased phosphorylation and accumulation of starch breakdown intermediates. While progress has been made concerning the biology of reversible starch phosphorylation little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating glucan phosphatase function. This project addresses critical information gaps of this essential pathway by employing a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. This research will define the function, dynamics, structures, and regulation of glucan phosphatases as well as generate and evaluate engineered glucan phosphatases. Completion of this work will define the role of glucan phosphatases in starch modification and degradation, providing the needed insights for biotechnological exploitation of these enzymes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Increasing demand has led to competition for starch among food, biofuels, and industrial manufacturers. An additional concern is that starch processing utilizes hazardous chemicals to modify it for industrial application. Therefore, innovative strategies are needed to increase starch production and to modify starch biophysical properties using less hazardous methods. This project contains integrated and synergistic career goals that will impact the ability to increase starch production and generate designer starches. This project involves multidisciplinary training at several levels. 1) Graduate students will receive national (Kentucky and California) and international (Switzerland) training in laboratory skills, scientific ethics, protein purification, enzyme kinetics, crystallography, DXMS methods, and in data analysis and presentation. In addition, they will be mentored in career options. 2) Undergraduate students, including NSF REU students and those from the Appalachia region, will be trained in basic laboratory skills and in the techniques employed in the lab. They will also receive mentoring in career options. 3) The PI will enhance formal undergraduate courses by integrating research on starch metabolism into an upper level undergraduate course. 4) The importance of basic research on the societal and environmental issues of food production, biofuels, and global warming will be presented to high school and undergraduate students, as well as the general public, at state government events. In addition, results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at local, regional, national, and international scientific interdisciplinary meetings."
570718,"The scientific goal of this project is to discover how and why certain enzymes are capable of evolving new functions. Previous research partially answered the ""how"" question: in addition to their biological function, many enzymes carry out ""promiscuous"" side reactions by chance. If a promiscuous activity becomes useful for an organism, natural selection will act to improve that activity. Although many enzymes have promiscuous activities, they might not be equally capable of evolving new functions. In order to identify characteristics that promote evolvability, this research project is comparing the evolution, structure, and function of a family of promiscuous enzymes to their non-promiscuous relatives. Identifying the sequence, structural, and catalytic properties that were required for the evolution of a new function will facilitate the development of new strategies for engineering other enzymes to carry out new activities. Improving protein engineering methodology has numerous applications in industry and medicine, such as using biodegradable enzymes to replace toxic chemicals in industrial processes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This project will support education in the research laboratory and classroom, providing interdisciplinary training in bioinformatics and biochemistry, a major growth area in the biological sciences because of the development of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. The participation of under-represented minorities in scientific research will be increased by providing full-time summer internships to undergraduates recruited from colleges that mainly serve minority populations and have limited research opportunities. Active learning will be fostered through the augmentation of a lecture course with a research project that integrates concepts from metabolism with bioinformatics methods developed in the research laboratory. Finally, evolutionary thinking will be introduced into a freshman biochemistry and genetics class, with the goal that these students will become citizens who can explain the mechanisms of evolution and how it impacts their lives."
873317,"The objective of this project is to obtain quantitative correlations between the structure and function of G-proteins. Obtaining a reliable detailed molecular description of the action of G-proteins can have a far reaching impact on the understanding key processes in the cell, by providing a more quantitative picture on the communication of information in the cell. Previous studies conducted in this project developed computer simulation methods to study GTP hydrolysis that is controlled by G-proteins. These simulations explored the key role of protein residues whose mutations lead to major change in activity and indicated that these residues act by modulating the coupling between the barrier for the chemical step and structural changes. This idea has been further validated by studies of the activation of the EF-Tu protein, which is involved in the elongation of the amino acid chain during protein synthesis. Attempts to confirm the above findings and to reach more unique conclusions involved systematic quantum mechanical ab initio studies of phosphate hydrolysis in solution, as well as a preliminary combined quantum (ab initio) / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) study of the activation of the protein Ras by the protein GAP. These studies reproduced key experimental findings while giving new insights into the nature of the free energy surface of the reaction. Further advances have been made in studying the conversion of chemical energy to work by the protein F1-ATPase and in studies of the unique unidirectional motions in this and in related systems. This project is placed now at a pivotal point, where it is poised to exploit the above progress and to move in parallel on the following fronts: (i) Further exploration of the activation of EF-Tu and the related protein EF-G , during the protein synthesis process. (ii) Continuing the studies of the chemical and conformational coupling in F1-ATPase. (iv) Exploring the action of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are responsible for the majority of cellular response to hormones and neurotransmitters. (iii) Conducting comparative studies of the action of different G-proteins and determining both the common and different catalytic factors (v) Exploring the information transfer in RasAGP and related systems by double mutations analysis (vi) Pushing for a consensus on the nature of the GTPase reactions by systematic ab initio QM/MM free energy calculations.<br/><br/>The advances in the above research will be integrated into teaching and training programs. The PI will develop a computer-modeling course for students. Movies that illustrate the process of cellular signal transduction and its molecular foundations will be produced. The movies will be distributed to high schools, where they should encourage young people to pursue research in this field."
821855,"The translation machinery is the center of protein synthesis and is present in hundreds to thousands of copies in every cell. The translational pathway requires a large number of macromolecular RNA:protein complexes to ensure its proper function. While the individual components and reactions involved in the pathway have been well studied, an integrated picture resolved both spatially and temporally, progressing from molecules to an entire cell is still missing. This research project is designed to extend our knowledge of the function and evolution of translation to higher levels of organization and scale. On the molecular level, the specific goals of the research are to study communication pathways in the RNA:protein complexes that set the genetic code. Interaction pathways that lead to evolution of specificity and editing in the aminoacyl-tRNA syntheses and communication within the ribosome will be studied using network properties and free energy surfaces obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. The folding/assembly landscape of the ribosomal small subunit will be computationally examined using all-atom and knowledge-based GO potentials. These simulations will be carried out simultaneously with folding experiments on the same systems. To study the kinetics of translation and the folding of DNA in the crowded environment of the cell, stochastic simulations of transcription/translation processes will be carried out using the GPU-based Lattice Microbe program. The 3D lattice models are based upon spatial and temporal information obtained from single molecule, proteomics, and cryo-electron tomography data from intact cells. Hypotheses about how the process of translation occurs at a cellular scale will be tested and extended using systems biology approaches. <br/><br/>All of the visualization, simulation, and analysis tools to enable the study of macromolecular RNA:protein assemblies will be made publicly available and updated through the MultiSeq and Network View extensions to the popular VMD biomolecular analysis software. Updates to the hybrid MD-Go and metadynamics free energy modules will be implemented into the molecular dynamics program NAMD that is available on all the NSF Supercomputer facilities. In addition any new analysis tools and results will be incorporated into a series of tutorials for teaching computational biology that will be available online. The PI's research group will continue to participate in the NSF sponsored Graduate Teaching Fellows program to help high school teachers prepare state-of-the-art scientific curriculum for their classrooms. The Lattice Microbe method allows stochastic simulations of complex cellular processes and reactions. All cell simulations software will be made publicly available. As with the other computational biophysics techniques developed by the principal investigator, tutorials and users guides will be developed to assist other researchers in using the methodology in their own studies. This project is jointly supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division."
812480,"Technical Description: This proposal is based on the idea that it may be possible to realize key structural and functional aspects of subcellular organization due to the physicochemical phenomena that arise in solutions that are crowded with macromolecules ""like the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm are"" even in the absence of specific biomolecular interactions. Of particular interest is aqueous phase separation, which commonly occurs in polymer solutions and offers a means of compartmentalization. This work will evaluate two hypotheses: (1) that phase separation in the crowded intracellular environment could be largely responsible for the existence and properties of non-membranous organelles, and (2) that these structures could in turn serve as templates for membrane assembly. Experimental models of subcellular cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments will be developed based on crowded solutions of RNA, polyamines, proteins, and neutral polymers. Protein phosphorylation will be used to drive formation and disassembly of microcompartments that will serve as model organelles. Three research objectives are proposed: (1) Dynamic assembly/disassembly of model non-membranous organelles based on aqueous phase compartments that form in response to protein phosphorylation state. (2) Templated membrane formation around these model organelles. (3) Primitive model for mitosis/cell cycle in cell-sized lipid vesicles that contain the crowded solution and phase compartment-based model organelles. <br/><br/>Nontechnical Description: Intracellular organization is a hallmark of living cells, with both membrane-bounded (e.g., nucleus) and non-membranous organelles (e.g., nucleolus, P-granules) performing key cellular functions. The central questions driving these investigations are: What role do relatively nonspecific chemical and physical effects play in subcellular organization and the associated functions of biological cells, and how does complexity arise from a small number of simple molecular components? The investigators hypothesize that, despite the deliberate simplicity of the proposed model cells, they will be able to mimic complex biological processes and specific biochemical interactions, such as the reversible formation and dissolution of RNA and protein-rich compartments, the formation of interior membranes around pre-existing protein-rich compartments, and finally to model cell division in a very primitive mimic of the mitotic cell. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Two graduate students will be trained at the interface of molecular and cell biology, chemistry, biophysics and materials science. Undergraduate students will be recruited to work on this project during the academic year for course credit and in the summer through the various on-site REU programs, with a target of one student during the academic year and one or two students during the summer. Support for one K-12 teacher each summer is included in the budget. The investigators will team with the existing Research Experiences for Teachers program in the PSU MRSEC. Teachers will perform experiments and develop curriculum materials to bring back to their own classrooms the following school year. Real-world examples go beyond the intracellular organelles that motivate the intellectual merit of this proposal to also include, e.g., food science, drug delivery, and environmental remediation.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in MCB/BIO and co-funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in CHE/MPS."
850352,"An award is made to the Broad Institute to identify and validate automated image analysis approaches to extract information from fluorescence microscopy images of co-cultured cell systems, while educating students, scientists, and the public about the theory, practice, and societal impact of biological image analysis. Biologists increasingly use co-culture systems, where two or more cell types are grown together in order to more accurately model their native environment. In order to use these powerful co-culture systems to tackle a wide range of basic biological research questions, the remaining challenge is to accurately extract quantitative measurements from each cell in microscopy images of such co-cultures, given that cell types with diverse morphologies are present. In close collaboration with researchers using co-culture systems, and building on the PI?s successful work in biological image analysis, this CAREER project integrates image analysis research and education. <br/><br/>The project will give the scientific community a validated, open-source software toolbox of image processing and machine learning algorithms readily usable by biologists. The education and outreach efforts of the project will produce validated, engaging educational materials that can be freely implemented by high school teachers around the world.

592529,"Microorganisms are the most abundant and diverse taxa on Earth. Despite their ecological and economic importance, it is unclear what maintains the diversity of microbial communities, what adaptive traits allow microorganisms to contend with novel or changing environments, and what accounts for their exceptional spatial distributions. Recent studies suggest that the ability to enter a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity or dormancy ('seed bank') may be central to answering these questions. This project focuses on the seed bank dynamics of microbial communities. In addition to elucidating key processes and feedbacks that contribute to the maintenance of microbial diversity, the project has practical implications for understanding challenges associated with antibiotic resistance, pest outbreaks, and the restoration of managed ecosystems. Broader impacts of the project include the development of a capstone-research experience for undergraduate students at a Principally Undergraduate Institution, a summer research program for high school students from under-represented groups, an open-source individual-based modeling software package, and public outreach via engagement with science museums. <br/><br/>The overarching goals of this research project are to identify the key ecological and evolutionary processes that generate and maintain microbial biodiversity, and to understand how this diversity in turn influences ecosystem processes. These goals will be addressed by focusing on how and why dormancy varies among microbes as a result of life history trade-offs. Combined with novel insight into dormancy-driven communication networks, the research will determine how seed bank dynamics affect the function and geographic patterns of microbial diversity. Three major objectives pertaining to dormancy and the diversity of microbial communities will be addressed: 1) Test for life history tradeoffs between dormancy and physiological and genomic characteristics by comparing survivorship during prolonged dormancy across a phylogenetically diverse collection of soil bacteria using a traits-based approach, 2) Test predictions regarding the nature of dormancy as a cell-cell communicated response that affects pathogen suppression, plant-soil feedbacks, and ecosystem processes using signaling molecules to directly manipulate microbial seed banks, 3) Develop and test theoretical predictions regarding the contribution of seed banks to geographic patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity using communities of soil bacteria from systems with contrasting disturbance histories."

The Faculty Research and Education Development Program to be implemented in this project focuses on promoting the competitive grant-writing skills of junior faculty at Minority Serving Institutions by matching junior faculty with experienced mentors who are successful senior faculty at research-intensive institutions. The year-long structured mentoring process will focus on the preparation and submission of a grant proposal. In addition to regular (at least monthly) communication between junior faculty and mentors, the program will include 1) Career Development Workshops for junior faculty and mentors, to be held each year 2) reciprocal visits by junior faculty and their mentors to each other's institution, at which they will present a seminar 3) meetings for junior faculty and mentors at the Annual Conference in December of the American Society for Cell Biology. A curated publicly accessible and searchable website will be developed to disseminate results of this program and to serve as a resource for junior faculty and mentors throughout the US. Summative and formative evaluation will be performed by a professional evaluation consultant. Broader Impacts: The goal of this project is to promote the skills in research and education of junior faculty at Minority Serving Institutions, and thereby to improve the educational environment for the undergraduates whom they teach and mentor. Web-based dissemination of the results of this program will make this model accessible to others, and will provide a resource for young scientists to assist them in their professional advancement."
951326,"Biologists have long hypothesized that insects and pathogens are directly involved in the origin and maintenance of plant diversity, especially in the extraordinarily diverse tropical rainforests. The evolution of novel chemical defenses that deter insects and pathogens has been thought to allow plants to expand their geographic ranges, thereby promoting the formation of new species. Very little is known about the identity or distribution of the enemies that attack tropical plants or how host-specific they are. In this research, populations of 45 species from a common, diverse genus of tropical rainforest trees (Protium) in Peru, Brazil and French Guiana will be studied to learn about which insects and pathogens attack the plants and how the plants defend themselves. By simultaneously studying natural enemies, plant defenses, and the evolutionary history of plants, insects, and soil pathogens the investigators will gain new insights on the processes that generate high biodiversity in the Amazon basin. <br/><br/>This project will train scientists both in Peru and the United States, with a focus on promoting opportunities for students from underrepresented socioeconomic groups. A summer field course in Peru will be developed for Peruvian and US students at the University of California at Berkeley, that will teach ecology, evolutionary biology, taxonomy of plants and insects, experimental design and research methods. This project will integrate research and education with international field biology and involve minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students will be recruited from an existing program at Berkeley that mentors first-generation college students, providing critical field biology opportunities for students who are generally offered only lab-based research positions."
788782,"The interaction of peptides and proteins with lipid membranes is key to many biological processes. Over the past years the PI and his group have developed an implicit membrane model (IMM1) that describes protein-membrane interactions through a solvation free energy term. The model accounts for the effects of surface, transmembrane, and dipole potential and can also model pores of different shapes, making it the most comprehensive model of its kind. The model has been used to address a number of interesting biological problems, including the determination and analysis of membrane-bound protein structures, transmembrane helix association, and membrane insertion of toxins. In this project, this model will be extended in a number of directions. An improved treatment of the lipid headgroup region will yield more accurate results for interfacial binding. Incorporating lateral pressure effects will allow accounting for the effects of lipid composition. Extending the model to curved membranes will allow the study of the mechanism of membrane curvature sensing and generation, which are key in processes like endocytosis or protein sorting. In addition, implicit solvation models for detergents will be developed, aiming to obtain structural information on detergent-peptide complexes, characterize the SDS-denatured state, and study the effect of lipid environment on peptide conformation. At the same time, these methods will be applied to important biological problems, including the structure of the hemagglutinin fusion peptide in bilayers, in micelles, and in implicitly modeled fusion stalks, the conformation of á-synuclein in membranes of different curvature, and the open channel state of colicins. Collaborations with experimental groups will provide synergy between theory and experiment. <br/><br/>This research will be carried out at an institution where the majority of the students belong to underrepresented groups and several programs support the participation of undergraduates in research. Several minority students at the high school, undergraduate, or graduate level have participated so far in the research carried out in this lab. This project will train Ph.D. students in the Molecular Biophysics subdiscipline of the Chemistry and Biochemistry doctoral programs at the City University of New York. The methods developed in this lab are available to the research community through the CHARMM program and can be used by theoreticians and experimentalists in academia and industry to address important biological problems, such as membrane protein structure prediction or understanding the mechanism of action of membrane proteins. This project is jointly supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division."
788000,"Animal species display tremendous diversity in body size and shape, yet relatively little is known regarding the genetic mechanisms responsible for these differences. The objective of this project is to examine this question by determining whether species that exhibit similar limb lengths acquire these comparable limb morphologies through related developmental mechanisms. Anolis lizards are ideal for these studies since they display remarkable differences in limb length between species. During the course of this project the pattern of limb growth and gene expression will be compared between multiple different long-limbed and short-limbed Anolis species. In addition, Anolis species with naturally occurring differences in DNA sequences that control hindlimb formation will be investigated to determine whether these sequence differences can directly alter the function of limb genes. These developmental and molecular analyses will reveal whether different species with similar body forms achieve a similar final appearance through the same or different means. The proposed studies will also generate broader impacts through the creation of new teaching and training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scholars, as well by providing resources that will advance Anolis lizards as a new model system for developmental studies. Finally, the project will integrate research and education through a research module that has been developed for an advanced undergraduate molecular genetics laboratory course."
742397,"Cell-penetrating peptides possess the remarkable ability to bypass the endocytosis uptake mechanism of the cell and are transported directly to the cytoplasm utilizing an energy-independent pathway. Such cell-penetrating peptides can also carry large cargo molecules (proteins, DNA, nanoparticles) across a cell membrane. However, the mechanisms by which cell penetrating peptides are transported across membranes have proven difficult to resolve. This project employs an advanced membrane replica technique to systematically identify and quantify the key interactions and forces that underlie the properties of cell-penetrating peptides. By comparing and contrasting the uptake of cell penetrating peptides in replica membranes and in live cells this project aims to elucidate the mechanism of non-endocytotic peptide-mediated transport.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. An educational toolkit (the MOST kit) will be developed for use in teaching three fundamental concepts: Membranes, Osmosis and Selective Transport. The MOST kit will form the basis for course modules taught at the University of Massachusetts, and for peer-mentored exchange research programs engaging undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts and the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez."
700000,"For many years, it has been known that ion channels control muscle contraction and nerve function. Dr. Bates' group recently showed that ion channels are also important for cells to determine what type of cells they should become. It is completely unknown how an ion channel communicates with other known developmental signaling pathways to participate in cell-fate decisions. The Bates lab uses genetics and light-controlled channels to figure out exactly how ion channels communicate with the proteins that have long been known to specify cell fate decisions. These experiments will determine how different ion flow controls animal development on a molecular level. Dr. Bates has mentored several high school students, over twenty undergraduate students, and graduate students in laboratory research. Funds from this NSF grant enable her to continue inquiry-based teaching and mentoring. In addition, she encourages under-represented groups in science by teaching summer programs for under-represented groups in science."
600000,"The goal of this research is to define the underlying physical processes that guide the collective and emergent behaviors of closely interacting groups of epithelial cells. The small GTPase Ras is important in both intracellular and intercellular signaling networks, and the tools and concepts to be developed in this study will elucidate how Ras regulates multiple emergent behaviors of groups of cells as they undergo development. The project will reveal how Ras, as a key signaling node in pathways downstream of growth factor receptors, couples its activity across multiple time and length scales to orchestrate complex and emergent phenomena in groups of cells. The central hypothesis to be tested is that whereas the absolute level of Ras activity in single cells controls the physical properties of cell motility, cohesion, and autocrine secretory profiles, in groups of epithelial cells it is the relative level of Ras activity between cells that determines their emergent behaviors. These emergent behaviors may be attributed to a competition between the processes of differential motility, differential adhesion (or cohesion), and the community effect (autocrine loops). The hypotheses will be tested using advanced chemical biology tools, live cell imaging and mathematical modeling.<br/>Broader impacts: This project will directly provide quantitative and cross-disciplinary training to two graduate students. Training will include synthetic chemistry, cell biology, quantitative video microscopy, and mathematical modeling. To broaden the impact of the project, computational modules from these studies will be incorporated into a course on distributed control in multicellular systems."
809445,"Neighboring cells need to communicate with one another in order to function properly, maintain proper organization of tissues, and make appropriate responses to changes in their environments. One method of communication involves the direct flow of information through membrane channels that are clustered on the surface of adjacent cells. These clusters of channels are called gap junction plaques and they are composed of proteins called connexin. The removal of gap junction plaques, from the cell surface, is critical to maintaining cell-to-cell communication and impacts numerous cellular functions, including proliferation, cell migration and differentiation. This project will elucidate the needed steps in gap junction plaque removal and determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Increased information on annular gap junction processing and degradation could facilitate the development of new techniques to influence and control cell behavior, including proliferation and hormonal response. The PI will also continue to serve as a resource for the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting professors from minority institutions. She used past NSF research funding to train forty-five undergraduates, eight graduate students, three postdoctoral fellows, seven visiting professors from minority institutions, five high school students, and ten medical students. Most of the students participating in this research over the years have been African-Americans, a severely under-represented group in science. She will also continue her broader outreach through publications, seminars, lectures and workshops for the scientific community and a unique outreach to the general public through art displays and lectures at a local art museum.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the mechanisms regulating annular gap junction processing. The PI hypothesizes that protein kinases via phosphorylation of sites on the C-terminal tail of the gap junction channel protein, connexin 43 (Cx43), play a pivotal role in annular gap junction vesicle processing needed for degradation. Such processing involves annular gap junction fissions as well as the formation of autophagasomes and multivesicular endosomes. Adrenal cortical cell populations will be used to elucidate the role of kinase-mediated Cx43 phosphorylation in annular gap junction processing and degradation. The approach will be to manipulate three kinases [protein kinase C (PKC), Src, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)] known to phosphorylate Cx43 and thought to be involved in annular gap junction degradation. In Objective I, To Measure the Annular Gap Junction Vesicle Degradative Process in Cell Populations in Which PKA, PKC, and Src Activities Have Been Altered. Three complementary methodologies will be used to selectively decrease or increase protein kinase activity: 1) chemical treatments with a panel of agents; 2) knockdown (siRNA) protocols; and 3) infection with replication-defective adenovirus vectors which result in constitutively activated kinases. In Objective II To Measure Annular Gap Junction Vesicle Degradative Process in Cells in Which the Cx43 Phosphorylation Sites Have Been Altered. Connexin mutation and truncation techniques will be used to modify the region of the intracellular ""tail"" of the Cx43 protein thought to be critical for kinase binding and/or phosphorylation. Throughout this study, annular gap junction processing (fission, formation of autophagasomes and multivesicular endosomes and fusion with other organelles (lysosomes, endosomes and plasma membranes [possible recycling of Cx43 to the plasma membrane]) will be investigated with immunocytochemical, quantum dot immuno-electron microscopy, western blot, and time lapse image analysis. Phospho-specific antibodies against the targeted sites are available and will be used to image the spacial and temporal distribution as well as protein amounts of the differing Cx43phosphoforms.The laboratory will continue to serve as a resource for the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting professors from minority institutions. Students will be given a specific project and they will be encouraged to write and present their findings, both to the scientific community and to the general public. The PI will continue to make an impact on the scientific community through publications, seminars, lectures and workshops presented both nationally and internationally. In addition, lectures and installation art displays created, by the PI and displayed at a local art museum, will enable the PI to teach the general public about dynamic cellular events. It is hoped that information gained from this study and the training provided will serve to advance science and thus contribute to public welfare."
943000,"An award has been made to Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) to establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program. The program will provide two-year research experiences in biological signaling to four cohorts of fellows, starting in the spring of 2011 and continuing through spring 2015. Each cohort consists of 4-5 students who will be trained through a multi-mentoring scheme in research related to the ability of life to respond to the environment and communicate essential information. Student projects will be drawn from research on biological signaling at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels with emphasis on quantitative biology and computational modeling. Project objectives include positioning the URM fellows to (1) demonstrate an understanding of how to conduct scientific research, apply principles of ethical and responsible conduct of research, and engage in scholarship; (2) be academically prepared for graduate study in the biological sciences and related disciplines; (3) be confident individuals with positive attitudes about themselves and their careers; and (4) be able to think critically and communicate effectively using both oral and written forms. Students can choose from topics such as the role of lipids in signal transduction and development, biological function of intrinsically disordered proteins, signal reception and responses to stresses in plants, modeling of protein structure and interactions or structure-based prediction of transcription-factor binding sites, among other projects. The impact and success of the IUPUI-URM program will be measured using formative evaluation on aspects related to the planning and implementation of the project and a summative evaluation to assess the degree to which the project goals and objectives have been met.

535000,"This project aims to understand the genetic basis of heterosis (a genetic phenomenon in which a hybrid demonstrates higher vigor than its parents) using the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. Heterosis is widely applied in crop breeding and has contributed to major improvements in crop yields in the last 50 years. Yet, its genetic basis remains elusive, primarily because of the lack of a powerful model organism. Here it is proposed that S. cerevisiae be developed as a model organism for heterosis, with three specific aims. Aim 1 will establish the basic parameters and patterns of heterosis in yeast. Sixty-three diverse strains of S. cerevisiae have been chosen based on their geographic, genetic, and environmental origins, and have been crossed in all pairwise combinations reciprocally to generate 3906 hybrid strains. The growth rates of these parental and hybrid strains will be measured and the prevalence and magnitude of heterosis will be quantified in three biologically relevant conditions. Whether the probability and magnitude of heterosis are correlated with geographic, genetic, and environmental distances between parents will be tested. The genomes of all 63 parental strains will be sequenced to facilitate the interpretation of the observed patterns of heterosis and Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 will map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying heterosis and test competing models of heterosis (dominance vs. overdominance). A powerful strategy to map the QTLs underlying heterosis and to differentiate between dominance and overdominance has been designed by combining backcrosses with the bulk-segregant-analysis-based extreme QTL mapping. QTLs for five heterotic hybrids identified in Aim 1 will be mapped by this method. The mapping in Aim 2 allows the localization of causal mutations of heterosis to small genomic regions of 1-2 kb. In Aim 3, the causal genes of five QTLs will be identified and the underlying genetic mechanisms (dominance vs. overdominance) will be confirmed. Aim 3 will further identify causal mutations and investigate whether heterosis is caused by the effects of these mutations on protein function or gene expression. Overall, the project will provide unprecedented amount of information on the patterns and mechanisms of heterosis in the model organism S. cerevisiae and significantly improve understanding of the enigmatic yet highly useful genetic phenomenon of heterosis. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project are manifold. First and foremost, this project will significantly deepen the mechanistic understanding of heterosis, which is likely to have profound impacts on crop breeding and other applications of heterosis. Second, the project will produce the resource of 63 high-quality yeast genome sequences that can be used for addressing a wide array of scientific questions. Third, the PI has an excellent record of training evolutionary geneticists; this project will allow the training of a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student in classical genetics, genomics, and computational biology, in addition to their conceptual developments in genetics and evolution. Fourth, the PI has trained students through the University of Michigan Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP), which offers outstanding undergraduates underrepresented in their field of study the opportunity to conduct intensive research to prepare them for advanced studies in a Ph.D. program. This project will allow the PI to continue and expand the collaboration with SROP in training underrepresented undergraduates in genetics and evolution. Fifth, research findings will be integrated into the lectures that the PI regularly gives, including the undergraduate courses of ""Introduction to Genetics"" and ""Capstone Seminars in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology"", the graduate course of ""Molecular and Genomic Evolution"", and occasional public lectures."
570000,"Proteins are initially synthesized as linear polymers and must subsequently fold into precise three-dimensional structures. Within a cell, this folding reaction is often error prone and can lead to misfolded and nonfunctional proteins. The cell contains a number of quality control mechanisms for degrading misfolded and nonfunctional proteins. In this project, Dr. Ghaemmaghami?s laboratory will develop a novel technique for measuring the fraction of proteins that successfully fold within the cell after synthesis. Using this technique, Dr. Ghaemmaghami will study variations in the folding efficiencies of several proteins. The results will elucidate relationships between physical properties of proteins and their propensity to fold successfully within a cell. On the whole, this research will establish novel techniques that will facilitate investigations of protein folding inside cells and lead to a greater understanding of factors that influence protein homeostasis.<br/><br/>Broader impacts. Integrated educational activities of the proposal include creating an interactive, web-based teaching module that introduces students and the public to theoretical and practical aspects of modern proteomics. Additionally, a number of research opportunities will be provided to high school and undergraduate students. The multidisciplinary nature of the project (encompassing protein biochemistry, cell biology, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry and quantitative biology) will provide cross-departmental research opportunities to graduate students. The research will lead to the development of mass spectrometry related protocols and novel analysis software and will facilitate proteomic research at the University of Rochester. It will also provide a foundation for cross-departmental collaborative research. The software will be made freely available to the research community and could be widely used by researchers interested in dynamic proteomics."
613839,"An award is made to The University of Arizona to develop a Quantitative Polarization and Phase Microscope (QP2M). QP2M can measure the spectral dependent quantitative polarization properties and phase information of cell and tissue in real time; it is insensitive to motion and vibration because all information is acquired in a single shot. The microscope measures all four properties of light interacting with cell and tissue: intensity, wavelength, polarization, and phase. The ability to instantaneously measure live cells and follow motions and processes over time provides valuable information to the study of cellular dynamics, motility, and cell and tissue morphology. This project will bring multidisciplinary research and education in optical sciences and biology to both undergraduates and graduates students through the research in microfabrication, optical instrumentation, and bioimaging.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to integrate quantitative polarization and phase imaging techniques for label-free imaging of live cell dynamics. Novel color polarization sensor will be developed to detect right circular polarized light and three linearly polarized light at 0, 45, and 90 degree angles, at three wavelengths in a single shot. The sensor will be integrated with a microscope that can simultaneously capture 3 phase-shift images for quantitative phase measurement or 4 images with different polarization states for quantitative polarization measurement. The fast acquisition capacity of polarization and phase imaging will allow the coupling of spectral, phase, and polarization analysis and may reveal previously unattained vital information about the dynamics in living cells, tissues, and whole organisms, leading to new discoveries not possible before. The polarization and phase imaging techniques being developed for this project also enable new applications and experiments in cancer detection, diseases diagnosis and surgery."
806000,"Stress during particular developmental stages has long-term effects on brain and behavior. It was discovered that particular stressors, even very short-duration challenges during the pubertal period in mice cause deleterious changes in the brain's response to the hormones, estradiol and progesterone, in adulthood. Because these hormones influence such a wide range of behaviors in all vertebrate animals, it is essential to understand how a transient event lasting only a day or two can have an enduring negative influence on hormonal response. It will be determined how long into adulthood the effects of pubertal stressors on behavioral response to hormones endure, it will be determined if it generalizes to another rodent species, and it will be determined if this robust effect generalizes to a different immune challenge that works through an independent cellular signaling pathway. Using molecular and epigenetic tools, a novel hypothesis for the cellular underpinnings of this reprogramming of response to hormones will be tested. It is predicted that pubertal stressors cause long-term alteration in regulation of brain receptors for estradiol, and that this is mediated by changes in methylation patterns of the gene for the receptor, ultimately reprogramming behavioral response to estradiol. This research is valuable, because it addresses an important problem for all animals; how does a short-term perturbation cause long-term disruption in behavior? This work will provide unique training experiences for students at all levels aiming for careers in science and medicine. Students are involved at all stages of research from hypothesis development and testing to oral and written communication of results. When trainees learn principles of critical thinking and hypothesis testing through first-hand research experience, it is anticipated that they will share it formally as future educators and physicians and informally in social situations, thereby dramatically increasing the reach of the science."
987629,"Understanding how species coexist, and the role of genetic diversity within and between species, remains a fundamental challenge in biodiversity research. This project focuses on highly diverse communities of clover plants and their bacterial nitrogen-fixing symbionts, rhizobia. Integrating observational approaches, manipulative field, greenhouse, and growth chamber experiments, genomic techniques and phylogenetic analyses, this project will test the importance of rhizobial symbionts and soil feedbacks in coexistence. Gene expression and functional traits will serve as proxies for the ecological niche; this project will determine how these evolve using phylogenetic trees that capture the evolutionary history of species. This project will yield an integrated insight into the molecular, functional, and ecological mechanisms of diversity maintenance and will greatly increase our understanding of biological nitrogen fixation, a critical function of legumes and rhizobia in natural and agricultural ecosystems.<br/><br/>Symbiotic nitrogen fixation has global importance on par with photosynthesis, and this project will assess its functionality in light of genetic variation in symbionts and clover species. This project will train two post-docs and two graduate students and will provide research experiences to undergraduate students through the Plant Genomics at MSU program, and through an exchange program with Howard University at UC Davis. The project will train students in the High School Honors Science Program at MSU and in the Ecological Society of America?s SEEDS program (Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability: Diverse People for a Diverse Science)."
883878,"Gender is determined by genetic constitution in most animals (as by sex XX/XY chromosomes in humans, or ZZ/ZW in birds), and by environmental temperature (TSD) in others, including turtles. Notably, turtle lineages that underwent a transition in the gender-determining mechanism show a 20-fold increase in the rate of evolution of chromosome number, but it is unclear why or how these traits are associated. This project represents the first step to elucidate the functional link between these two traits by testing the hypothesis that chromosomal rearrangements disrupt the location and consequently the regulation of genes controlling sexual development, which in turn cause the transition between gender-determining mechanisms among turtles. By combining molecular cytogenetics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses, this project will reconstruct the organization of the ancestral turtle genome; characterize the chromosomal rearrangements that have taken place among turtles over 210 million years of turtle evolution; and build mechanistic hypotheses about the critical elements in the regulatory network of sexual development that underlie transitions in gender-determining mechanisms in turtles for further study. This project proposes a novel hypothesis about the relationship of genome evolution over large spans of time and gender determination, which if true, could transform our understanding of the mechanism by which gender determination evolves.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The educational activities of this project will help integrate undergraduate discovery-based learning and broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in biology by training students and their mentors; by engaging women and minorities through outreach activities; and by strengthening the PI's qualifications as role model for underrepresented groups."
520000,"The bacterium Wolbachia is known to infect a large number of the world's insect species (among other terrestrial invertebrates), with important effects on the biology of its animal hosts. In many insects, Wolbachia causes a kind of bacteria-induced reproductive failure called ""cytoplasmic incompatibility"" (CI), a phenomenon that favors the survival of Wolbachia-infected insects by a mechanism that, despite intense study, is still poorly understood. Having made a recent, surprising discovery of CI in a second bacterium, Cardinium, that is unrelated to Wolbachia, the investigators in this study will probe the CI mechanisms of Cardinium in parasitic wasps. This project represents the first study of CI mechanisms in a bacterium other than Wolbachia; through the tractability of this experimental system and the comparative insights it can provide, this investigation will ultimately enhance understanding of CI in Wolbachia as well as Cardinium. To address these questions, the investigators will analyze the expression of genes in male and female Cardinium-infected wasps. They will also conduct a microscopic analysis of the mortality of embryos due to CI-causing Cardinium. The insights into CI will contribute to the effective manipulation of CI-causing bacterial symbionts for management of important insect pests and disease vectors. The project will also contribute to middle school science education and training with a curriculum supplement on insects and microbe interactions. Lastly, the project will result in research training (including international training) of a graduate student, two undergraduates, as well as training of two graduate students in K-12 science outreach."
869120,"An award is made to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop and deliver, ultimately in the form of user-friendly software, novel approaches to analyzing protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that employ a unique combination of concepts at the interface of structural bioinformatics, computational geometry, and cheminformatics. Protein-protein interactions play a central role in all major signaling events that occur in living cells. A new family of cheminformatics descriptors of PPIs derived from Delaunay tessellation of PPI interface termed SNAP3 (Simplicial Neighborhood Analysis of Protein-Protein Packing), based on the previously-developed SNAPP approach, will be developed. These descriptors will be employed as part of novel approaches to (1) identify hot spot regions on protein surfaces and (2) predict the structure of protein-protein (or protein-peptide) complexes using novel GridDock docking method to be developed in this project. <br/><br/>In the post-genomic era, analysis and prediction of PPIs is considered critical for elucidating of many if not most protein functions to better our understanding of cell biology, cellular networks and human diseases. This project will provide both the experimental and computational communities with novel and powerful methodologies and software for analyzing and predicting PPIs and enable several important applications including: (1) unique description and comparison of PPIs using chemometric approaches; (2) the identification of unknown PPI hot spots on protein surfaces; and (3) rational design of novel peptides with desired binding specificity against target proteins. It will have a broad impact by making all PPI datasets, computational tools, and models developed accessible via a new module within the publicly available framework, the ChemBench web portal."
563326,"Bacterial and fungal pathogens inflict major crop losses. The bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent for bacterial blight of rice, affects yield stability with losses up to 60% in the developing world. Three groups with complementary expertise have identified a fundamental mechanism for plant disease susceptibility involving Xoo-induced expression of sugar transporters known as SWEETs. SWEETs are involved in the translocation of sugars from photosynthetic leaves to roots, pollen, and seeds in uninfected plants. Xoo directly induces SWEET gene expression using TAL (transcription factor-like) effector proteins, which are injected from bacterium into leaf cells. The team has also shown that genetic alterations affecting TAL effector function through genomic editing of the target sequence in the host can be used to engineer pathogen resistance. The team hypothesizes that growth of the pathogen depends critically on nutrient supply from the host, and that Xoo specifically targets sugar release from leaf cells for supplying carbon and energy to the pathogen. They also hypothesize that this mechanism is relevant for other host/pathogen systems. This work lays the basis for engineering robust and broad disease resistance by targeting SWEETs encoded by a family of ~20 genes in rice and other crops. The results are expected to provide insight into durable and broad resistance and have global impacts on the environment and quality of life.<br/><br/>The insights gained from this project are relevant to engineering pathogen resistance in rice, but due to the fundamental nature of the mechanism the research may have impact in other crops. The project will provide training for high-school, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs with an emphasis on minorities at the interface between organismal interactions, cell biology and nutrition physiology. The work will enhance the educational environments at ISU, KSU, and the Carnegie Institution. The project will provide undergraduates with valuable experience in the latest tools of genetic analysis and engineering."
576518,"The most salient output of brain function is behavior. However, how the nervous system produces behavior is not well understood, largely because most of the neural pathways underlying behavior are complicated. In this research project, vocal behavior of African clawed frogs is used as a model because their vocal neural pathways are simple and straight forward, and the pathways in action can be studied using techniques that were previously developed in the PI's laboratory. In addition to their simplicity and accessibility, the frog vocal pathways provide a unique opportunity to study how female and male brains function differently; male and female frogs produce sex-specific vocalizations during the breeding season, and the injection of male-specific hormones into an adult female results in male-like vocalizations within thirteen weeks. In this study, the focus is placed on one group of cells that are known to play a critical role in the operation of the pathways. A variety of experimental techniques will be used to understand where these neurons are, how these neurons function, and how they respond to male-specific hormones. The results of the study will not only provide us with the understanding of how behaviors are generated in the two sexes, but also provide us with an insight into how human brains generates rhythmic activity such as alpha and gamma waves, many of which are known to underlie cognitive processes, and known to be disrupted in diseased states. <br/><br/>A fundamentally important question in neuroscience is how neural networks function to generate motor programs that underlie behavior. Although analyses of a complete neural network that generates behavior is a formidable task, the relative simplicity of the Xenopus vocal network combined with the development of the fictive preparation (a ""singing brain in a dish"" preparation) and the application of behavioral, electrophysiological, anatomical, and newly developed optogenetic techniques allows detailed investigation of the dynamic organization of brain in action. The results of the proposed study will not only provide insight into the structure, function, and plasticity of the rhythm-generating neural network at the cellular levels, but also allow us to understand the logic of how a feedback loop should be engineered into a network to generate stable rhythms. Rhythmic neuronal activity is not limited to motor systems, but is prevalent across the entire CNS and is considered to underlie important functions such as perception and cognition. Thus, understanding the biophysical principles that govern rhythm generation using a simple neural network has a potential to elucidate mechanisms underlying neuronal oscillations in general. On a technical level, successful application of optogenetic tools to the Xenopus fictive preparation in vitro fills an important gap between research efforts conducted on genetic vs non-genetic model organisms. There are many non-genetic model organisms that present unique questions. The ability to express genetically encoded tools in non-model organisms represents a revolutionary change in the field of comparative neuroscience."
684280,"This project is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. The Integrated Biological Sciences Summer Research Program (IBS-SRP) is hosted by the Institute for Biology Education at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and provides intensive 10 week research training experiences for undergraduate students interested in exploring graduate school and careers in research. The IBS-SRP is a large REU program that includes eight smaller disciplinary learning communities: Biochemistry & Biophysics; Bioenergy; Cellular & Molecular Biology; Computational Biology & Biostatistics; Ecology, Plants & Environmental Systems; Molecular & Environmental Toxicology; Neurobiology; and Virology. Each student belongs to one of these disciplinary learning communities and conducts an independent research project with a faculty mentor in that area. In addition, a faculty member, who provides complementary mentoring and expert advice to students, leads each disciplinary community. Students are expected to do full-time research as well as participate in all program activities. Program seminars and workshops focus on five core biological sciences concepts: evolution; pathways and transformation of energy and matter; information flow, exchange and storage; structure and function; systems. In addition, professional development workshops on scientific writing and presentation skills, preparation for graduate school, biological sciences research career opportunities and ethics and the responsible conduct of research are offered. Each student creates a research proposal poster at the beginning of the program, writes a final paper at the end, and gives an oral presentation at a final symposium. The impact of the program is assessed using various means, including an online REU common assessment tool. Students are selected for participation based on their academic record and their potential for success and interest in graduate school and a career in research. Students who are from ethnic groups underrepresented in biological sciences research, from low-income homes, first-generation college students, or those who attend small liberal arts colleges with limited research opportunities are especially encouraged to apply.

783415,"Why are coconut trees never found north of Florida while Christmas trees (i.e. balsam firs) never grow south of Pennsylvania? These species differ in their tolerance of climatic stressors like frost and drought, thereby limiting their distributions to an area termed the species ""range"". Despite a century of study, scientists are only beginning to understand which factors, including climate, influence the boundaries of these ranges. To address these fundamental gaps in our understanding, the investigator will utilize observational data, experiments and mathematical models to study current and future ranges of five tree species on Mt. Rainier, Washington. The project will assess how competition with other tree species interacts with climate to limit ranges for each tree species; determine whether the distributions of target tree species reflect past as opposed to current climates; and determine how quickly ranges of target tree species can shift in response to the rapid rates of climate change predicted for the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed research are threefold. The study species are economically valuable timber species, and dominate western Washington forests that provide ecosystem services such as water supply, habitat for endangered species and storage of carbon. Thus, the information gained from this research will be valuable to conservation biologists, land managers and policy makers planning for climate change. The investigator will develop a climate change curriculum for an introductory biology class at University of Washington (reaching >2000 undergraduates per year) and a high school course. A citizen science program at Mt. Rainier National Park will increase the general public's awareness of how climate change impacts the natural world."
536534,"How hard should parents work to raise offspring, and how does this work effort influence the number and survival of offspring that parents attempt to raise? These are questions that have intrigued scientists for more than a century, and have major implications for population dynamics of wild animals. These questions have been highlighted among songbirds because species vary extensively in the number of young that parents attempt to raise. Even among species that breed in the same habitat, such as high elevation riparian habitat in Arizona where work will be conducted, species vary extensively in the number of offspring they attempt to raise. For example, a green-tailed towhee in that habitat typically lays 3 or 4 eggs, a red-faced warbler lays 4 or 5 eggs, while a mountain chickadee may lay 8 eggs. A new theory to explain this variation based on risk of mortality to offspring and parents is proposed and this grant will fund tests of the new theory. Species differ in the risk of their young being eaten by predators, with the open cup nests of the towhee or warbler experiencing high predation, while the cavity nests of chickadees experience very low risk of predation. These differences in predation risk affect how long the young stay in the nest; species like the towhee and warbler leave their risky nest 8 to 11 days after hatch, while chickadees do not leave their safe cavity nest until 20 to 22 days after hatch. As a result, the towhee and warbler young cannot fly when they leave their nest, while the chickadees are fully flight capable when they leave. These differences in developmental state of the young when they leave the nest also potentially affect how quickly they start feeding themselves, with the chickadees potentially feeding themselves within a few days after leaving the nest, while the towhee may take 3 weeks to develop this ability. Potentially, towhee parents must work much harder for each young to provide all their food compared with the chickadee where young almost immediately start obtaining some of their own food and can follow parents to reduce their travel. The extent to which parents are willing to work differs among species depending on their risk of mortality over their annual cycle. Taken together, these effects may explain why species differ in the number of young they attempt to raise, and has critical consequences for population dynamics of species. The proposed work will use observational and experimental approaches to testing these hypotheses.<br/><br/>The fledgling period (after offspring leave the nest) is a critical period for demography, but interspecific variation in survival is unknown and documentation will aid understanding of population vulnerabilities to changing environmental conditions. Given the documented economic and aesthetic importance of birding to society, this conservation knowledge is important. Three graduate students whose thesis research will be supported by this project will be trained. Each year, 1 technician and 6 undergraduates will be trained in field techniques and the conduct of science, as well as 8 undergraduates from across disciplines (in and outside of biology) to transcribe videos of parental behaviors. The latter provides outreach to engage diverse students in scientific principles. Students will be educated through discussion sessions that will be used to teach the scientific principles for the work being conducted. To identify possible recruits, we will use broad advertising approaches to further enhance the diversity of social and cultural groups from which we can recruit. Finally, nests provide a rich source of video opportunities to demonstrate differences among species in social interactions, as well as intriguing videos of predation events. The researcher started obtaining short, high definition videos to develop an educational series on parental and offspring behaviors and predation events to put on YouTube for public outreach. PBS Nature is filming a documentary on nest architecture and avian family life that will include footage at the focal field site to further increase public outreach."
661947,"A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2017. Projects are focused on ecological and evolutionary questions requiring significant fieldwork. Depending upon the mentors, projects may be interdisciplinary in nature (e.g. integrating field geology or molecular techniques with field biology. Students conduct independent research under one of RMBL's approximately 25 scientists, with access to a diversity of field sites, ranging from desert habitat to mountaintops. Students also participate in a range of activities designed to help them become active scientists, such as attending RMBL seminar series, participating in a journal club, and sessions involving the responsible conduct of research and career development. Participants attend sessions on how to conduct a research project, including sessions on experimental design and statistics, preparing proposals, giving oral presentations, and writing scientific papers. RMBL recruits students digitally, through its website and the NSF website, as well as through active recruitment by faculty and alumni at colleges and universities throughout the US. Students are selected based upon financial need, potential impact of the program on the student, scientific promise and demonstrated interest in doing a field project. RMBL actively works to expand representation in the sciences by prioritizing selection of students of ethnicities that are underrepresented in the sciences. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The program is assessed through the REU common assessment tool, as well as data from the longitudinal tracking.

748616,"An award is made to the University of California, Santa Cruz to develop a new generation of animal tracking collars and tags for terrestrial and marine mammals that use the animal's own locomotion to power the device. The Energy Scavenging Collar for Animal Physiology and Ecology (ESCAPE) will revolutionize the study of wild animals by dramatically increasing the deployment time of animal biologgers while greatly reducing the cost of and need for re-collaring or re-tagging wild animals. The ESCAPE will lead to significant advances in animal physiology and ecology research by enabling scientists to evaluate the physiological and behavioral responses of wild animals to long-term changes in the environment. The project will use a laboratory-to-field approach to: (1) Design a power-scavenging device that uses the locomotion of the animal to charge an onboard capacitor and battery. (2) Integrate the power generation device with a GPS, accelerometers, and magnetometers to measure animal behavior, energetics, and movement. (3) Test the ESCAPE on three terrestrial species (domestic dogs, trained elephants and wild mountain lions) and its potential assessed on two marine mammal species (trained dolphins and sea lions). <br/><br/>This comparative approach will allow the research to evaluate the ramifications of locomotory mode, body mass and environment on the functionality and durability of the collars or tags. These tests will also provide a ""proof of concept"" regarding the collar's capability to collect, store, and send various types of longitudinal data. By relying on animal movement to charge the device, ESCAPE will provide up to order-of-magnitude increases in tag deployment time, allowing researchers to compile long-term data sets crucial for the study of wild animal physiology and ecology. The development of the ESCAPE will leverage a unique interdisciplinary team from the Departments of Environmental Studies, Ecology and Evolution, Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The ESCAPE collar is expected to be widely adopted by the research community at large and lead to breakthroughs in animal ecology, conservation and management. The insights gleaned from these collars will also greatly inform public understanding of animal behavior and conservation. Outreach activities associated with the research will include presentations at professional academic conferences, monthly public lectures, field trips for middle and high school children, as well as the production of a professional video showcasing the ESCAPE technology. Details on how to purchase ESCAPE collars will be made available at wildlife.ucsc.edu."
898817,"Proteins are the catalysts of life. For such a catalyst to work, substantial reorganization of the atomic structure of the catalyst itself is required. It would be ideal to follow the catalytic reaction directly from the beginning to the end by looking at all the structures on the atomic length scale and in real time. Time-resolved crystallography is designed to achieve this. This technique is able to record up to 10 billion X-ray structures per second. Time-resolved crystallography is a true kinetic method. It investigates an ensemble of molecules in four dimensions, 3 space dimensions and the time. In order to determine a comprehensive kinetic mechanism, an additional parameter, the temperature, will be varied. Crystallography becomes five-dimensional. This project implements five-dimensional crystallography and uses it to investigate two important biological reactions: the photo-cycle in photoactive yellow protein and the photo-optical switching reaction in a biliprotein. Amongst other things, these investigations will pave the way for example for a rational design of optical switches with new colors that can be used for many applications in biophysical research.<br/><br/>Understanding biological catalysis is one of the most important fields in the life sciences. Time-resolved crystallography unifies kinetic with structure determination. With the advent of the world's strongest X-ray sources, the free electron lasers for hard X-rays, five-dimensional crystallography can be brought to utmost perfection in terms of speed and smallness of specimen. This will open new research opportunities. To attract young academics, the PI will introduce macromolecular crystallography to Milwaukee's high schools by training science teachers who work as mentees in the PI's lab. A broad educational program in biophysics at the UW-Milwaukee will attract bright undergraduate and graduate students to be included in ongoing projects. Numerous trips to the world's strongest X-ray sources will give plenty of hands-on opportunities. Results will be distributed through the PI's web page so that anyone can experience the fifth dimension in crystallography."
575543,"Despite the fundamental importance of sleep, the cellular function of sleep remains controversial. Sleep is recognized to be conserved across species, and in recent years sleep research has been extended to model organisms that provide powerful tools for genetic analysis. This project focuses on identification of genes and signaling pathways that control sleep behavior using the roundworm C. elegans as model organism. The principal investigator and her undergraduate students at California State University Northridge, a primarily undergraduate Hispanic-serving institution, have shown that exposure to environmental stresses can trigger sleep in C. elegans. Further, they demonstrated that stress-induced sleep is beneficial, and they have begun to identify several components of a genetic pathway that mediates this beneficial effect. This project expands on this work and illuminates the mechanism through which epidermal growth factor signaling contributes to stress-induced sleep. Additionally, the project uses cutting-edge molecular techniques to identify other genetic pathways critical in the regulation of stress-induced sleep. The broader impacts of this CAREER award include Full Immersion Research Experience (FIRE), a course the principal investigator redesigned with the goal of giving students an original research experience, and the integration of this lab course with the investigator's research program on sleep.<br/><br/>The identification of a sleep state in C. elegans that is triggered by conditions, such as noxious heat or tissue damage, suggests that perturbation of cellular homeostasis may contribute to sleep drive. Stress-induced sleep (SIS) in C. elegans may represent an ancestral state that evolved to promote recovery following environmental stress or infection. In more complex organisms, SIS may be coordinated with circadian regulation, acting to counteract perturbations of homeostasis known to be associated with prolonged wakefulness. The aim of this proposal is to characterize the genetic pathways that promote SIS. The principal investigator has shown that stress-induced sleep is dependent on Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor activation within the ALA neuroendocrine cell; however, the mechanism by which stress initiates EGF signaling is not known. The first aim of this project is to investigate how and, for the purposes of sleep regulation, in which tissues cellular stress is monitored. Because EGF family ligands are produced as transmembrane precursors that must be processed for release of soluble ligand, it is likely that EGF-dependent sleep is regulated by stress-induced ectodomain shedding. The second aim of this project is to determine from which cell(s) EGF is shed in response to stress, and to characterize a candidate protease that has been identified in an RNAi screen for sleep defects. The third and final aim of this project is to identify novel components of SIS via an unbiased forward genetic screen."
620000,"Nerves, the major communication pathways of our brain and spinal cord, are made of many individual communication fibers called axons. Each axon carries information from one single nerve cell (neuron). As an embryo develops, these fibers have to connect up correctly in order to make working neural circuits. Before these connections can form, the neurons have to move from the place they are born to the location where they will perform their role. Previously, the Principal Investigators have studied this process in the facial nerve, which controls facial expressions, and found that a single ""pioneer"" neuron guides the movement of the remaining neurons to their final destinations. Where do pioneer neurons come from, how do they know where to go, and how do other neurons know how to follow them? This project will address these questions in developing zebrafish embryos (animals with facial nerves similar to humans). Zebrafish embryos are transparent, and the experiments use specially-engineered zebrafish whose facial neurons are fluorescently labeled to make their cell migration visible. Experiments will also examine the roles of particular molecules found on the cell surface that are important for cell migration (cell adhesion molecules). A new kind of 3-dimensional imaging (light sheet microscopy) will be used to measure cell movements, and new software will be developed to visualize and analyze cell movement data. Once developed and tested at the University of Chicago and the Marine Biological Laboratory, these software tools will be made freely available. The project will additionally provide training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students; introduce elementary and middle school students to research; and engage the public via interactive displays at the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI).<br/><br/>Subsets of neurons migrate tangentially within the neuroepithelial plane, often over significant distances. To better understand mechanisms underlying tangential migration that are important for neural circuit formation, this project focuses on facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), which undergo a tangential migration that is conserved in vertebrates ranging from fishes to mammals. The study will utilize zebrafish embryos as they are accessible, transparent, and a powerful genetic model. Migrating FBMNs will be imaged in transparent zebrafish embryos with genetically marked cells, and tracked using light sheet microscopy. The Principal Investigator recently described the pioneer neuron as the first FBMN to migrate on each side of the hindbrain, and demonstrated the critical role of this neuron. Aim 1 will study the newly recognized pioneer neuron by establishing its cellular origins and tracking its subsequent trajectory through development. FBMN tangential migration also relies on interactions with two different pre-laid axon tracts and both interactions depend on adhesion molecule N-Cadherin. Aim 2 will investigate the role of N-Cadherin in mediating interactions between FBMNs and axon tracts, and whether it functions autonomously within neurons during migration. Additional adhesion molecules important for FBMN migration will be identified using RNAseq. An integral part of this project will be the development of new, broadly-applicable computational tools to analyze imaging data."
784948,"PI: Aaron P. Smith (Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College)<br/>Co-PI: Niranjan Baisakh (Louisiana State University Agricultural Center)<br/><br/><br/>Rice is a staple crop that feeds more than two billion people worldwide. Agricultural lands used for growing rice frequently contain sub-optimal nutrient levels. Low availability of two important nutrients, phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe), commonly limits crop productivity, whereas excess Fe can cause toxicity in rice grown under flooding conditions. Because of these growth restraints, plants modulate complex responses to fluctuating P and Fe levels via genome-wide transcriptional regulatory networks that involve numerous genes. DNA is found in the nucleus wrapped around histone proteins into structures known as nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin, which is a fluid, higher-order assembly that is modified by many remodeling complexes. Although chromatin structure plays a substantial role in controlling gene expression, the chromatin-level mechanisms involved in regulating nutrient homeostasis in plants are not well understood. Previous work has shown that the interaction between P and Fe influences the onset of deficiency-induced stress responses. The goal of this project is to identify chromatin-level mechanisms that regulate the uptake, assimilation, and utilization of P and Fe in rice. The four specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine the physiological and transcriptional changes in rice seedlings under P and/or Fe deficiency; 2) identify nutrient deficiency-dependent changes in nucleosome positioning across the rice genome; 3) examine the role of the H2A.Z histone variant in regulating gene expression in rice genome-wide; and 4) characterize the histone post-translational modifications present at rice P and Fe homeostasis genes during nutrient deficiency. By correlating three key components of chromatin structure (i.e. nucleosome positioning, histone variant localization, and histone modifications) with gene expression profiles, the regulatory mechanisms that modulate P and Fe deficiency responses will be revealed. Identifying these chromatin-level mechanisms will provide opportunities for developing crops with improved nutrient use-efficiency, significantly improving U.S. and global agriculture. All sequence data generated during this project will be made available to the public through the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the education of graduate and undergraduate students. The investigators have research groups diverse in ethnicity and gender, and will continue to foster involvement of underrepresented groups in research by mentoring students through programs available through LSU, including the Pre-doctoral Scholars Institute and Noyce Tigers Research Internship. Other planned activities include K-12 outreach through the annual Super Science Saturday event, and training of student-teacher pairs from area high schools in hands-on research for two weeks during the summer."
934500,"The selective synthesis of proteins is crucial for the ability of microorganisms to adapt to, and subsequently overcome, adverse environmental conditions. Exactly how protein biosynthesis is coupled to stress responses and virulence pathways in bacteria is not understood. BipA is a member of the translational family of GTPases and has been shown to be critical to the regulation of stress adaptation and pathogenic processes in microorganisms. Similar to other bacterial GTPases, the properties of this protein are determined by guanine nucleotide binding and exchange, as well as by association with the ribosome. An examination of the ribosome binding properties of BipA reveal an unanticipated linkage between BipA and guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), an alarmone responsible for adaptation to altered growth conditions in bacterial cells. Moreover, evidence suggests that BipA acts as an intermediary between the ribosome and the cellular environment and that its structural and regulatory properties influence how the ribosome responds to changing cellular conditions. This research involves using biochemical and biophysical techniques to understand how BipA accomplishes these tasks at the molecular level. There are at least two BipA ribosome complexes, 70S:BipA:GTP and 30S:BipA:ppGpp that exist in vivo. The first goal of this project is to use protein crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and other biophysical methods to determine the nature of these complexes, map the interaction surfaces between the various components and assess conformational changes resulting from binding and hydrolysis events on the local and global level. The second aim utilizes site directed mutagenesis, deletion analysis, fluorescence and hydrolysis assays to assess the contributions of intra- and inter-molecular interactions to the regulation and activities of BipA. Lastly, a variety of techniques will be employed to understand the biochemical and physiological consequences of the interactions involving ppGpp, BipA and the ribosome. Taken together, these studies will define BipA's molecular mechanism of action and provide a greater understanding of stress and virulence pathways in bacteria.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/>This project has the potential to transform our understanding of basic processes regulating protein synthesis, a fundamental process crucial to the ability of organisms to grow and respond to their environment. In addition, this CAREER award will support research and teaching activities at the intersection of biochemistry, biophysics, molecular genetics and microbiology. Emphasis has been placed on connecting biophysical techniques and microbiological processes especially in affording cross-disciplinary research opportunities for students at various stages of their educational careers. In addition, laboratory modules will be developed to introduce students to fundamental techniques in biophysics. These adaptable modules provide the basis of outreach programs connecting with local colleges and minority students."
886274,"This project will use three biodiversity manipulations at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve to test whether plant diversity (including genotypes within species, species with different functions, and species from different evolutionary lineages) can be detected remotely at multiple spatial scales. The study will measure biodiversity from the sky and space by remotely sensing the reflected light spectra of plants and investigate the consequences of biodiversity for ecosystem and global processes. Project scientists from four institutions will investigate linkages between plant biodiversity, soil microbe diversity and ecosystem function. These efforts will serve in the development of airborne and satellite platforms that can routinely monitor biodiversity and provide critical experimental evidence for the concept of surrogacy, i.e., that one metric of biodiversity can be used to provide information about others.<br/><br/>The project will transform methods for detecting changes in biodiversity worldwide and will provide numerous training opportunities in science, technology and math (STEM) for young scientists. Results will be integrated into the Cedar Creek Schoolyard Ecology program and a NASA-funded STEM Education Center to train Native American reservation teachers. Citizen scientists will be engaged through the MN Phenology Network. Data and research outcomes will be archived in publically accessible data repositories."
968953,"PI: Richard D. Vierstra (University of Wisconsin - Madison)<br/><br/>CoPI: Marisa S. Otegui (University of Wisconsin - Madison)<br/><br/>Plants employ sophisticated mechanisms to traffic and recycle intracellular constituents needed for growth and development, housekeeping, and survival under nutrient stress. One involves the sequestration of cytoplasmic material in autophagic vesicles and subsequent delivery of these vesicles to the vacuole for breakdown or storage. Prior work made substantial progress toward defining the mechanisms underpinning autophagy through molecular, genetic, and imaging analyses of a set of essential autophagy-related (ATG) components in both Arabidopsis and maize. Of relevance to agriculture were recent findings that autophagy is critical to nitrogen-use efficiency in maize and the discovery of a novel autophagic route that operates in maize seeds. The objectives of this project are to: (i) further define the maize ATG system at the biochemical and genetic levels; (ii) provide an integrated view of how autophagy impacts maize growth, development, and yield during nitrogen stress by combining atg mutants with phenotypic, cell biological, proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses; (iii) identify the cargo degraded by autophagy via proteomic characterizations of autophagic vesicles; and (iv) define the molecular mechanism underpinning ATG-independent autophagy during maize seed protein accumulation. Collectively, this research will provide the first systems view of autophagy in a crop plant and its role in nitrogen-use efficiency. More broadly, this research will also generate important reagents, techniques, mutants, transgenic lines, germplasm, and cargo catalogs that will provide a much needed foundation to appreciate autophagy in the important crop, maize. With such knowledge, it should be possible to re-engineer crops that more efficiently use nitrogen and other nutrients, that better remobilize these nutrients to areas of new growth and storage, that display improved leaf senescence and fruit ripening characteristics, and that provide better grain yields.<br/><br/>As a broader impact, this project is designed to provide an interdisciplinary vehicle for training the next generation of plant scientists using state-of-the-art genetic, proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and cell biological approaches to study crop physiology. Participants include research scientists, graduate students, and several undergraduates at Wisconsin or attending the UW-summer REU experience hosted by the Integrated Biological Sciences Summer Research Program, as well as high school students sponsored by the Wisconsin Youth Apprenticeship Program (YAP) in Biotechnology. YAP-Biotechnology is designed to expand the workforce in biological sciences by providing practical training to high school juniors and seniors through formal technology classes combined with real-life research experiences. Additional educational impacts involve cell biology workshops developed by the CoPI, who serves as the supervisor of the NSF-sponsored Plant Imaging Center, related to the next generation tomographic imaging techniques that will be refined during this project. Some of these refinements will be developed through an Introduction to Engineering Design course project organized by the UW-School of Engineering that will create devices optimized for imaging maize endosperms. Free and unencumbered public access to the RNA-seq, metabolomic, and proteomic datasets generated by this project will be facilitated by deposition of the data at MaizeGDB (http://www.maizegdb.org/) and the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) public repositories. Mutant germplasm and stable transgenic lines will be made available through the Maize Genetics Cooperative Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu)."
772208,"Many groups of animals and plants are very diverse and species rich but are closely related to a group of organisms that are not diverse and are species poor. Diversification can be a slow process or a rapid one, and the dynamics of why some groups become very diverse with hundreds of species, while others have just a few is an especially relevant field of study given a dynamically changing environment. Adaptive radiation theory predicts an increase in speciation rates resulting from adaptations in response to ecological opportunity, and that speciation rates are initially high, but decrease as ecological niches fill or extinction rates increase. Several iconic groups of animals have served as testing grounds for adaptive radiation theory, but few plant studies have focused on testing predictions of the theory. Penstemon (Plantaginaceae) is the largest plant genus native to North America, with nearly 300 species, and is an excellent example of a group that had undergone rapid diversification since the Pleistocene. Penstemon, diversified rapidly, with hundreds of species, during the Pleistocene when changing climatic conditions resulted in the melting of massive ice sheets covering much of the northern hemisphere. This research will study the effect of changing environment on organisms and how they adapt to climatic niches through speciation. The project will integrate systematics and bioinformatics training for graduate students and will result in open-source bioinformatics tools and web-based biodiversity data for the general public, scientists, and educators.<br/><br/>This project will generate next-generation sequencing data and develop novel species trees methods to test adaptive radiation theory in Penstemon. The project will generate next-generation targeted amplicon sequencing data from multiple loci, however handling the large volumes of data associated with collecting genomic data has been a technological challenge. To solve this issue the project will develop new methods of analyses to handle data sets with many taxa and large amounts of data and the project will develop a coalescent-based approach for estimating a species tree from multi-locus data. The species tree inferred will be used to examine rates of species diversification across the genus, specifically elucidating whether clades exhibit patterns consistent with those predicted by adaptive radiation theory. Morphological characters, ecological habitats, seed germination requirements, incidence of hybridization, and geographical data will be analyzed to determine if there are key innovations and/or ecological opportunities that may explain differences in speciation rates across the genus. Additionally, new methods of analyses will be developed for detecting patterns of hybridization in a genus that has a rapid rate of diversification."
749919,"An award has been made to Kansas State University (KSU) to establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program. The program will provide up to two-year research experiences in ecological genomics to five cohorts of scholars (six students per cohort) starting in spring 2011 and continuing through winter 2015. Each scholar will be paired with a faculty member linked to the KSU Ecological Genomics Institute, an intercollege research group whose research spans multiple levels in the biological hierarchy. EGI participants seek to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the short- and long-term organism responses to the natural environment. URM scholars will be integrated into EGI labs where they will develop early in their career (1) an appreciation for integrative scientific approaches to hypothesis based research, (2) critical thinking skills, and (3) a desire to continue their education in graduate level study. By the end of their tenure in the program, scholars will be well positioned for admission into highly competitive graduate programs in ecology and evolution. The KSU-URM program will include three main components: (1) a summer field course, (2) up to two years of independent research, mentored directly by faculty, (3) enhancement activities to foster cohort-building and networking, peer mentoring, communication skills building, ethics training, and career development, and (4) research presentations at professional meetings. Scholars will investigate a diversity of projects built around the expertise of the faculty mentors, including (1) the ecological and evolutionary genomics of adaptation, (2) speciation/hybridization, and evolutionary and comparative genomics, (3) genomics and ecology of species interactions, and (4) population and conservation genomics. Scholars will be selected based on an application packet, academic record, and the desire to create a diverse cohort of URM scholars that span the spectra of gender, racial, disability, and ethnic diversity.

580378,"Polyketides are one of the largest families of natural products with an astonishing structural variety and a remarkable range of biological activities. Polyketides are biosynthesized in fungi by polyketide synthase (PKS) multienzymes whose individual enzymatic domains are used repeatedly. While only a single PKS multienzyme is sufficient to produce most fungal polyketides, some of these natural products are assembled by two collaborating fungal PKSs. Such collaborations represent significant departures from the canonical biosynthetic logic of fungal polyketide biosynthesis. The overarching goal of the current project is to clarify the presently unknown molecular mechanistic details of the assembly of polyketides on such collaborating PKSs, using the biosynthesis of resorcylic acid lactones (RAL) and the related dihydroxybenzeneacetic acid lactones (DAL) as models. Specifically, the project aims to: 1: Characterize the biosynthesis of dehydrocurvularin, a DAL-type natural product; 2: Express RAL and DAL polyketide synthetases, their appropriate mutants, and hybrid enzymes in alternative microbial hosts, and evaluate the production of polyketides using these enzymes and synthetic substrates; and 3: Demonstrate combinatorial biosynthesis by combining related biosynthetic pathways. These experiments will clarify the programming rules that dictate the assembly of polyketides from simpler metabolites, and control the final shape (cyclization patterns) of such natural products. The lessons learned will advance our understanding of iterative enzymatic catalysis, and contribute to the development of combinatorial biosynthetic methods for the production of ""designer"" polyketides that may be used as novel agrochemicals or high value specialty chemicals in the future.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>Equally important, the project will incorporate training, education and outreach activities. Extensive research-based training opportunities will be provided to graduate and undergraduate students, including those from minority and underrepresented groups. The project will also train community college undergraduate student interns, and may host high school seniors as interns under the auspices of a successful outreach program of the University of Arizona. All students will learn the interdisciplinary science of microbial metabolite biosynthesis and the practice of combinatorial biosynthesis, thus preparing them for careers in the biotechnology industry and in academic research. Further, professional development opportunities will also be provided to K-12 educators to learn about natural products and their biosynthesis by microorganisms: this knowledge may later be integrated into their science curricula.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Metabolic Biochemistry Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division."
672037,"Protein degradation and disassembly of aggregates are critical quality control mechanisms for the maintenance of vital cellular functions. Powerful ring-shaped components of Clp macromolecular machines mediate these actions by using a protein threading mechanism, which consists of recognition, unfolding, and translocation of substrates through a central channel. Understanding the mechanism of these biological nanomachines, that carry out crucial cellular functions, represents an important challenge for modern biological studies. The objective of this CAREER project is to elucidate, using computer simulations, kinetic and thermodynamic requirements for protein unfolding and the operational principles of substrate translocation by the Clp nanomachines. These studies will pinpoint the effect of periodic forces on substrate protein unfolding and translocation and the details of interactions between substrates and Clp responsible for these actions. This project will advance understanding of other protein degradation machines and fundamental principles that govern protein unfolding and translocation.<br/><br/>This CAREER project combines interdisciplinary research in computational biophysical chemistry with education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in this field.

541173,"Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is emerging as a promising non-invasive imaging tool for fundamental studies of biological processes and structures, offering greater biochemical specificity, high temporal resolution, potential for concurrent intracellular and intravascular event measurement, and portability. Time-resolved NIR techniques allow explicit separation of optical absorption and scattering parameters related to biological structures, such as tissue, and (in theory) provide functional and metabolic information based on spectral and spatial imaging information. However, the visibility of superficial and deep structures remains fairly poor due to the lack of imaging sensor technology combining high-resolution spatial mapping, fast pixel response time, and broad spectral response. The goal of this CAREER program is to develop a new class of highly integrated wireless imaging sensors, combining photonic devices, broadband analog/RF circuits, and free-space optical communication to improve the spatial resolution of time-resolved NIR images; and establish an interdisciplinary educational environment for engineers. The long-term goal is to further expand the field of biological imaging by developing true mixed-mode integrated systems combining microwave, acoustic, photonic, and nanoscale electronic circuits for concurrent measurement of multiple imaging modalities to increase the visibility of sub-millimeter structures.<br/>This CAREER program reaches beyond current state-of-the-art to develop imaging sensors incorporating arrayed pixels for phase-sensitive optical detection at high frequencies. Motivated by the need to detect low level optical signals at high-speed, dielectrically-isolated avalanche photodiode structures implemented in digital CMOS technology and integrated at pixel-level with RF analog signal processing circuits will be explored. New approaches to low-noise front-end amplifier design will be explored to enable detection of RF-modulated optical signals at incident power levels below 1nW using chopper stabilization techniques and resonant circuit topologies. Process-variant tolerant (PVT) circuit topologies will be employed to ensure amplitude and phase accuracy within 0.1%. A two-dimensional sensor readout architecture incorporating pixel/column-level data converters and high-speed serial data readout will be developed. As a result of detailed environmental noise (substrate, power/ground supply) modeling and test structure measurement, a design methodology for arrayed high-frequency imaging sensors will be provided to design engineers. Pixel-level/column-level ADC architectures will be explored for optimal performance in terms of pixel form factor, power, and resolution. For the first time, wireless access based on optical transmission will be explored to enable remote data transfer from a wearable NIR imaging device.<br/>This synergistic research and education program will have significant broader impacts on in vivo characterization of macroscopic optical properties of multiply scattering tissues and enable development of new theories relating to biophysical mechanisms and correlations between signals generated by complementary imaging modalities (e.g. MRI). The portability of NIR imaging instrumentation is a key merit of the technology, and therefore, this research develops a wearable imaging system with integrated wireless capabilities enabling signal acquisition during movement. Interactive workshops with scientists and students will be organized to guide sensor development. The education program is tightly coupled to the research activities, including new undergraduate and graduate courses that vertically integrate topics from optical/electronic devices to circuits/systems and applications. A cross-campus undergraduate course on technical writing and communication will be developed in collaboration with Howard University to teach strategies in formulating and communicating technical ideas and engage students from under-represented groups in the CAREER program. The PI is committed to broadening opportunities to all engineers, including under-represented students. Workshops on graduate school admission, funding, and academic career opportunities will be organized during visits to minority serving institutions across the country. A complete wireless sensor module will be made available to researchers for experimental testing. Project outcomes and results, including educational materials, will be available to the public through a website (www.ece.tufts.edu/~vjoyner)."
929999,"Intellectual Merit<br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to understand how biological systems read and transform chemical signals into a diverse range of biological outputs. Improved descriptions of ligand-responses have implications from facilitating a general understanding of biological control to the design of regulatory systems with pre-defined activities, both of which have wide-spread uses in biomedical, engineering, environmental and biotechnological applications. How do ligand-responsive functions recognize the correct ligand structures, discriminate against incorrect ones and transform binding events into controlled responses? To better understand the functional roles of ligand interactions in regulatory systems, this project focuses on BmrR, a small molecule-sensing gene regulator whose activity is stimulated by a number of chemically diverse small-molecules. In the described work, biochemical, biophysical and X-ray crystallographic approaches are employed to dissect and examine ligand-directed effects at the binding, functional and structural levels. The aim is to combine functional, thermodynamic and structural studies into a more integrative analysis of ligand recognition and ligand-dependent control of protein conformation. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The broader impacts involve better connecting underrepresented minorities with the biological and physical science communities through mechanisms that target students at the elementary, high school and undergraduate levels. At the elementary and high school levels, these plans include continued involvement in Baltimore-based programs in which students and teachers in the area participate in science-based discussions, demonstrations and hands-on activities. The integrated research and educational plans focus on increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in basic science research and providing training opportunities for elementary, high school and graduate students."
1000000,"This CREATIV award is partially funded by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function and the Networks and Regulation Clusters in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences; the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics, the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. <br/><br/>The objective of this CREATIV project is to investigate the fundamental question of how intricate protein-based molecular machines can determine cellular-level dynamics for living systems. Specifically, the goal is to create a framework for quantitatively predicting functional consequences of designed changes in protein systems. This project will focus on the decision-making circuitry in Bacillus subtilis as a test case for the thesis that, although biology starts from the molecular scale, it is only at the cellular and multicellular scales that one sees life in action, as a distinct form of matter having goal oriented behavior. This is the level at which evolutionary selective pressures operate. It therefore must be the case that the dynamics at these higher-scales are directly determined by their molecular underpinnings. Exactly how this works has not yet been understood even for simple forms of life such as bacteria. Instead, quantitative systems-biology approaches today remain impoverished of molecular detail and one cannot hope for an understanding of either why things work the way they do, or, often more importantly, how we can intervene at the molecular scale to engineer the system performance. The PIs and their collaborators will apply an integrative approach that combines computational and experimental techniques to bridge this huge gap in our understanding and predictive capability of the quantitative functionality of biological systems. Recent progress on the Bacillus system has for the first time enabled this type of trans-scale approach. At the molecular level, advances in modeling and new ideas utilizing sequence-based data can effectively treat protein-protein interactions and conformational changes associated with chemical function. Cellular-level circuits that govern sporulation and competence have been the subject of much recent interest and there is in place an initial set of ideas regarding the logic implemented therein. Finally, the coupling between each cell's decision-making in overall colony structure is being vigorously studied. This research project is inherently multidisciplinary, combining protein chemistry with signal transduction, combining molecular biology and biophysics with complex pattern-formation physics, and combining non-equilibrium statistical mechanics with synthetic biology. This work is high risk and potentially high pay off. Molecular modelers have stayed away from making predictions as to how specific changes will be manifested at the scale of life, as this was considered to be too hard as compared to explaining in vitro biochemistry data. The results from this project would be transformative, changing how we approach the quantitative analysis of integrated biological systems. It is therefore highly appropriate for the NSF CREATIV program. <br/><br/>The basic knowledge generated from this CREATIV project will be crucial for revolutionizing our ability to control biofilms by molecular manipulation. Biofilm control is crucial for bacteria-based environmental remediation and for modern desalination. This project will provide a fertile ground to expose junior scientists to the challenge of cross-disciplinary research, both theoretical and experimental, which explicitly aims to break down the barriers between different subfields. This will lead to a future workforce better able to face the challenges of modern quantitative biology. Finally, bacterial colony structures and their cellular and molecular underpinnings are a fascinating area with which one can draw the public into contact with the ideas of modern science."
694550,"One of the biggest scientific problems of the past 50 years is how a protein folds into a stable 3-dimensional conformation critical for its function in the cell. While the process should be predictable from just the sequence of amino acids, one is still unable to make such a prediction. The most successful models of protein folding have been simple two- or three-state models. However, recent results from the PI's lab as well as others have shown these simple models to fail when examining fast folding kinetics in a variety of systems. The objective of this project is to further these preliminary studies by investigating different aspects of complexity in folding proteins using a variety of spectroscopic probes and state-of-the-art ultrarapid mixers. The experimental results will be compared with simulation results from various computational biology labs. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a theory which can predict the process solely from the amino acid sequence. By coupling theory and experiment on the microsecond timescale and considering the impact of complexity, this project will significantly advance the field of protein folding towards the long-term goal. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project encompasses aspects of structural biology, computation biology, optical spectroscopy and polymer physics. Therefore the students involved in this work will require cross-disciplinary training to accomplish the scientific goals. As part of a new graduate program in Quantitative Biology at MSU, the PI has designed new lecture and laboratory courses to introduce physical science students to biology and biology students to quantitative methods. These courses continue to evolve and the PI will also develop a course aimed at undergraduates in the life sciences to take a more quantitative approach to biology."
847300,"Intellectual Merit. Biological membranes surround all living cells, confine their internal organelles, and participate in an astounding variety of essential cellular functions, including extracellular signaling, electrolyte balance and energy conversion. These membranes are structurally and chemically heterogeneous environments composed of numerous types of lipids arranged as a continuous bilayer, in which membrane proteins are either embedded or surface-associated. The goal of this project is to understand the effect of the lipid bilayer on the structure and function of the membrane protein gamma-secretase. This protease is of great importance as it is responsible for activating numerous signaling molecules involved in the regulation of neuronal function, and its substrate specificity is thought to vary with the bilayer composition. Using novel assays the research will study the effect of physical and chemical parameters of the bilayer on secretase activity. To visualize the structure of the enzyme in a membrane it will be crystallized in lipid bilayers and analyzed using electron microscopy. This project constitutes a paradigm shift in membrane protein research as it moves away from commonly used artificial detergent systems to the study of membrane proteins in their natural lipid bilayer environment.<br/><br/>Broader impacts. By training scientists in membrane protein research and in the principles and applications of modern structural biology, this project will provide a platform for educating the next generation of scientists at the interface of biophysics, biochemistry and biology. The PI will continue to teach electron microscopy in a course available to students from all New York City institutions. Additionally, facilitating and encouraging minority participation in the sciences through teaching, mentoring and career counseling is a key goal of this project. This project will recruit students from various backgrounds at different career stages, through existing programs such as Post Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP), the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), and the precollege and collegiate programs of the Center for Excellence in Youth Education (CEYE). Emphasis will be placed on raising the scientific literacy of the public by ongoing outreach activities and by hosting one local high school student every year. This student will be chosen through an ongoing collaboration with the science faculty at Great Neck South HS."
630064,"In this project the PI is developing new multidimensional NMR spectroscopy techniques for the determination of three-dimensional protein structures in the solid phase. These NMR methods rely on the use of covalently-attached paramagnetic tags and exploit the large electron-nucleus hyperfine interactions to simultaneously obtain long, up to ~20 Å, electron-nucleus distance restraints at multiple protein sites. The principal research objectives of the project are: to develop methodology for the collection of paramagnetic-based NMR structural restraints with enhanced sensitivity, to develop methodology for probing the higher order intermolecular architecture of large protein assemblies, and to design compact paramagnetic tags to improve the quality of protein structures derived using this methodology. The paramagnetic solid-state NMR techniques emerging from this project are expected to be directly applicable to the structural analysis of a variety of large macromolecular assemblies that are central to fundamental biological processes yet do not readily lend themselves to characterization using traditional high-resolution structural tools.<br/><br/>The research aims of the project are integrated with education and outreach activities. The primary educational activity will consist of intensive, full-time summer research internship programs for undergraduate and local high-school students organized annually in the PI's laboratory. Student recruitment for these programs will focus particularly on students from groups traditionally under-represented in the STEM disciplines. The main objective of these activities is to directly impact students in the earliest stages of their educational experience by introducing them to cutting edge interdisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry, biology, and physics, building their confidence in themselves and their scientific abilities, and encouraging them to think of science in a broad, discovery-based manner. The ultimate goal is to increase student participation and retention in the STEM fields. This project is jointly supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division."
567935,"Carotenoids are naturally-occurring pigments that are essential for the survival of photosynthetic organisms. They act as protective devices against irreversible photodestruction of the photosynthetic apparatus, and they function as light-harvesting pigments. Despite this general knowledge of carotenoid behavior obtained from years of investigations, the excited state spectra and dynamics of these molecules are still not well understood. Many of the assignments of their energy states from spectroscopic data are controversial, and the precise nature of the excited states and the roles they play in controlling the biological functions of carotenoids remain unclear. The overall objective of the project is to elucidate the excited state spectra and dynamics of carotenoids in order to reveal how they carry out their important roles in nature. The planned experiments will analyze systematic series of polyenes and carotenoids obtained either synthetically or from several different photosynthetic organisms. In addition, recombinant proteins refolded with modified chlorophylls, or having undergone site-directed mutagenesis in the vicinity of protein-bound pigments, will be studied. Ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopic methods will be used to measure the spectra and dynamics of the excited states. The experiments will be augmented by theoretical quantum mechanical computations to reveal the excited state configurations which will be correlated with the spectroscopic observables. Kinetic and quantum mechanical models describing the photochemical behavior of carotenoids will be evaluated. Various hypotheses pertaining to the excited state structure and spectral properties of carotenoids will be tested, and a number of issues regarding how carotenoids function will be addressed.<br/><br/>Broader impacts<br/>The subject of the research has broad relevance to several socially important topics including global climate change, biofuels, and the development of alternative solar energy conversion schemes. A critical aspect of this project will be its impact on the training of undergraduate and graduate students which include those from underrepresented groups recruited though several outreach activities in which the PI will continue to participate. In the laboratory of the PI, the students will gain experience in a broad spectrum of experimental approaches including the techniques for the isolation and characterization of complex biological materials, sophisticated molecular spectroscopic methodologies, and kinetic and quantum computational modeling. The students will develop organizational and problemsolving skills by writing reports and publications and making presentations at scientific meetings to obtain valuable critical feedback from experts in the field. In addition, the PI will advance general understanding of the project by incorporating the subject matter directly into the freshman-level General Chemistry and graduate Biological and Physical Chemistry courses and through outreach activities involving the general public. The PI will be giving presentations at various schools where he will speak not only about the scientific content, but also about the broad social impacts of the project. The PI will continue his active role as a mentor in the NSF-sponsored REU program in the Department of Chemistry where a participating student will work directly on the project. Finally, the PI has established collaborative arrangements with internationally-known experts who will interact freely with the students in the group specifically on work related to this project, offer a global perspective on the work, and help bring the studies to fruition as rapidly as possible.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism and Chemistry of Life Processes programs in the Chemistry Division"
929999,"Intellectual Merit: Centromeres are the site on every chromosome of mammals where kinetochore assembly and spindle attachment occur during cell division. Faithful segregation of every chromosome relies on the proper functioning of centromeres, and errors in the cascade of events prior to and after spindle attachment lead to chromosome loss - a disastrous genetic fate. This research aims to understand the functional modules found within mammalian centromeres. A genetic process called molecular drive is thought to account for the observation that the DNA found at centromeres across all individuals within one species is highly similar, whereas a counter process called genetic conflict may be responsible for the observation that vastly different centromere satellite sequence suites are found between species. Accordingly, as satellite DNA arrays expand on a chromosome, they can attract more microtubules during female meiosis and lead to unequal transmission of one parental chromosome over the other. In a recently proposed model, this process, called Centromere Drive, results in the rapid evolution of centromere binding proteins selected to equalize the transmission of each chromosome during meiosis, ensuring all chromosomes are inherited equally in a population. Current models of centromere evolution and predict that different, but closely related species within a given species group would experience shifts and expansions of satellite sequences that would result in species-specific satellite sequences at centromeres. The well-documented evolutionary history of species of kangaroos and wallabies, along with the known history of the evolution of their chromosome complements, provides an ideal opportunity to test the Centromere Drive hypothesis directly, as opposed to the inferential studies that currently support this theory. In doing so, the functional components of centromeres that facilitate equal chromosome segregation will be uncovered. This project will determine whether satellite DNA interacting proteins evolve in concert with satellite sequence suites, as predicted by centromere drive, or with species divergence, as predicted by centromere drift and molecular drive. Inherent to this research will be efforts to determine whether the proposed conflict driven evolution of these components are responsible for hybrid incompatibilities and which components in the cell are the subject of drive. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This research involves a broad range of participants, including visiting faculty, post-graduate, undergraduate and high school students from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds in the New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island area. Undergraduate independent study students and high school students enrolled in the UConn Mentor Connection will be active participants throughout this research. Moreover, this research will serve as the foundation for development of three modular-format courses to provide training in utilization of massively parallel sequencing technology, which has revolutionized genome biology, but remains largely inaccessible to the individual scientist. Students will learn to prepare a library for sequencing, perform sequencing on the SOLiD sequencing platform and use bioinformatics to analyze the resulting data. The course will be open to advanced undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs and visiting high school teachers as part of the Professional Science Masters program in the Center for Applied Genetics and Technology. The inclusion of high school teachers as participants is part of the broader goals of this research in empowering educators to train both future generations of scientists as well as the future nonscientist members of the general public that will be directly impacted by shifts in genomic technologies."
671495,"The ability of mammalian cells to sense the density of the cells around them (quorum sensing) plays an important role in such fundamental processes as embryogenesis, proliferation and differentiation, and cell migration. Without quorum sensing a developing embryo would be unable to properly proportion its cells into different tissue types. Such control requires integrating secreted factors, signal transduction molecules, and cellular machinery. In mammals, the sheer number of players involved in these processes creates an unwieldy morass of interconnected proteins, making it difficult to study. This project is designed to untangle this snarl by using the social ameoba, Dictyostelium discoideum, as a model. Dictyostelium cells display many of the characteristics of mammalian cells, including, but not limited to, motility, differentiation, development and cell to cell signaling. Thus, this protist is an excellent model for mammalian cell behavior, especially quorum sensing. When starved, Dictyostelium cells will undergo a period of differentiation and development leading to the formation of a multicellular organism. However, this process will not begin unless there are sufficient numbers of starving cells to form a full sized organism. Therefore, these cells are able to sense the density of the starving cells around them and respond appropriately. This project will delineate how three signal transduction molecules (phospholipase Dbeta and the protein kinases TklA and PakD) work together to control changes in the actin cytoskeleton and the decision to develop. By uncovering the function of these proteins in Dictyostelium discoideum, a better understanding of their roles in quorum sensing in mammalian cells can be gained, and with it, a better understanding of their roles in development.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>This project advances discovery while promoting participation of underrepresented groups in the learning process, as Hunter College is a minority serving institution with a 60% female student body. Underrepresented students and one postdoctoral researcher will be actively engaged in designing, interpreting and presenting experiments. As part of this project, two lab modules designed to teach genetic analysis to Biology, Biochemistry and Neuroscience majors will be created, implemented and assessed. The postdoctoral researcher will help design the modules, train the lab instructors and teach students, enabling him to acquire skills in course creation, coordination and lecturing. These lab modules will be disseminated on-line to the broader teaching community (www.dictybase.org), extending the reach to those historically underrepresented in the sciences."
567115,"Intellectual Merit<br/>This project will study the chemical mechanism of protein splicing. Protein splicing is the means by which an intervening polypeptide, or intein, catalyzes its own removal from flanking polypeptides, or exteins. The intein also links the extein segments. The research project will investigate the following: 1. How the activity of an intein from an extreme thermophile is influenced by its unusual structural stability. The investigative approaches will examine how the intein balances the need to be stable at high temperatures with the need to be sufficiently flexible to be catalytically active; 2. The manner in which conserved residues in the intein catalyze each step of the reaction, providing insight into how enzymes catalyze and coordinate multi-step reactions at a single active site without cofactors; 3. The catalysis of cyclization of the amino acids asparagine or glutamine, coupled to peptide bond cleavage. This is an unusual reaction in protein chemistry which will be studied in the context of an intein as well as with a combination of model peptide experiments and computational modeling; 4. The regulation of intein activity, either by temperature or oxidation state. This process of regulation might suggest how inteins could control the activity of their flanking, interrupted proteins; 5. The autoprocessing of hedgehog-like domains, which resemble inteins in structure and sequence, including how conserved residues and the binding of cholesterol may influence the initial step of the reaction. These aspects of protein splicing will be investigated with the use of a combination of structural, biophysical, biochemical and computational techniques in projects suitable for undergraduates.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The research program will have a significant impact on the careers of undergraduate research students. The undergraduates will perform the experiments, present the results at national meetings and in peer-reviewed publications, and, through close mentoring, prepare to be future leaders in STEM. Students from the Biochemistry Concentration at the College of Holy Cross will be recruited to work on this project. In addition to research activities, the students will sponsor outreach in the community by hosting lectures aimed at broad audiences and by participating in the Science Ambassadors student outreach program. The project will broaden access to STEM by recruiting local students to the lab through the Worcester Pipeline which is a program that is conducted in conjunction with the University of Massachusetts Medical School"
511546,"Title: RUI: Atomistic Modeling of Membrane Proteins<br/><br/>Many proteins carry out their function within the environment of the cellular membrane. In this project, the investigator will use computer modeling to examine the effect of lipids on the structure and interactions of proteins contained within the cellular membrane. The membrane protein that will be the focus of this work is Rhodopsin, the protein involved in the first steps of the vision process and one that serves as a model for an important class of membrane proteins. Undergraduate students will be trained in this project. In addition to learning computer simulation methods, students will present their results to the campus community and at national and regional scientific meetings. These presentations will prepare them for careers as scientific researchers and will demonstrate exciting opportunities available to prospective science majors. All science majors at the institution will be impacted during undergraduate instruction through the transfer of molecular modeling techniques from the research laboratory to the chemistry curriculum.<br/><br/>The primary research tool for this investigation is molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation. Specific projects include: (1) studies of lipid mediated protein-protein interaction as a function of lipid type with a focus on polyunsaturation, (2) characterization of the annulus of lipids associated with transmembrane proteins in terms of structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic parameters, (3) investigation of retinal-opsin interactions as a function of the Rhodopsin photocycle to understand the extent of reciprocal control between protein and ligand, and (4) refinement of the CHARMM force field for modified retinal ligands to support investigations of their role as agonists.

664493,"Intellectual Merit <br/>Living cells have an inside and an outside, separated by a barrier called the cell membrane, primarily made of fundamental units called lipids. Molecules (such as salts, ions, polar molecules) that are happy (energetically stable) in water are not always happy in a membrane-like environment. Surprisingly, however, numerous water-loving molecules are found in the membrane or are known to cross the membrane environment quite easily. Cell penetrating peptides are observed to readily enter cells. Since water-loving molecules appear to reside within and transfer through the cell membrane, it is natural to think that water goes along for the ride. Water has an important role in these processes. Since it is impossible to see individual water molecules with laboratory experiments, computer programs will be used to perform what are known as molecular simulations. These computational methods, incorporating mathematical descriptions of the physics of how biological molecules interact with one another, follow the motions of individual molecules in time and space. This allows researchers to explore the role of water associated with cell membranes (bilayers) in the transfer of polar and charged molecules through this environment. The view is at the atomic and molecular level! Novel methods will be used that have been developed to describe the varying molecular properties of water and permeating molecules as they move through sharply different environments. The research will address the interaction between water and lipids in the membrane. Specifically, does the water present in the local environment of the permeating molecule support structural changes of the membrane that stabilize the molecule in the ""oily"" lipid region? More broadly, understanding the role of water in differing environments has implications in numerous scientific and technological contexts (water-mediated self-assembly of nanoparticles, colloidal suspensions and their role in the environment, etc.), thus furthering our global understanding of this ubiquitous solvent and its behavior across different scientifically and technologically important chemical environments. Application of these novel methods on new computer hardware such as Graphical Processing Units (GPU's) that are now becoming viable commodity high-performance computing alternatives for routine computing will be continued.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Motivated by the inescapable current and future requirement for cooperation between the quantitative and qualitative scientific disciplines to further our understanding of fundamental biophysical and biochemical processes, two educational/outreach goals will be established. 1). A multi-disciplinary team consisting of a university professor and two veteran teachers (of chemistry/physics and biology) will introduce students at Newark High School (NHS; which serves a substantial population of minority students and groups underrepresented in science, technology, and engineering) to an introductory computational chemistry course that will emphasize a philosophy of multi-disciplinary approaches, combining the skill sets, tools, and knowledge of the fields of chemistry, biology, physics, math, and computer science, to understanding fundamental biophysical phenomena. This will expose students to practical computer tools and skills widely used in academia and industry. 2). To support the mathematics preparedness of undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry students at the University of Delaware, and to spark greater student interest in the pursuit of research in such fields as biophysics, chemical physics, and computational sciences, an introductory computational chemistry course will be developed, using state-of-the-art computers and programs, focusing on mathematics of chemistry to solve problems of a chemical nature and to prepare students for the mathematical rigor of Physical Chemistry courses. Such extra preparation and opportunities for chemistry students to sharpen their basic math skills will make Physical Chemistry a less burdensome, more enriching (and perhaps fun) experience for students. Project goals serve to increase students' quantitative reasoning skills at an early point in their careers, thus establishing a firm platform from which to pursue numerous avenues of research relevant to future societal needs."
633041,"Abstract:<br/><br/>Scientific merit: Long timescale conformational fluctuations can be responsible for unusual protein electrostatic effects and remote modulation of enzymatic reactions. Due to the timescale limitation, accurate understanding of these events via computer simulation has been very challenging. The goal of this research is to develop and apply novel molecular dynamics simulation methods to quantitatively describe complex biomolecular phenomena that usually occur in much longer timescales than what conventional techniques can achieve. In this project, specialized computer simulation algorithms will be developed and employed to enhance the sampling power of biomolecular simulations. Specifically, the main objectives will be accomplished in two focused areas: (1) Quantitative prediction of protein electrostatic effects and understanding their coupling with protein conformational transitions; (2) Understanding how slow enzyme fluctuations prepare unique catalytic environments to activate chemical reactions. These studies will provide deeper understanding of the roles that protein conformational changes play in key biological processes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The computer simulation methods under development will be distributed to general scientific community. Some specific algorithms will very possibly become major techniques in related research areas. The success of this research will motivate more problem-oriented sampling design efforts in the field of biomolecular simulation. Synergistic with the scientific project, a special graduate course ""Time-scale and Length-scale in Biology"" will be further developed. National and international meetings and workshops will continue to be organized by the author to motivate and catalyze the education of younger-generation scientists on the subject of quantitative computational biophysics. Efforts will continue in the involvement of undergraduate students and high school students in this research, using computer simulations to explore protein structures, dynamics, and functions."
708621,"Intellectual Merit. <br/>The acetoacetate decarboxylase-like superfamily (ADCSF) is a new and largely unexplored group of en-zymes that may be a source of new ""green chemistry"" biocatalysts. The long-term goal of this project is to define the structural features responsible for reaction and substrate specificity in selected ADCSF enzymes with potential as useful biocatalysts in research or industrial settings. With this knowledge, it may ultimately be possible to engineer these enzymes for specific applications. The objective of this work is to determine the mechanisms of catalysis and substrate specificity in the ADCSF enzymes Sbi_00515 from Streptomyces bingchenggensis and Swit_4259 from Sphingomonas wittichii. Our central hypothesis is that both enzymes are hydratase-aldolases, catalyzing the formation or breakdown of alpha-keto acids using a mechanism involving a lysine Schiff base. The rationale for these experiments is that, since these two enzymes do not have decarboxylase activity, the acetoacetate decarboxylase structure must have been adapted to perform other catalytic functions. A thorough understanding of the structural aspects that determine reaction specificity will not only facilitate efforts to engineer these enzymes as biocatalysts, but will also broaden our understanding of the relationship between enzyme structure and function. These objectives will be attained by pursuing the following specific aims. First, the preferred substrate and catalytic mechanism of the putative hydratase-aldolase Sbi_00515 will be determined. Sbi_00515 will be screened for activity against a panel of potential substrates. These kinetic experiments will be supported by structural studies of the enzyme with potential substrates bound. Transient and steady state kinetics on wild-type and mutant forms of Sbi_00515, together with kinetic isotope effects, will be used to probe the catalytic mechanism. Second, the reaction catalyzed by Swit_4259 will be defined, and structural features favoring C-C bond breaking or formation will be identified. X-Ray crystallography, steady-state kinetics, and bioinformatics approaches will be used to characterize the interaction of Swit_4259 with candidate substrates. The observation of significant differences between the Swit_4259 and Sbi_00515 active sites suggests that the two enzymes have different substrate specificities and may catalyze different reactions. Comparisons of the structures of unliganded and substrate-bound forms of both enzymes should allow us to discern relationships between structure and function in these enzymes. This work is original, because it will expand the ADCSF field beyond the few decarboxylases studied thus far. Due to the dearth of research on this superfamily, it is virtually impossible to predict the functions of family members discovered by genome mining. The outcomes of the research will be detailed mechanistic information about Sbi_00515-catalyzed aldol condensation and cofactor-independent dehydration, which will help us understand how evolution has modified the decarboxylase scaffold to perform a new catalytic function. It is also expected that the principal determinants of substrate specificity will be identified, which will facilitate subsequent work aimed at engineering Sbi_00515 and Swit_4259 to produce alpha-keto acids with tailored side chains. These outcomes will have a positive impact by expanding and helping to define the burgeoning ADCSF field, as well as improving the ability of researchers to more accurately predict the functions of ADCSF enzymes identified by genome sequencing.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. <br/>This project will use a number of strategies to promote teaching, training and learning. First, the PI's group has an established record of including undergraduates in research projects. The structural enzymology work proposed is readily divided into semester-long sub-projects that allow undergraduates to make significant contributions to the progress of the research. The PI will also incorporate actual research data into the two courses he teaches each year, both of which are primarily undergraduate offerings. These data will be used to illustrate principles of data interpretation, as well as fundamental aspects of protein structure and function. Particular attention will be paid to the overall development of the graduate students and postdoctoral scholars funded by this proposal, not only as researchers, but as fully-integrated members of the scientific community. In order to achieve this goal, all trainees will receive instruction in both written and oral presentation of research results, academic integrity, and professional development. To maximize the number of students who will benefit from the proposed research, the PI is participating in the ""Students Modeling a Research Topic"" (SMART) program offered through the Milwaukee School of Engineering. SMART Teams introduce 10th-12th graders to structural biology as they work in collaboration with their teacher and faculty research mentor. Finally, the PI will disseminate the results of the research not only to the scientific community, but also the general public through a series of podcasts. Thus, the research will have positive social impact, applied benefits, and advance the ADCSF field."
860016,"Intellectual Merit<br/>RNA functions as the central conduit for information in living systems. RNA molecules encode genetic information and also serve as critical component in the catalytic and regulatory machinery in cells. In one example, the ribosome is a finely tuned machine that translates the information coded in messenger RNA into proteins. The ribosome contains two large RNA molecules and many proteins and the function of this essential cellular machine is governed by complex structural and dynamic interactions among its protein and RNA components. In a second example, RNA viruses represent perhaps the most successful replicating entities in our biosphere. Almost every step in RNA virus replication involves highly evolved interactions between their RNA genome and viral and cellular proteins. Extraordinary progress in understanding the ribosome and RNA viruses has been made based on genetic, biochemical, and high-resolution structure approaches. However, the impact of the cellular environment on RNA function remains poorly understood. The overarching vision of this project is to make the SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) RNA structure analysis technology a robust tool for analysis of RNA structure in cells and inside viral particles. The specific research goals over five years of the project are to use SHAPE to establish the structure of E. coli ribosomal RNA during protein synthesis in healthy, growing cells and to determine the RNA genome structure of an icosahedral plus-strand virus to reveal broad principles of viral RNA genome packaging.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/> Accurate and efficient technology for analyzing RNA structure inside cells has the potential to transform many fields in the biological sciences. When fully developed, SHAPE technology will allow synthesis of information obtained from high-resolution structural approaches in highly purified systems with function and fitness studies in cells. SHAPE technology is also sufficiently mature to serve as the basis for a completely undergraduate-driven research endeavor, the Undergraduate Transcriptome Project (the UTP). Undergraduates will, independently, carry out the research on viral RNA genome packaging. The UTP is designed to help undergraduates explore their potential for independent creativity, to fuel their passion for science, to promote high-level mentoring by graduate students, and to be a model for engaging undergraduates in a research university."
590224,"A fundamental problem in biochemistry is to understand how enzymes work. This project seeks greater insight into how nature designs enzyme active sites, particularly the residues that are not in direct contact with the reacting substrate molecule(s). Structural and biochemical studies have now characterized the active sites of hundreds of enzymes, and nearly all of these studies have focused on the amino acids in direct contact with the reacting substrate; these residues may be regarded as the first layer of the active site. Recent theoretical predictions and experimental studies strongly suggest that residues outside the first layer of the active site can also be very important for catalysis. The goals of this project are to combine theory, computation, and experiment to establish the prevalence of spatially extended active sites in enzymes, to show that this phenomenon is predictable computationally, and to elucidate the mechanisms by which spatially remote residues participate in enzyme catalysis. One such mechanism, and a problem of intense current interest, is the role of protein dynamics in the catalytic process. The examples studied here have been chosen because they have different kinds of interesting dynamical processes in play. In DNA polymerase III, motions in the polymerase subunit modulate DNA binding and are likely responsible for checking the fidelity of base-pair formation. For ornithine transcarbamylase, an induced fit conformational change has been reported to occur with the binding of the first reactant molecule. For glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase, a pH-dependent molecular switch has been proposed for a coil-to-helix transition that activates the catalytic site. Preliminary evidence suggests that residues outside the first shell play central roles in each of these processes. For these three enzymes, mutations will be made at positions in the second and third shells that are predicted computationally to be important for catalysis, and these mutants will be characterized kinetically and structurally. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be performed on the wild type and variants to determine whether the mutations affect the dynamics of the protein, and whether this motion contributes to catalysis, predictions that will be tested experimentally using wide-angle x-ray solution (WAXS) scattering. The establishment of principles governing remote residue participation in enzyme catalysis, and evidence that such participation is predictable computationally, will be very useful for enzyme engineering and mechanistic studies. <br/><br/>The computational methods developed for this project will be made freely available to the scientific community via the web for use in research, including protein engineering and enzyme mechanism studies, and in commercial applications. This project will provide better understanding of nature's design of enzyme active sites and of how enzymes affect catalysis. Such improved understanding can help in the development of novel technologies, such as cleaner, ""green"" industrial processes, sustainable methods for environmental remediation, and enzymatic biofuel synthesis. The training of highly qualified scientists as described in this project is vital to the regional high-tech economy and to U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. Two doctoral students will be trained in computational methods, in protein expression, mutation, purification, kinetics and binding assays, crystal structure determination, and other x-ray scattering methods. Parts of the project will be integrated into the Molecular Modeling course, with active student participation in some of the computational and modeling work. Research participation by undergraduate students will continue. This project will continue current collaborations with faculty members at primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), including a Hispanic-serving PUI. Hands-on demonstrations of computational and other research tools will continue at PUIs and to inner city K-12 students. Extensive participation by project team members in Native American student, professional, and community groups will continue."
603000,"Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>Fast changes in the structure of a protein on photoexcitation have implications for the elucidation of many important processes in nature, such as photosynthesis and other photo-induced chemical reactions in proteins. Changes accompanying protein crystallization can be experimentally followed by the technique of time-resolved X-ray crystallography, which involves the measurement and indexing of Bragg spots. However, not all proteins (particularly membrane proteins) involved in many of the crucial processes of life, form crystals. In addition, reactions undergone by proteins in a crystal may not mirror those of proteins in living systems. As such, an ability to study experimentally photo-induced chemical reactions of proteins in solution would constitute a significant breakthrough. The objective of this project is to develop a valid theoretical method for extracting structural information from a pump-probe experiment designed to follow structural changes of single molecules immediately after photoexcitation. This project will demonstrate this capability through measurements of diffuse diffraction patterns from an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). The diffraction pattern will be obtained from a sample of liquid droplets, containing ensembles of identical proteins, before and after photoexcitation. The photoexciting beam will be a laser, synchronized with the XFEL pulses, which will excite the molecules a short time before they are interrogated by the XFEL beam. The ability to take advantage of larger signals from ensembles of molecules will be developed, for ensembles of randomly oriented molecules, by the evaluation of angular correlations of the diffraction data. The idea will be demonstrated initially with data from computer simulations of such diffraction patterns and followed by demonstrations with measured experimental diffraction patterns. The latter work will involve collaboration with Prof. John Spence of Arizona State University, who has experience of protein structure work with the XFEL at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) in Stanford, CA. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>Undergraduates recruited with the help of the UW-Milwaukee's undergraduate research opportunity program (UROP) will be integrated into the research efforts. Cutting-edge techniques of structural biology will be introduced into high-school classrooms with the help of K-12 teachers recruited to the campus by the UW-Milwaukee's NSF-funded research experience for teachers (RET) program. Teachers will first participate in research efforts with the principal investigators and transfer what they learn into their classrooms. A newly designed web-page will increase the visibility and impact of the research efforts."
500367,"Abstract:<br/><br/>Scientific Merit: Thermophilic proteins, primarily extracted from organisms that thrive at very high temperatures, denature at significantly higher temperatures than mesophilic proteins from organisms that live at moderate temperatures. One of the long-standing questions in protein science has been: How do selective pressures, such as environmental temperature, impinge on the evolution of thermal tolerance in proteins? With the advent of proteomic and systems level studies that encompass the complete set of proteins in an organism, the question becomes yet more remarkable: How do cells grown at high temperatures adapt their entire collection of proteins? While existing studies are on individual sets of proteins, several experimental data characterizing different proteomes demand new theoretical modeling and detailed analysis at a much larger scale to unravel broad scale adaptive strategies that different organisms may have utilized to withstand such temperature extremities. Such large scale detailed modeling of numerous proteins will be combined with experimental observations as part of this project. The novel multi-scale research will enable computation of several important, hard to measure, yet analyzed biophysical quantities that are central to protein function and stability, ultimately dictating biology. Thus the relationship of microscopic structural features to protein thermodynamics on a global scale will provide essential clues to protein evolution and engineering.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The project will impact multiple outreach efforts and new initiatives for education. Concepts of protein science, directly related to this work will be integrated in these outreach activities by incorporating in class material, workshop, engaging demonstrations for general public awareness. Graduate curricula and courses will be designed for the newly launched Molecular and Cellular Biophysics doctoral program at the University of Denver in which quantitative modeling in biology including concepts of protein folding, stability and evolution, will be showcased. Simple concepts derived from this research in the form of puzzles, animations and posters will be demonstrated at the science awareness night at the Elitch Garden amusement park, attended by high school students and teachers. This amusement park has a broad appeal across ethnic groups and income levels, and reaches audiences underserved by more traditional outreach methods. These concepts will also be integrated in a short-term training workshop for secondary educators from local schools. Undergraduate students at the University of Denver will carry out parts of the proposal for their senior theses, for which they will be further trained in scientific writing and presentation skills. Results of the research, and codes developed to interpret experimental data will be made freely available online to the global protein science community. Besides immediate impact on protein science, the research will also impact design of new enzymes relevant in protein pharmaceuticals as well as biosynthesis of renewable energy carriers."
1000000,"Internal protein motion has long been thought to be dependent on the solvation environment. Though the detailed interactions between solvent water and protein have been extensively studied computationally, experimentally derived site-resolved information on this critical interaction is severely lacking. This research project seeks to help fill this void. The first objective is to directly detect and localize long-lived waters of hydration of proteins. Reverse micelles will be used to encapsulate individual protein molecules. Reverse micelles are spontaneously organized assemblies of surfactant and water molecules that form nanoscale sequestered water pools. Proteins can now be readily incorporated into this water pool with high structural fidelity. High-resolution NMR will then be employed to directly measure protein-water interactions. Encapsulation of proteins greatly simplifies the interpretation of the results. The second objective is to determine the effect of confinement and the concomitant slowed water dynamics on the internal motion of the proteins. The protein backbone and side chain dynamics under nano-confinement will be characterized using NMR relaxation methods. Over the past decade, the necessary technology and expertise have been developed to make encapsulation of proteins for high resolution NMR characterization possible. These systems thus serve as a mimic of the confined spaces of the cell and are exploited here to answer several pressing questions including the degree and type of coupling between solvent motion, which is slowed in the reverse micelle, and internal protein motion. <br/><br/>The work will be carried out at the University of Pennsylvania with the participation of postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students and high school students from the region. This laboratory has a significant history of involvement in cutting edge research by undergraduate and high school students. In addition, the postdoctoral associate affiliated with this project is actively engaged in the iPRAXIS program in Philadelphia designed to nurture the participation of under-represented minorities in the sciences. Both he and the PI are continuing this interaction during the current research effort. The results of this work will be disseminated in high profile journals and presented at international and national meetings providing significant exposure not only for the scientific product itself but also for those who have generated it. Indeed, postdoctoral associates, graduate students and undergraduates participating in this research have traveled to major international meetings to present their work. In addition, the PI has in the recent past organized international meetings that resonate with the central themes of this research program and will do so in the future. Finally, this work rests on an emerging technology - NMR spectroscopy of encapsulated proteins in low viscosity fluids. This research effort will more widely illustrate the utility and capabilities of this approach and thereby continue to bring a new and innovative technology to the biophysical community."
833000,"Intellectual Merit: <br/>There are two major accomplishments associated with this project: (a) Developing copper-based pulsed ESR experiments with the aim of generalizing the technique to proteins that do not normally bind metals, achieving up to a three-fold enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio through double quantum coherence (DQC) methods for paramagnetic metal ions and exploiting such techniques to learn about the packing of the side chain that is typically used to spin label proteins. The distance measurement methodology will have a significant impact on the ability to understand structure-function relationships in proteins that cannot be studied by traditional biophysical methods. A series of distance constraints between copper(II) centers site-selectively labeled on a protein, X-ray structures and molecular modeling will provide detailed insights into the packing and flexibility of side chains used to place paramagnetic metal ions at selected sites in proteins. Such information will be especially important for paramagnetic relaxation enhancement based structure determinations in NMR. (b) Probe the relationships among structure, protein dynamics, and thermodynamics in the restriction endonuclease EcoRI to adduce general principles of site-specific protein-DNA recognition. Pulse-ESR distance methods (both DEER and DQC) and X-band and W-band continuous wave ESR spectroscopy will be applied to study the differences in dynamics and distance distributions between complexes of EcoRI endonuclease bound to specific, miscognate (one incorrect base pair) and nonspecific DNA sites. A newly acquired W-band ESR spectrometer greatly enhances the ability to distinguish protein backbone dynamics from motions of the spin label and provides the exciting opportunity to characterize motions on the sub-nanosecond timescale. This will be one of the first examinations of how ESR-based dynamic parameters differ not only at different locations within a macromolecular complex, but also at corresponding locations in a set of related recognition complexes. Such comparative measurements will provide information on how microscopic differences in structure and dynamics contribute to macroscopic differences in thermodynamic parameters. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>Six to eight undergraduate researchers and two to three graduate students working on this project will be trained at the interdisciplinary interface between chemistry and biophysics. The PI will seek to recruit undergraduates from 4-year colleges by actively presenting research at those institutes. Workshops will be organized for high-school teachers, in the Pittsburgh area, to orient them with this research as well as provide modules for use in high school curricula. Workshops for high school students will expose them to careers in Chemistry. Software for the extraction of distances from metal-based ESR data will be disseminated. Two women will be trained in ESR as part of the support from this project. Research ideas and themes developed in the project will be used to modernize the undergraduate Physical Chemistry course. This initiative is in line with the American Chemical Society's call for the incorporation of interdisciplinary and integrative trends of chemical research into undergraduate curricula without the creation of new course work."
791000,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Sulfur reduction is central to life as a vestigial reminder of Earth before the emergence of an oxygen-based energy currency. Organic sulfur in the form of sulfide remains an essential nutrient in all organisms, but higher eukaryotes are unable to reduce inorganic sulfur(IV) so rely on bacteria, archaea, yeast, and plants to produce useable sulfur. The six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide is central to the bio-geo sulfur cycle and is catalyzed by a single enzyme, sulfite reductase (SiR). This ""high-volume"" electron transfer is unique to sulfur and nitrogen cycles and represents one powerful example of a biochemical reaction where nature is more versatile than human chemical engineers. Together, the centrality of SiR to nutrient cycles and its unique biochemistry make a compelling case that research into its mechanism and structure lays important groundwork for understanding our natural environment.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to experimentally dissect the chemistry and biology of electron transfer in sulfur reduction by the oxidoreductase SiR and to broaden the impact of this research through integrated educational outreach in the laboratory and classroom. Experimental results will advance knowledge about mechanisms of sulfur reduction by combining information at multiple resolutions from x-ray crystallography and single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) with biochemical analysis. Specifically, two areas are under investigation. First, the role of specific amino acids in SiR activity will be probed with mutagenesis, SiR activity assays, and x-ray crystallographic structural analysis. Second, the SiR subunit assembly will be explored, with multi-angled light scattering, cryo-EM imaging, and single particle 3DEM analysis, to understand inter-protein chemistry that drives sulfur reduction,. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Applying structural techniques to answer fundamental questions about environmental bacteriology benefits society at large by providing insight into the mechanisms that regulate the biogeological cycling of sulfur. In addition, exploring sulfur reduction pathways provides a unique platform for integrating research and teaching. The proposed outreach component uses multifaceted classroom exercises based on hypothesis-driven research to engage a range of students. Specifically, students from high school to postdoctoral researchers will be targeted to join the laboratory where they will be exposed to research in structural biology. Florida State University is home to one of approximately 20 Titan Krios cryogenic transmission electron microscopes worldwide and training on this unique instrument is integral to the proposed research. Further, the applied structural techniques rely on diverse tools from computation, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, and microbiology, providing a range of potential research projects with a common focus on answering biological questions. At the same time, active-learning modules developed specifically for a first year Introduction to Biology class at Florida State University will reinforce and enhance classroom lessons on biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology and cellular biology. SiR is an engaging, effective foundation for classroom exercises because it is a novel model to explain basic life science concepts not explored in most lecture courses or textbooks. These classroom modules developed with, and for, students aspiring to teach K-12 science and technology further broadens the long-term impact of this proposal on improving general science education in the United States."
897637,"Co-PIs: Anna Stepanova (Plant and Microbial Biology, North Carolina State University), Steffen Heber (Computer Science, North Carolina State University), Cranos Williams (Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University)<br/><br/>Unlike animals that can seek shelter to escape from bad weather, plants cannot move and must spend their entire lives in one place, rain or shine. Plants are able to adapt to challenging conditions by adjusting how they grow and how much nutrients they take in from the environment. Understanding these adjustments of plants in response to environmental challenge is important for a basic understanding of how plants may respond in rapidly changing environments, and will yield insights about ways to increase agricultural production to support a fast growing human population. Basic research suggests that plants, like animals, use a small set of signaling chemicals, hormones, to sense the environment, and to control their metabolism and growth. Since hormones play such a key role in regulating plant development and responses to the environment, it is important to identify the main 'genetic hubs', where environmental signals and hormonal changes are integrated in order to control a plant's life. This basic scientific knowledge will improve our understanding of how plants grow and react to stress and will help in the development of new crop varieties that perform well under extreme conditions. Traditionally scientists have studied how hormones influence gene activity by examining gene expression by measuring the copying of DNA into RNA, the first step in the transfer of genetic information into proteins, which play an enormous variety of functional roles in cells. However, an increase in expression does not always mean that more protein will be made because protein production from encoded RNA molecules is a highly regulated process. Fortunately, the recently developed Ribo-seq technology provides the capability of measuring protein production by every active gene in the genome at once. By using this technology, 'genetic hubs' that connect environmental sensing with the control of plant growth can be uncovered. Understanding how these hubs work at the molecular level will add new tools to the ""biotechnological toolbox"" that scientists can then use to develop better and more resilient crops.<br/><br/>Genome-wide changes in translation activity in response to ethylene have been quantified at codon resolution by taking advantage of the recently developed ribosome footprinting technology, making it possible to identify new translational regulatory elements in Arabidopsis. Importantly, detailed characterization of one of the novel regulatory elements indicates that regulation of translation is not miRNA dependent, and that the element identified is also responsive to the plant hormone auxin, implicating this element in the interaction between ethylene and auxin. These findings not only confirm the basic biological importance of translational regulation and its potential as a signal integration mechanism, but also open new avenues for identifying, characterizing and utilizing additional regulatory modules of gene expression in plant species of economic importance. Towards that goal, a plant-optimized ribosome footprinting methodology will be deployed to examine the translation landscape of two plant species, tomato and Arabidopsis, in response to two plant hormones, ethylene and auxin. A time-course experiment will be performed to maximize the detection sensitivity and diversity (early vs. late activation) of translational regulatory elements. The resulting data, reflecting temporal changes, will be used to generate hierarchical transcriptional and translational interaction network models for the two hormones, and to identify key regulatory nodes. Finally, the comparison between two plant species will provide critical information about conservation of the regulatory elements, thereby informing research on future practical applications. All the sequence data will be made publicly available through the NCBI-SRA. All biological materials and genomic data will be available through a dedicated project website at brcwebportal.cos.ncsu.edu/plantriboprints). In addition, software and contents of the genome browser will be deposited at iPlant to ensure long-term public access. Arabidopsis seeds and DNA constructs will be deposited at the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. A new outreach program to promote interest among middle- and high-school kids in combining biology, computers, and engineering will be developed. A web-based bilingual dissemination tool, Plants4Teens, as well as live monthly demos at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and local schools, will be implemented in this new outreach program. Examples of demonstration modules will include comparisons between simple electronic and genetic circuits."
539999,"The native state of a protein is the structure that is most thermodynamically stable and is normally the biologically active form. Protein folding begins from a less structured collection of states, commonly known as the denatured state ensemble (DSE). The DSE is considerably harder to study than the native state owing to its dynamic and flexible nature, and to the fact that the vast majority of protein molecules populate the native state under normal conditions. Nevertheless, understanding the DSE is fundamentally important for understanding of protein folding and stability. The stability of a protein is dictated by the free energy difference between the native state and the DSE, thus any changes in solution conditions or mutations that alter the DSE can alter stability and folding. The DSE is the reference state for stability measurements; much of our quantitative understanding of the specific interactions involved in stabilizing the native state of proteins is derived from experiments that make implicit assumptions about the DSE. In addition, the DSE can be the starting state for nonproductive protein aggregation, a process that impacts biotechnology and biology. This project is directed at fundamental studies of protein folding, focusing on the role of the DSE. A deeper understanding of the properties of the DSE and the role that the DSE plays in folding is required for a complete description of protein folding and aggregation. The DSE can be populated under harsh, non-physiological conditions, but progress requires characterization of the DSE under conditions that are relevant for folding and aggregation, i.e., under conditions where the native state is stable. Comparative experimental studies of a set of three representative model proteins will be carried out under physiologically relevant designed conditions. The experimental work will be closely integrated with efforts by theoretical collaborators. <br/><br/>A range of educational and outreach activities are planned. An 'adopt a lab' program has been initiated as part of the first year undergraduate honors lab class and will be further developed. Interactions with Stony Brook University?s project WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) program will be established to provide support and encouragement to undergraduate women who are interested in science and engineering. Laboratory exercises will also be designed to interface with project WISE. Graduate and undergraduate training and mentoring are key components of the project. Outreach activities include visits and seminars at undergraduate institutions, as well as collaborations with researchers at primarily undergraduate institutions. The research goals of the project aim to answer fundamental questions in protein folding. As part of the work, new tools and methodologies will also be developed which can be applied to a range of problems in protein structure and dynamics beyond the area of protein folding."
650000,"In the last 150 years, humans have synthesized hundreds of thousands of chemicals featuring functional groups not previously found in nature. Many of these chemicals are eventually biodegraded by recently-evolved enzymes and metabolic pathways found within microbes in soil and water. In some cases, microbes metabolize the chemicals incompletely and release new chemicals into the environment. In other cases, microbes completely metabolize the chemicals and assimilate the carbon, nitrogen and/or phosphorous for growth and survival. Due to the large influx of new chemicals over a very short evolutionary time scale, biodegradation is often suboptimal, marked by enzymes that are unstable and inefficient, and metabolic pathways that are incomplete.<br/><br/>In the past, society waited for natural solutions to evolve. A major goal of this proposal is to further develop the ability to routinely and robustly address the limitations of newly evolved enzymes and metabolic pathways and provide new enzymes useful for commercial purposes. The proposed research will result in a protein-engineering framework to help overcome the deficiencies of newly evolved enzyme pathways by combining the accumulated knowledge about biodegradation pathways with state-of-the-art methods in computational enzyme design and laboratory evolution. This research will bring together two different, but complementary, research groups with additional collaborators in quantum chemistry and X-ray crystallography. Overall, we seek to develop a multi-faceted approach for better understanding natural evolution and creating new functions<br/>not yet discovered in nature.<br/><br/>The proposed work will train undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students at the interface of chemistry, structural biophysics, microbiology, and computer science. Novel pedagogical approaches such as scientific video games and crowdsourcing will be developed and used to engage non-experts in the scientific enterprise. Students from underrepresented groups and minorities will be actively recruited and the PIs will engage in outreach activities involving the public, high school and undergraduate students and their teachers."
1000000,"This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences; the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>The objective of this INSPIRE project is to understand the earliest steps in prebiotic evolution. A longstanding grand-challenge question is how living systems arose from physico-chemical interactions. How did chemistry become biology? When did undirected chemical reactions begin to capitalize on fitness, become self-serving, start competing with others, and undergo Darwinian evolution? If successful, this project will provide a plausible hypothesis for how random chain sequences could have led to information-transmitting chains, as chemistry becomes biology and potentially to new polymeric materials that are not just self-organizing, but are actually self-evolving. An integrated approach of theory and experiment will be used to carry out this challenging and risky project. This is a potentially transformative project because very little is understood about how sequence-specific polymers, such as proteins and peptoid foldamers, could arise through stochastic processes from random monomer sequences. Questions of how life arose from chemistry are among the most compelling and longstanding in science. Much has been hypothesized about origins of life in the RNA world, membrane world, by metabolism-first or code-first mechanisms, for example, but very little of this discussion focuses on the central question of how Darwinian self-serving bio-like behavior arose from non-Darwinian chemistry. This is a long-standing fundamental question and this project is high-risk because it is in the nature of the origins-of-life field that any particular mechanism proposed for the origin of life from chemistry will be met with skepticism. The complexity of identifying functional domains in polymer sequence space is so vast, both theory and experiment must work very closely together to address this problem. The tools to approach this problem experimentally have only just recently been developed. Advances in polymer synthesis have reached an exciting point for the first time: one can now synthesize non-natural polymers with exact control of monomer sequence and length, and assemble these chains into protein-like architectures. This capability allows one to test the most fundamental questions about how information content in polymer chains impacts their structure and function."
705854,"Intellectual Merit:<br/>Cellular environments consist of dense, heterogeneous solutions of biomolecules that differ significantly from the dilute, homogeneous conditions typically considered in structural biology. A consideration of the resulting crowding effects is essential to fully understand biomolecular function in cellular environments. Simulations with realistic models of cellular proteins and nucleic acids are used to examine the physicochemical effects of crowding. The main goal is to better understand the role of intermolecular interactions and altered solvent properties on biomolecular stability upon crowding. The simulations carried out involve models ranging from fully atomistic explicit solvent representations to multi-scale models where solvent and/or crowders are modeled in a simplified fashion. The results from the simulations are essential for developing effective models of cellular environments that are unavailable at the time but urgently needed for large-scale simulations of cellular dynamics.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The broader impact to society will be a more comprehensive understanding of cellular processes from a physical perspective. More specifically, the research aims to connect the detailed molecular-level understanding of biology to processes occurring on cellular and systems levels. Ultimately, such insight will allow the development of detailed in silico cellular models based on physical principles that can be queried to understand complex biological processes. A number of more specific broader impacts will be catalyzed by the research proposed here: Interdisciplinary training of students at the interface of physical, biological, and computational sciences, both graduate students and teams of undergraduate students from physical and biological sciences; promotion of the involvement of women; focused efforts to recruit undergraduates from underrepresented minorities through the IDEAS program at MSU; enhancement of widely used modeling software; promotion of an international collaboration with RIKEN in Japan including short-term research visits abroad for students involved in the project; and broad dissemination of research results through traditional channels as well as public outreach through public presentations to lay audiences."
507823,"Sulfur is an essential element for all life. Bacteria play a key role in the sulfur cycle through diverse metabolic pathways. When sulfur is limited in the environment, bacteria express specific proteins to retain intracellular sulfur. The alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system provides bacteria access to an alternative sulfur source under sulfur limiting conditions. These studies will elucidate the essential role of the alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system in supplying sulfur to bacteria. The broad objective of this project is to fully establish the mechanism used by the alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system to better understand its physiological role in sulfur acquisition and the overall sulfur cycle. <br/><br/>An educational component of this project seeks to encourage students from underrepresented groups in the sciences to participate in research at Auburn University.

518000,"Intellectual Merit<br/>This project will advance the understanding of the role water hydration dynamics in modulating protein flexibility, conformational sampling and biomolecular function. Water hydration is essential in biology and is a critical factor for proper design of engineered materials containing enzymes in biotechnology. The scope of work involves building an Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (ODNP) spectrometer with concomitant design and construction of resonators optimized for biological and materials based samples, such that local diffusion dynamics of hydration water surrounding the materials can be interrogated. Insights into the role of water hydration in macromolecular flexibility will be revealed from combined NMR, EPR and ODNP investigations of targeted systems. These include understanding how molecular crowding modulates folding and dynamics in natively unstructured proteins, how mutations distal from active sites in enzymes may influence hydration and hence conformational sampling and dynamics, and how changes in water hydration are coupled to transmembrane signaling of integral membrane proteins. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The technical scientific training in this research spreads across post-doctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students as well as high school students. The project specifically targets recruiting underrepresented high school students into the University of Florida's Summer Science Teaching Program. Three local high school teachers will participate in screening and nominating two students each summer for this six week research immersion experience. These activities would increase public awareness of the scientific research process to communities where these types of opportunities are rare. Other outreach includes training undergraduate students when they enter college in their first year, over a three to four year time period. These efforts are combined with participation in the Beckman Scholar's and HHMI Science for Life programs."
685063,"Detailed information about protein structure and dynamics at an atomic level is of fundamental importance for understanding protein stability, interactions, and function. The overall goals of this project are the development of new methods for a comprehensive description of complex dynamics of proteins by combining NMR spectroscopy with advanced computer simulations and the application of these methods to biologically important molecular systems. To achieve these objectives, NMR chemical shifts of all amino acid side-chains will be quantitatively parametrized in terms of their structure and environment using databank information and molecular dynamics trajectories into the microsecond range. They will permit the rigorous assessment of the quality of protein ensembles such as ones generated by long molecular dynamics trajectories. These tools together with experimental NMR will be applied for the improvement of the accuracy of low-resolution protein structures and for the characterization of allosteric regulation and high-plasticity ligand binding. The project will produce new algorithms, web servers, and software for the increasingly accurate and realistic characterization of proteins in their native environment. The combination of NMR spectrosccopy with high-performance computation will be applicable to a wide range of biomolecular systems. These tools will be made available to the structural biology, biophysics, and biomolecular NMR communities. <br/><br/>This project will provide interdisciplinary training and research opportunities for undergraduate students in FSU's ""Honors in the Major program"", graduate students, and postdocs at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Florida State University (FSU), at the Institute of Molecular Biophysics at FSU, and at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), with significant numbers of students from demographically underrepresented groups. Research methods and results will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses on biophysics and biomolecular spectroscopy. Selected examples of this research will be presented at the annual Open House at the NHMFL, which attracts a broad cross section of the population of North Florida and its vicinity, helping to increase scientific literacy of the public. An assistant professor at Bethune-Cookman University (BCU), a historically black college in Florida, will be provided space and resources to spend each summer in the PI's lab, which will count toward his professional development activities. He will bring minority undergraduate students with him from BCU to carry out research on NMR parameter calculations and analysis."
581556,"Intellectual merit: <br/>Proteins often undergo post-translational modifications that are critical for their function. The covalent attachment of lipid moieties, such as palmitoyl groups, is one such modification. Proteins can be acylated on N-terminal residues (N-linked), cysteine residues (S-linked) and/or serine residues (O-linked). The S-palmitoylation of cytosolic proteins and the intracellular domains of transmembrane proteins is a reversible process that regulates protein stability, membrane tethering, membrane trafficking, and neuronal transmission. The relatively recent discovery that Wnt morphogens are palmitoylated has raised as many questions as it has answered. For instance, how does palmitoylation regulate morphogen distribution and activity? And how does the structure of the enzymes that catalyze this important modification influence their function? <br/><br/>Porcupine (Porcn), a member of the membrane bound O-acyl transferase (MBOAT) family, is required for the addition of O-linked palmitate to a conserved serine in Wnt proteins. Despite the central role of Porcn in regulating Wnt activity, virtually nothing is known about the structure or enzymatic function of this enzyme. This lack of biochemical insight extends to virtually all palmitoyl acyltransferases, in large part, due to the lack of fast sensitive quantitative assays to measure palmitoylation. <br/><br/>The overall objective of this project is to define the membrane topology of Porcn and to develop and apply a quantitative in vitro approach to assess the roles of residues known to be critical for Porcn function. In addition to gaining specific insight about Porcn structure and function, the project will deliver an assay for acyl transferase activity that would result in significant advancement in this technology for all protein palmitoyl acyltransferases. The project will lay the groundwork for future comparative studies designed to understand the mechanistic differences between S- and O-acyl transferases as well as the similarities and differences between DHHC enzymes that control palmitoylation and MBOATs.<br/><br/>Broader impact:<br/>This work also has important broad impact because the experiments in this project will contribute to a comprehensive and intellectually challenging scientific training experience for undergraduates and master's degree students, many of whom enter the lab with little or no prior research experience. Students (2 undergrads and 2 master's level students per year) will be trained to develop their critical thinking skills, presentation skills, and hands-on technical knowledge, benefiting from a close mentorship relationship with the PI. Involvement in the cutting-edge primary research of this laboratory will contribute significantly to the career development of female and underrepresented minority students at different stages of their careers at San Francisco State University (SFSU), a historically underrepresented minority (URM)-serving institution.

Although there is wide variation in maize resistance to herbivory, very little is known about the underlying genetic basis of these differences among maize cultivars. Genetic mapping, transcript profiling, insect bioassays, and biochemical approaches will be used to identify maize herbivore resistance genes. A particular focus area of this project will be the identification of biosynthetic and regulatory genes contributing to the production and transport of benzoxazinoids, a class of secondary metabolites with important defensive functions in maize, wheat, rye, wild barley, and other grasses. Research involving maize benzoxazinoid metabolism will provide a tractable model system for studying these agriculturally and ecologically important plant metabolites. Genetic mapping using a panel of diverse maize inbred lines will identify novel genes contributing to aphid and caterpillar resistance. Given the wide array of pests and pathogens against which maize plants protect themselves, there are likely to be interactions among the identified defense pathways. Defensive synergies and tradeoffs will be detected by comparing the genomic locations and biochemical functions of the identified maize genes that contribute to natural variation in herbivore resistance. <br/><br/>This project will lead to the identification of previously unknown maize genes that influence plant-herbivore interactions. Potential metabolic limitations and tradeoffs in maize defense against different classes of insect herbivores will be documented. It is anticipated that these expected results will open up new opportunities for using molecular breeding and transgenic approaches to improve herbivore resistance in maize, the most important agricultural crop in the United States. Research conducted through this project will help to train a new generation of students and postdocs for future careers in academia, industry, or government service. International research exchanges with the European ERA-CAPS (http://www.eracaps.org/) companion project entitled ""Biosynthesis, transport and exudation of 1,4-benzoxazin-3-ones as determinants of plant biotic interactions (BENZEX)"" will enhance the training of students and postdocs. Experiments involving maize-herbivore interactions will be fully integrated into an established education and outreach program at the Boyce Thompson Institute. Undergraduate students from throughout the United States will be recruited to be part of a ten-week summer internship program. In one-week training sessions, biology teachers from under-resourced schools will develop new plant science modules for their classes. Experimental kits for conducting caterpillar-feeding assays in local science classrooms will not only provide students with hands-on research experience, but also generate new information about the mechanisms of maize defense against insect herbivory. All data and resources generated through this project will be publicly accessible. A major output of this project will be a publicly available toolkit for studying the role of benzoxazinoids in maize defense against herbivores and pathogens. Seeds of near-isogenic lines and mutants will be deposited in the Maize Genetics Cooperation stock center, DNA clones will be available upon request and assay methods will be published in scientific journals. All DNA sequences will be deposited in public databases such as the NCBI SRA, Gramene, and MaizeGDB. Metabolite and metabolomics data will be deposited at METLIN (http://metlin.scripps.edu/). Education and outreach materials will be published and available for use via the Boyce Thompson Institute website (http://bti.cornell.edu/education/)."
605997,"It is generally accepted that a protein's amino acid sequence is optimized so that the molecule consistently folds into a unique, stable 3D shape while avoiding aggregation with other biomolecules. Yet this view is overly simplistic. On the one hand, many proteins are not monolithic structures; for instance, myoglobin must reliably deform to let in oxygen. On the other hand, under certain conditions, proteins may aggregate into amyloid fibers while in a misfolded conformation. Although very complex, these phenomena can still be understood thermodynamically. Proteins are deformable given a sufficiently large native state entropy, while amyloid fibers are stabilized by multiple amino acid contacts within the fiber. Much less understood are the mesoscopic liquid-like aggregates recently found in several protein solutions, including lysozyme, hemoglobin, and gamma-crystallin. These clusters are important as nucleation sites for protein crystals. The objective of this project is to test a microscopic hypothesis for the formation of the mesoscopic clusters by which the clusters result from the formation of long-lived protein complexes stabilized at high densities. The unusually large cluster size stems from the long lifetime of the complexes, which in turn owe their stability to the conformational freedom of constituent protein molecules. A key component of the proposed mechanism is that proteins partially unfold prior to binding and may even undergo domain swapping, whereby protein segments bind to complimentary segments on a different protein. The PIs will employ a combination of dynamic light scattering, Brownian microscopy, amide exchange NMR, and theoretical modeling to test this mechanism in several systems, including proteins barnase, RNase A, hemoglobin, insulin, and lysozyme.<br/><br/>This research is a multidisciplinary effort by a theoretical physical chemist and experimental chemical engineer. A synthesis of a wide range of physicochemical and biochemical measurements and physical modeling will be undertaken to tackle this difficult problem; the outcome is expected to produce fundamental understanding of biological processes and provide new avenues for making new materials. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be trained at the interface between physics, chemistry, and biology. The home institution of the PIs, the University of Houston, is one of the most ethnically diverse research universities in the nation, and is one of only three Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the US. Existing collaborations with local writers and radio personalities will be utilized to publicize the societal benefits of the research. This project is jointly supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division."
999904,"This CREATIV award is partially funded by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences; the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and the Bioengineering and Engineering Healthcare Cluster in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems in the Directorate of Engineering. <br/><br/>The objective of this CREATIV project is to organize functional components into devices or interfaces that interrogate and control biological systems. Biology performs very complex processes using linear heteropolymers that are made by hooking together a relatively small set of monomers in a particular order. This rather digital approach to creating chemical function can, in principle, be applied to the development of molecular scale devices of our own creation. However, thus far, libraries of molecules that cannot be individually assayed or computationally designed have been used. In addition, the ability to organize functional components into such devices or to create structured molecular interfaces has been quite primitive. Recently, however, a number of interdisciplinary technologies have come together which promise to provide truly new approaches to creating chemical complexity and molecular function that rivals that of biology. Methods have been developed to specifically design, fabricate, and interrogate millions of different molecules in ordered libraries. In addition, functional elements can be incorporated into molecular-scale devices with nanometer accuracy or interfaced directly with micro-electronics, allowing both interrogation and control of complex chemical and biological systems. Here, the first step towards capitalizing on the combined power of these capabilities is proposed. Initially an ordered library of multivalent synthetic ligands on a surface that has a molecular recognition capacity approaching that of the mammalian immune system will be created. This library will then be used to enhance three research efforts; organizing and optimizing multienzyme reaction pathways using DNA nanostructures; interfacing redox proteins with electrodes using the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center as a model; and finally identifying eukaryotic cell types and controlling their gene expression patterns and growth/differentiation characteristics via specific molecular interactions.<br/><br/>The integration of technologies and concepts in computational design, high throughput molecular synthesis, high throughput detailed chemical analysis, and electronic integration has the potential to create completely artificial systems with the complexity and diverse functionality of biological systems, but with the accessible control mechanisms that interface seamlessly with the electronic world. The project depends on collaboration among computational, synthetic, electronic and biological regulation capabilities. This project will expose junior scientists to the challenges of interdisciplinary research, and will allow them to be involved at the creation of conceptual frameworks and initial tools that could lead to highly efficient multi-enzyme pathways, rapid systems for personalized drug development, comprehensive diagnostics, energy harvesting, and a new type of biohybrid circuitry that interconverts chemical and electronic information."
774236,"Intellectual merit<br/>The physical properties of globular proteins are a topic of intense investigation and practical importance. Multiple approaches have been deployed to understand the determinants of stability and plasticity of these vital biomolecules. Among the methods that are most useful, but so far much underutilized, is nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) at high pressure. The combination of gentle perturbation and residue-level description afforded by this technique has excellent potential for exposing novel architectural principles in proteins. The proposed research will combine molecular biology, amino acid sequence analysis, and high-pressure NMR methods to explore the native state of a set of monomeric bacterial and algal hemoglobins. The work will investigate the original notion that a common internal cavity network is a crucial entity governing conformational changes concerted with ligand binding and volume dynamics. Studies will be extended to related proteins from organisms that live in high pressure environments to enhance the description of the molecular attributes of globins functioning under extreme conditions of pressure and low temperature. Because the globins of interest are enzymatic and of ancient origin, the results will pertain to multiple fields of inquiry besides protein physical chemistry, including phylogenetics, heme chemistry, and molecular evolution. These ramifications offer an opportunity for laboratory and classroom training of students with diverse interests.<br/><br/>Broader impact<br/>The broader impact of the proposed research will be achieved through a combination of teaching, training, outreach, and dissemination. Research results will be incorporated in a biophysics undergraduate course in spectroscopy and in a graduate course in biophysical methods. Training will be provided to graduate and undergraduate students, including REU summer students, working directly on the project. Participation in outreach activities will include lab tours for high-school students along with research and career presentations to attract women and underrepresented groups to STEM fields. Participation in the Biophysics Research for Baltimore Teens summer program (organized by the Program in Molecular Biophysics of Johns Hopkins University) will focus on introducing selected high-school students of Baltimore City to scientific research. Dissemination will be through publications, lectures at other institutions, participation in conferences, and database depositions."
714922,"Intellectual Merit: <br/>The goal of the project is to design proteases from alpha-lytic protease (aLP) that have new and different substrate specificities. The project will develop new methods and tools to determine the primary structure of proteins, in particular to determine which amino acids are post-translationally modified. Nearly all large-scale protein sequencing experiments are currently performed using mass spectrometry to analyze pieces of proteins that were digested with the protease, trypsin, which cleaves after lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues. Trypsin cleavage produces enough peptides to provide sufficient unique protein sequence for protein identification, but more complete coverage of protein sequences is required for post-translational modification (PTM) localization. Preliminary results show that aLP is ideal for proteomics because a few active site mutations alter its substrate specificity towards either small aliphatic residues or large hydrophobic residues. These ""orthogonal"" types of amino acids (compared to K and R, which are charged) allow access to more and different parts of the protein sequence. Building on the aLP platform, a family of engineered proteases will be designed with varying substrate cleavage specificities to enable coverage of entire protein sequences. An application that will be investigated is the determination of which sites in proteins are modified with the small ubiquitin-like modification (SUMO). The generated mutants provide ideal substrate specificity for detection of SUMOylation in the S. pombe yeast proteome. Cleavage of SUMOylated proteins using a mutant aLP generates GG-tagged lysines that can be detected with existing approaches. Thus aLP will provide the first comprehensive survey of which proteins are SUMOylated in yeast.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The broader impacts of the project include development of novel proteases that will be widely useful to the proteomics community. A survey of researchers engaged in proteomics studies reveals the dire need for such robustly active ""orthogonal"" proteases. The project will result in large proteomic data sets that will aid in the prediction of modification sites and provide information for basic research into cell biology and protein structure/function. Data analysis programs will also be developed that will be widely disseminated via the web. Two undergraduate researchers will be involved in the project throughout the project period. The PI has a long history of mentoring undergraduates, who have entered careers in science, with a particular focus on encouraging diversity. The PI founded at UCSD the Research Scholars program that provides research training for high school students from diverse backgrounds. The participants are mentored by assigned pairs of faculty and graduate students. Mentoring is continued up to the point where participants choose colleges and majors. In the first two years, more than 90% of the students completed the program having decided on a career in scientific research. One and possibly 2 students from the Research Scholars Program will work on aspects of this NSF project."
710564,"An award is made to Texas A&M University to develop a new and unique instrument which will be sought by users within and outside Texas A&M University and provide unsurpassed capabilities for the cutting-edge research and education in the areas of molecular and cellular biology, agriculture, engineering, medicine, and national defense. The new instrumentation is unique in many aspects, and it is anticipated that it will play a major role in developing new approaches for high-throughput cellular analysis, which are in high demand in biology and medicine. One of the thrust areas of emerging applications for this instrument is lipidomics. Microbes (both natural and engineered) that can convert biomass into oil offer the promise of achieving sustainable oil production and enhancing domestic energy independence. The newly developed instrument will substantially enhance the University infrastructure by uniting several Colleges, Institutes and Centers. This project will support broader impacts that promote the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the general public. Specifically, this project will provide research opportunities and training for highly motivated undergraduates across several colleges and research disciplines; provide unique educational opportunities for students from the Texas Rio Grande Valley and the United States-Mexico border region, which includes the most economically disadvantaged areas of the country according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The results will be broadly disseminated through publications, public presentations, tutorial, and hands-on training seminars. Finally, findings from this research will be disseminated to the public through broadcasted segments on ""Invisible Jungle"", an undergraduate-produced radio program that is carried weekly on the local National Public Radio Affiliate, KAMU radio (College Station, Texas).<br/><br/><br/>Identification, classification and sorting live cells are activities of considerable research and commercial interest. Chemical composition and elasticity in cells play an important role our classification and our understanding of function. Conventional analysis of the chemical composition of cells involves the use of molecular labels or analytical approaches that destroy cell viability. Similarly, the conventional analysis of biomechanical or elastic properties of biological materials involves labor intensive and slow approaches. No commercial instrument exists to assess those properties at a high throughput rate (>1000 cells per second) and non-invasively. The potential demand for such instrumentation is enormous, since almost every research/industrial/clinical lab relies on cell sorting. By providing additional capabilities, the newly developed instrument will also fill existing gaps in instrumentation. Innovations in scientific instrumentation often share several key features. First, these innovations perform measurements that were previously impossible. Second, they perform analyses at low cost with unprecedented throughput. Finally, instrumentation innovations address an important scientific need. Here, we will develop a transformative technology platform that contains all of the hallmarks of innovation in scientific instrumentation, and as such, has the potential to significantly advance life science, biomedical and engineering research. The overall instrument will be composed of two parts: (1) an optical sensing unit optimized for (a) chemical analysis of cells by means of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy, and (b) biophysical measurements of elasticity in cells through coherent Brillouin scattering; and (2) multifunctional microfluidic devices providing standardized platforms for cell delivery, sorting, and in situ validation of cell?s elastic properties. The newly developed instruments will also be validated using biological samples."
848526,"Intellectual Merit: The border between the interior and exterior of a living cell is a membrane that is only a few nanometers thick. Proteins embedded in cell membranes are the molecular machines that control the flow of matter, energy and information across the border of the cell, and understanding their structures helps to understand how they function. Unfortunately, structural techniques like crystallography and NMR don't work as well for membrane proteins, so new methods are needed. This research project will develop new molecular probes and experimental methods that will provide information on protein structure. The new probes take advantage of the remarkable magnetic properties of ions of the element gadolinium (Gd3+), which are already used to enhance contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). When excited by a laser inside a very high magnetic field, gadolinium ions precess (wobble) like tops at a frequency of 240 billion cycles per second (240 gigahertz); this occurs about 20,000 times before relaxing most of the way to thermal equilibrium. When a Gd3+ ion is close to another, it relaxes more quickly. Moreover, when the two are less than 10 nanometers apart, the precession amplitude oscillates between the two ions at a ""beat frequency"" that varies sensitively with the distance between the ions. Together, the relaxation times, precession frequencies, and beat frequency give distance (and ultimately structural) information. These parameters will be measured using newly developed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometers at UC Santa Barbara (240 gigahertz) and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel (95 gigahertz). To calibrate the new methodologies, measurements of the distance between gadolinium ions will be performed on ""ruler"" compounds consisting of Gd3+ ions separated by a stiff, linear polymer to known distances between 2 and 12 nm. Distance measurements will then be performed between carefully-chosen sites on proteorhodopsin. Proteorhodopsin is a light-activated proton pump isolated from a marine bacterium and is similar in structure to membrane proteins that occur in all other organisms. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The project is a new interdisciplinary international collaboration between the U. S. (Song-I Han and Mark Sherwin, UC Santa Barbara), Israel (Daniella Goldfarb, Weizmann Institute of Science), and Germany (Adelheidt Godt, University of Bielefeld, probe synthesis). The collaborators and co-PI are female physicists with considerable expertise in developing new technology. This proposal will support two graduate students and one undergraduate. These students are cross-trained by shuttling between the Han lab (physical chemistry and biochemistry) and the Sherwin lab (experimental physics), and are thus immersed in the science of ""soft matter,"" magnetic resonance, proteins, microwave electronics, terahertz science and technology, and visible optics. Students also will perform experiments in the remarkable magnetic resonance community at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, greatly enriching their training with an international scientific experience. The Gd3+ spin labels and high-field electron paramagnetic resonance techniques that the students develop will enable new studies of membrane proteins in life-like environments by many other scientists. These labels are stable enough to be used inside the complex environment of living cells, where measurements of protein structure and dynamics are most interesting but also most challenging."
615527,"Intellectual Merit:<br/>Allosteric regulation is a central tenet of modern biochemistry, however, it is a mechanism that is still not well understood. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how allosteric and catalytic mechanisms work together in multi-domain enzymes. This research examines the mechanistic and evolutionary interactions between two conserved domains in the context of the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily. An integrated experimental approach, including biochemical, structural, and bioinformatics techniques is used to (a) determine the identity of kinetic steps perturbed in allosteric inhibition, (b) predict and verify functional and structural diversity and (c) investigate the role of conserved residues in the allosteric mechanism. This type of approach overcomes several difficulties commonly encountered in the study of allosteric enzymes, moves away from the phenomenological description of different allosteric mechanisms and considers the impact of evolutionary pressures on the diversity of mechanisms within a conserved protein scaffold. Rapid-reaction kinetics and kinetic isotope effects will be used to investigate the changes to enzyme mechanisms caused by allosteric inhibitors. The creation of a protein similarity network for the model allosteric domain will provide rapid organization for a large number of diverse sequences predicted to contain the domain. High-throughput structural techniques will provide essential structural coverage for clusters of sequences currently lacking structural description. Mechanistic and structural data will be mapped onto the protein similarity network to define the functional and structural boundaries of the model allosteric domain. The integrated results will provide a description of structure/function relationships contributing to functional and allosteric diversity and also give insight into how a single protein scaffold evolves multiple allosteric mechanisms. The outcomes of this research will impact the growing areas of allosteric biosensors and metabolic engineering of bacterial strains for industrial uses. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This project will promote interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students at The University of Alabama. Graduate student training will be enhanced by an on-site visit to the laboratory of Dr. Patricia Babbitt at the University of California, San Francisco for hands-on training in cutting edge bioinformatics techniques. Undergraduate training will be accomplished through two mechanisms designed to increase exposure to original hypothesis-based research. The first mechanism will provide multiple positions in the Frantom laboratory for undergraduate researchers from the University of Alabama Emerging Scholars to continue performing mentored research. The second mechanism is the creation of a formal undergraduate laboratory course to mimic key experiences encountered in undergraduate research. Students unable to participate in direct scientific research will benefit from a laboratory course built around performing original hypothesis-driven experiments that contribute directly to the intellectual merit of this project."
645029,"Title: Investigation of RNA-processing protein dynamics with simultaneous high-resolution optical traps and single-molecule fluorescence<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will develop optical methods that will enable direct observation in real-time of the activity of protein machines that are involved in processing RNA. RNA is one of the essential carriers of cell information, and its production and degradation are tightly controlled by RNA protein interactions associated with protein machines. The overall goal of this project is to investigate how both the cooperation and competition between different molecular machines lead to the careful regulation of information in the cell. The techniques developed in this project will apply beyond the protein machines involved in RNA processing to include a broad assortment of complex protein systems. This project will leverage optical methods development and the strong art and science connection at Michigan State University to develop an education and outreach program centered on hands-on interactions with biophysical science at the individual cell and RNA molecule level. The PI will create a video game lab experience aimed at students and the public.<br/><br/>This project will investigate RNA-processing protein dynamics of single proteins and larger protein machine assemblies by developing and applying high-resolution, multi-modal single molecule techniques. Specifically, the PI will investigate the yeast nuclear RNA helicase Mtr4p and the associated TRAMP protein complex. Mtr4p and TRAMP have emerged as key players in nuclear RNA surveillance and processing in part via precise modification of RNA for degradation by the exosome. How these machines coordinate or compete to achieve function is controversial in large part due to their highly dynamic, multi-degree of freedom interactions on the scale of only 5-10 nucleotides of RNA. The PI will address the fundamental questions regarding how Mtr4p and TRAMP function using single-molecule and high resolution optical tweezers and fluorescence. Advanced techniques combining high-resolution optical trapping and multi-color fluorescence will apply broadly across all biophysical molecular dynamics investigations towards the emerging need for tools to investigate protein-nucleic acid interactions beyond the individual molecule scale towards multi-protein, multi-degree of freedom complex systems."
502398,"Award Abstract #1256086: Enhanced Knife-Edge Scanning Microscopy<br/> for Sub-micrometer Imaging of Whole Small Animal Organs<br/><br/>This NSF award, made to the Brain Networks Laboratory at Texas A&M University, will help enhance and transform the Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM), a ""one of a kind"" microscopy instrument, into a more widely available system for biological research. KESM is capable of sectioning and imaging whole small animal organs at submicrometer resolution (that is, in very fine detail, smaller than the size of a single cell). A prototype KESM instrument was constructed, and its capability was successfully demonstrated by scanning diverse biological organs including whole mouse brains, octopus brains, and the mouse lung at submicrometer resolution. This project will enhance this prototype significantly, and transform it into a robust system that can be replicated and operated with ease by other research groups and industry partners. The enhanced instrument to be built by this project addresses at least two major emerging directions in biological research: (1) ""omics"" (the study of a total collection of some biological entity, for example, genomics for genes) and (2) multi-scale modeling (modeling systems across a range of scales, for example from the cell up to the whole organ). With the tremendous success of genomics in the 1990's and beyond, biological research is increasingly moving toward various forms of omics. Much of the omics research depends on anatomical information (e.g., connectomics, studying the complete wiring diagram in the brain) or genomic information (e.g., gene expression levels) at the whole-organ-level. Multi-scale modeling has also become a major methodological process in biological research. In many projects in omics and multi-scale modeling, sub-micrometer microscopy data from whole biological organs are essential yet available tools are unable to meet the current demand. KESM is expected to fill this gap. The specific enhancements of the instrument include: (1) enhanced imaging (higher resolution optics and camera, fluorescence imaging [key to genetic and molecular studies]), (2) enhanced mechanical control (more rigid, accurate, and higher resolution motion control), (3) enhanced cutting (vibrating knife, real time monitoring), and (4) enhanced robustness (quality monitoring, calibration). The overall resulting improvement can be summarized as follows: (1) 3X improvement in imaging resolution, (2) 10X improvement in robustness of operation, (3) 10X improvement in imaging speed (compared to competing methods), (4) new fluorescence imaging capability. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: (1) Impact on the research community: The enhanced KESM will allow researchers to obtain high resolution, whole-organ data for multi-scale, omics investigation of various types of biological organs. (2) Impact on education: Microscopic atlases of whole biological organs, such as the web-based KESM mouse brain atlas developed by the project team, will serve as an educational resource for students and educators at all levels (K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and general public). As part of this project, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in a multidisciplinary environment (neuroscience and computer science). (3) Instrument dissemination plan: The project team will collaborate with a start-up company, to streamline system integration and manufacturing of the KESM instrument for broader dissemination. The design of the instrument and the operational instructions will be made available to the biological research community for those who wish to build their own instrument."
501186,"Intellectual Merit<br/>The assembly of an infectious virus within the cell is a remarkably conserved process in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses. For instance, the assembly of most large DNA viruses includes a ""packaging"" step, where the viral genome is physically inserted into the confines of a pre-assembled capsid shell. Genome packaging is catalyzed by a terminase enzyme, which utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to fuel the reaction. This ultimately yields a capsid that contains tightly packaged DNA, which can generate over 20 atmospheres of internal pressure. The packaging process triggers a major reorganization of the proteins assembled into the capsid shell, which often results in expansion of the structure. This is a remarkable process whereby the spherical procapsid shell thins, acquires a mature angular shape, and roughly doubles the internal volume to accept the entire genome length. Exactly when procapsid expansion occurs, what drives it, and what role it plays is not fully understood in any system. In most cases, a ""decoration"" protein adds to the surface of the expanded shell to stabilize the structure against the tremendous internal forces generated by the packaged DNA. The physical and chemical features that mediate decoration protein binding to the expanded shell and how these interactions stabilize the structure remain poorly characterized. Once the entire genome has been packaged, the terminase motor is ejected from the nucleocapsid and is replaced by ""finishing proteins"" to yield the virus particle. How this ""hand-off"" takes place without release of the tightly packaged, highly pressurized DNA is poorly understood in all virus systems. Bacteriophage lambda has been intensely studied using genetic, biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches and defined biochemical assays are available to interrogate each step along the assembly pathway. This project capitalizes on these defined systems to interrogate three critical steps in viral genome packaging that are common and essential for the assembly of all large double-stranded DNA viruses. Specifically, this project will define and characterize the physical and chemical forces that (i) drive procapsid expansion, (ii) mediate decoration protein assembly of the expanded capsid shell, and (iii) facilitate handoff of the nucleocapsid from the motor to the finishing proteins without release of the tightly packaged, highly pressurized DNA. The project incorporates collaborative studies to provide a complementary structural framework with which to understand the biochemical data. Procapsid expansion, stabilization of the DNA-filled capsid by decoration proteins, and hand-off of the pressurized nucleocapsid to finishing proteins is observed from phages to the herpesviruses. This research will reveal fundamental new information on virus assembly mechanisms. Understanding the physical and chemical mechanisms by which a capsid can expand without fracturing will serve as a paradigm for a large class of macromolecular transformations observed throughout biology. This research will provide a detailed understanding of essential steps in virus assembly and will be applicable to a variety of biological processes.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>This work will further afford technical advances that will allow adaptation of the lambda system as a nanotechnology platform for a variety of bioengineering applications. Importantly, the project will provide training opportunities for students spanning from undergraduate summer research programs, to graduate Ph.D. thesis studies and to post-graduate research experiences. This research project will result in the training and mentoring of promising young scientists. The recruitment and training of minority scientists is an important component of this research program. Undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students will perform the studies described in this application which will provide training for a new generation of scientists."
685000,"The objective of this CAREER project, jointly funded by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, is to develop a physics-based coarse-grained force field that can be widely applicable for modeling proteins and regulation of protein-protein interactions. Although simulation methods that evolve the classical dynamics of atomically detailed models have contributed considerable insight into the structure and equilibrium fluctuations of single proteins, the computational expense of all-atom models limits their application for more complex systems. These limitations have motivated tremendous interest in coarse-grained (CG) models that provide much greater computational efficiency, while still providing a detailed description of protein structure. Many CG models can be broadly categorized as either knowledge-based or physics-based models. Knowledge-based models are empirically developed using statistics compiled from experimentally-determined structures present in the protein databank (PDB). In contrast, physics-based protein models are developed using more rigorous theories and, consequently, hold the potential for greater accuracy. This project bridges the gap between knowledge- and physics-based models by employing a rigorous statistical mechanics framework to develop protein models from PDB structures. This project will first quantify and systematically improve the approximations employed in current knowledge-based methods. These results will guide the development of a highly efficient CG model that accurately describes the structure and interactions for a wide range of proteins. <br/><br/>The PI will develop a pioneering intergenerational science club (ISC) to capitalize upon the vastly underused expertise of emeritus faculty to strengthen local intergenerational community, enrich K-12 education in underserved rural Pennsylvania, and promote an active lifestyle of life-long learning. The ISC will be initially developed as series of lectures for local retirees given by emeritus Penn State faculty, but will develop laboratory components and also additional outreach to K-12 students. This program will provide unique intergenerational mentorship for students of all ages and employ discovery-based education to inform the general electorate about the impact of cutting-edge scientific research upon modern society. The Penn State Outreach Office and the Pennsylvania Cooperative Extension will publish and distribute the program further propagating its impact. This project will also develop interdisciplinary physical chemistry curriculum and supplemental lectures to empower chemistry students with the rigorous mathematical and physical tools necessary for addressing the fundamental scientific challenges of the future."
514730,"Proteins are large biological molecules that are an essential part of all living organisms, in charge of all biochemical processes and of all cellular housekeeping tasks. Proteins are the most complex molecules known. This project will use pressure to examine the molecular determinants of stability and other fundamental properties of proteins. One goal is to understand why the structure of proteins, and in particular, the presence of empty cavities inside the protein, renders them sensitive to pressure. These cavities are involved in many important biochemical processes, such as enzymatic catalysis (enzymes are proteins that facilitate chemical reactions), thus it is important to understand properties such as their volume, whether they are empty or whether water is found inside them, how they change over the course of functional processes, and how they affect the essential communication between different parts of the protein. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be trained in computational and experimental biophysics. Dr. García-Moreno is actively engaged in the development of a modern science curriculum focused on the training of biology students in more physical, computational and quantitative approaches. He also has been very active and will continue to be engaged in his role as mentor and advisor to students from many groups that are underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>Proteins can be unfolded with pressure. This implies that the net volume of the unfolded state is smaller than the volume of the folded state. The origins of these volume differences are not obvious. This project is focused on fundamental and systematic studies of cavities and pressure unfolding of proteins, with emphasis on the roles of cavities as determinants of pressure unfolding and on the properties of the cavities. One goal is to examine the relationship between the size, character, state of hydration and location of cavities, and a protein's sensitivity to pressure, its thermodynamic stability, and the magnitude of volume change measured upon unfolding. A second goal is to study the effects of cavities on fluctuations and correlated motions, on dynamics in the hydrophobic interior, on structural cooperativity, and on internal hydration. The experiments that will be performed for this project will further fundamental understanding of structural and thermodynamic consequences of cavities in proteins, especially under conditions of high hydrostatic pressure. The approach that will be pursued involves equilibrium thermodynamic experiments to measure volume changes with pressure unfolding monitored by Trp fluorescence and high pressure NMR, measurement of thermodynamic stability with chemical denaturation, x-ray crystallography to determine crystal structures of proteins to describe the location and volume of internal cavities, and MD simulations to examine the state of hydration of cavities and structural consequences of the application of pressure. High pressure NMR spectroscopy will also be used to examine the response of proteins to pressure with atomic resolution, by characterizing the pressure dependence of fast backbone and side chain dynamics. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

The goals of this CAREER project are 1) to develop VERT as a method to study the evolutionary dynamics of microbes during laboratory evolution using the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), 2) to utilize VERT for engineering complex properties of microbial systems, by applying it to the engineering of E. coli for enhanced tolerance to a biofuel (1-butanol), and 3) to determine the genetic processes underlying the evolution of E. coli by determining the changes in genomic structure and gene expression that occur in response to 1-butanol.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: VERT will be developed into an educational tool by 1) developing web-based modules, including a documentary, for the broad public dissemination of information about the development and application of this technology, 2) involving high school and undergraduate students (particularly women and minorities under-represented in science and engineering) in the research, thereby training future scientists and engineers, and 3) using VERT to illustrate and teach the process of evolution to high school and undergraduate students."
525500,"The objective of this CAREER project is to study folding and structure of a model retroviral 5'-untranslated leader RNA using single molecule methods. Two aspects of the RNA folding problem are exemplified by retroviral genomic RNAs. First, despite many possible conformations, a long viral RNA strand can adopt a well-defined structure under a given set of conditions. Second, large RNAs, such as the untranslated leader region of retroviruses, can rearrange into alternative folds in a timely fashion when triggered by different signals, such as those associated with host cell growth. To understand this intriguing structural stability and flexibility, the folding and structure transition of RNA will be studied one molecule at a time. Each RNA molecule will be stretched and relaxed like a rubber band using optical tweezers, with structure transitions revealed by extension of the molecule. The strategy of this project is to analyze alternative folding of individual domains, followed by examination of the entire leader RNA. Specifically, the TAR domain will be studied as an example of alternative secondary folding, whereas the DIS domain will be examined to understand structural rearrangements in RNA-RNA interactions. Characteristic folding patterns of these domains will be later used as fingerprints to interpret folding trajectories of the entire leader RNA. Furthermore, collaborations are established with theoreticians to interpret experimental data and to test physical models of RNA folding. Molecular dynamics simulations will be employed to examine RNA structure under tension at atomic levels. Statistical mechanical modeling is used to bridge the gap between single molecule and bulk observations. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this project includes developing a new method to study alternative folding and structural rearrangement of large RNAs. In the post-genomic world, new models for RNA folding that extend beyond the most stable structure will be useful to predict versatile biological functions of untranslated RNAs from the ever-growing sequence database. This project with single-molecule study will provide direct observations necessary to calibrate the leading folding theories, and will foster close collaborations between biologists and physicists, experimentalists and theoreticians. The project will be conducted at the newly founded RNA Institute at SUNY Albany, providing long-term research opportunities in the RNA field for undergraduate and graduate students of diverse backgrounds. The project incorporates RNA structural biology and biophysics into teaching by participating in several graduate courses that are open to all students from the New York capital region institutions, including SUNY, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York State Department of Health, and Northeast Regional Forensics Institute. Techniques used in this research, such as stretching DNA, will be developed as lab demonstrations for undergraduate and graduate courses in various disciplines as well as ex-curricular scientific activities for high school students."
525000,"The objective of this project is to obtain new insights into elasticity and dynamic properties of the protein elastin, using solid-state NMR. Elastin is comprised primarily of long hydrophobic chains interspersed with alanine-rich cross linking regions. Elastin has a complex makeup and there is limited information to link its molecular-scale structure and dynamics to its elasticity. The very nature of this protein precludes the use of high-resolution structural tools, such as X-ray crystallography and solution-state NMR. In this project the PI will utilize solid-state NMR and related methods to provide an integrated and detailed picture of the dynamics and structure of native elastin. This project also includes the first characterization of elastin fibers in native like conditions, using innovations in sample preparation and probe design. This is the only solid state NMR-focused research program with a dedicated, long-standing interest in the molecular-scale characterization of elastin. <br/><br/>This project will provide an excellent training opportunity to students at all levels. The PI will train postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary research project at the interface of chemistry, physics and biology. In addition, the PI will provide research experience to future high school teachers."
573919,"In the developing embryo, growing nerves have to navigate long distances to find their targets and to connect up the nervous system. The individual fibers of the nerves are known as axons, and understanding how axons navigate is of great interest as it explains how the initial complexity of the brain and nervous system arises. Growing axons respond to cues in their environment that can either be attractive or repulsive; the same cues can also stimulate overall growth. The Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) gene is present in most organisms with a nervous system. Dscam unexpectedly allows axons to detect well-known navigational cues and to respond to them. The working model that drives much of the work in this proposal is that Dscam interprets the cues as attractive signals and stimulates axon growth towards the cues. This model is being tested in the fruit fly Drosophila using a genetic approach. The fruit fly nervous system is simple enough to observe the growth of single axons and to analyze how axons are affected when Dscam activity is reduced or absent. The results from the experiments will allow evaluation of whether all or part of the model is correct. The work is supported by experiments on tissue culture cells examining how Dscam and the cues physically interact. The project provides state of the art genetic and molecular biology training for both graduate and undergraduate students. The results derived from this study are expected to advance our knowledge of how axons grow and navigate in the fruit fly, as well as in many other nervous systems including the vertebrate spinal cord."
686845,"Nojirimycins (NJs) are nitrogen analogs of common sugars, in which the nitrogen atom is found in the ring, in place of the endocyclic ring oxygen. The NJs are found in some soil dwelling bacteria (Bacilli and Streptomyces) and in some plants. The initial and notable observation about NJ and various homologs are that these compounds often exhibit selective and potent inhibition of glycosyl hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. Despite over 40 years of recognition, the biosynthesis of these important natural products remains undefined to date, apart from knowledge that glucose is the biosynthetic precursor. Further, the reason or reasons for the NJ's occurrence in Nature remains unknown, but their function as inhibitors of glycoside hydrolase/transferase enzymes suggests that these compounds may serve as part of a complex chemical ecology of soil bacteria, plant host and other interacting species via perturbation of glycosylation states. The studies set forth in this project seek to identify the complete set of genes coding for the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of nojirimycin and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) in the bacteria B. amyloliquefaciens and B. atrophaeus. The genes will be cloned and expressed in E. coli for production of recombinant biosynthetic enzymes. The enzymes will be characterized in terms of their substrate specificity and other steady state kinetic parameters. Finally, knockout strains of B.amyloliquefaciens will be produced and compared to wild type strains in microcosm experiments with pea seedlings and plant pathogens and perturbations in the populations as a function of the presence of DNJ will be identified. A correlation between DNJ production and changes in the microbial ecology of the rhizosphere would provide new evidence for the natural function of the nojirimycins.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The research project will involve undergraduate and graduate students, and provide them with a multidisciplinary research training experience. An important part of the project will include outreach to secondary schools. Floridian secondary school science teachers will be recruited to participate in summer research. The teachers will be provided the opportunity to develop learning/teaching modules based on their research experience that can be brought back to the classroom. The science developed in this research project may have broad impact in terms of providing new catalysts for ""green"" synthetic reactions, and provide new insight into manipulating interactions among members of microbial communities."
962000,"This research project aims to understand the role of structural plasticity in mediating binding specificity and affinity between protein domains and flexible ligands. The specific recognition of a ligand is the key function of many proteins, and forms the basis of the extensive networks that coordinate the activities of central biological processes. In many biological contexts, a protein domain functionally recognizes a family of related ligands while discriminating against structurally similar ligands. The hypothesis to be tested is that the recognition of related ligands is more structurally diverse than can be inferred from a single structure of a protein-ligand complex. The rigorous biochemical and structural analysis of the ensemble of conformations adopted at biomolecular interfaces that is part of this research program will contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ligand-binding specificity. Furthermore, this knowledge will provide insights for computational efforts aimed at understanding and predicting ligand-binding specificity. <br/><br/>This work will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms that confer specificity in protein-ligand interactions, which are essential to a wide variety of biological functions. In addition, the structural and biochemical data will complement ongoing computational studies by others that seek to model protein-ligand interactions. Furthermore, the program outlined here promotes teaching, training and learning while advancing scientific discovery. These activities occur through a well-designed and thoughtful postdoctoral fellow and graduate student mentoring program, as well as through teaching innovations in the undergraduate classroom. The PI also participates in several programs to increase the participation of under-represented groups, including women and minorities in science, ranging from faculty, postdoctoral fellow and graduate student career mentoring to tailoring the graduate curriculum to facilitate recruitment and retention of under-represented minorities. This program supports the use of our regional high field NMR facilities, including 800 and 900 MHz instruments equipped with cryogenic probes. In addition to the normal avenues of dissemination of research findings, including peer-reviewed publication and presentations at scientific meetings, the PI participates in community outreach through science activities at local schools and as a CU Wizard, orchestrating a community science show."
870933,"Intellectual Merit. <br/>Isonitriles are organic molecules that contain a carbon-nitrogen triple bond. These molecules, which are involved in radical chemistry and are important reagents for multi-component chemical reactions, are both difficult to synthesize chemically and possess an extremely foul odor. These properties have likely limited the study and use of these interesting compounds. Surprisingly, there are many examples of biological isonitrile compounds, found in both terrestrial and marine environments. These compounds are commonly produced by bacterial pathogens, including species that infect fish, plants, insects, and mammals. The mechanistic basis for biosynthesis of isonitrile natural products has not been studied. This project will investigate the enzymology of PvcA, the isonitrile-synthesizing enzyme from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathway that is responsible for the synthesis of a novel natural product. This enzyme converts the amino group of tyrosine to an isonitrile, using the C2 carbon of ribulose-5-phosphate as the source of the carbon atom in the isonitrile. This research project will examine the structural and functional mechanisms of the PvcA enzymes from three homologous bacterial pathways. A catalytic mechanism for the PvcA reaction will be tested through the collaborative enzymatic and structural approaches using the crystal structure of the PvcA enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa as an experimental framework. These isonitrile clusters additionally contain PvcB, a non-heme oxygenase that catalyzes pathway-specific two- or four-electron oxidations. The structural and chemical basis for differences in reactions catalyzed by PvcB will also be examined. These experiments will provide detailed mechanistic insights into the structure and function of these novel enzymes, expanding our knowledge of the synthetic capabilities of diverse microorganisms.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>This research project will explore the enzymatic synthesis of isonitriles, an area of research that is virtually unexplored and will therefore provide an exciting research opportunity to graduate and undergraduate trainees. Specifically, this project will support the training of two graduate students. It will additionally support multiple undergraduate students through established, highly successful summer and academic year research programs. Undergraduate students will fully participate in lab activities, will present their work and write lab reports, and will be integrated into the lab so that they understand the contribution made to the larger research study. Students will be trained to identify and address specific hypothesis-driven questions and will receive broad interdisciplinary training in the important areas of chemical, biochemical, and structural biology.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division."
626455,"Intellectual Merit: <br/>Two-component signal transduction pathways and expanded multi-step His-Asp phosphorelay signaling pathways control how bacteria and fungal organisms respond and adapt to environmental stress. The His-Asp phosphorelay pathways found in eukaryotes frequently feature multiple upstream sensor kinases (HKs) and downstream response regulator (RR) proteins, yet nearly all depend on a single intermediate histidine phosphotransfer (HPt) protein for phosphoryl group transfer. Although several thousands of HK-RR cognate pairs have been identified in bacteria and fungi, very little is understood about protein-protein interactions that govern specificity within a particular pathway and prevent cross-talk within a single organism. <br/><br/>The relative simplicity of the signal transduction pathway (one HK, one HPt and two RRs) in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, together with recent X-ray crystallographic studies of the Ypd1 HPt protein in complex with the Sln1 receiver domain, provides an excellent foundation for the investigation of molecular interactions within a phosphorelay signaling system. The long-term goal of this research is to understand regulation of phosphate flow from Ypd1 to the downstream response regulators, Ssk1 and Skn7, as a function of environmental stress. The main objective of this project is to achieve a detailed understanding of the structural, biochemical and functional implications of Ypd1 interactions with the three homologous response regulator domains associated with Sln1, Ssk1 and Skn7.<br/><br/>The specific aims are designed to test the hypothesis that molecular interactions within the yeast phosphorelay signaling pathway are influenced by external environmental signals and the phosphorylation state of the interacting signaling partners. A multidisciplinary approach using structural, biochemical and genetic approaches will be taken. Specific Aim 1 is structural characterization of Ypd1 (HPt) protein complexes with cognate RR domains. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the effect of site-specific mutations in Ypd1 and/or RR domains on protein binding affinity, phosphotransfer and specificity of interaction. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the in vivo consequences of mutations that affect Ypd1-RR interactions in the SLN1 pathway.<br/>The proposed research has broad significance with respect to how signaling partners interact with each other and influence fidelity of signal transduction. The results are expected to reveal, for the first time, key structural features that contribute to HPt-RR interactions and signaling specificity within multistep phosphorelay systems from all three domains of life.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Results from this project are expected to provide significant new insight into the principles that govern signal transduction pathways, specifically, the role of protein phosphorylation and its impact on regulating protein-protein interactions. The integration of research and student training is an important aspect of this proposal. A summer exchange program for undergraduate students at the University of Oklahoma and the University of Iowa will provide cross-disciplinary training in structural, biochemical and in vivo genetic approaches. In addition, a hands-on laboratory-based X-ray crystallography course will be developed and offered at the graduate-level or senior undergraduate capstone level at University of Oklahoma. Students will have the opportunity to access state-of-the-art (NSF-funded) crystallization robotics instrumentation and apply X-ray diffraction techniques to solve the three-dimensional structure of biomacromolecules."
911361,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Biological nitrogen fixation - the reduction of N2 to yield two moles of ammonia (NH3/ NH4+) that are available as plant nutrient - is catalyzed by the metalloenzyme, nitrogenase. The agronomic, economic, and social significance of nitrogenase can be appreciated by recognizing that the lives of about two-thirds of today's human population depend on plant growth, which relies on biologically fixed nitrogen generated by nitrogenase. The other third depends on nitrogen fixation by the industrial Haber-Bosch process, but this process is a significant component in the world's energy usage, demanding approximately 1 percent of human energy consumption. Whether the biological process can be more effectively exploited for human benefit remains an urgent question, and thus it is imperative that an understanding be achieved of the means by which organisms manage to activate and cleave N2 at ambient temperature and pressure. This project is addressing these questions through the use of electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies to characterize catalytic intermediates that form during the process of nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. ENDOR/ESEEM studies uniquely provide information about the electronic properties of the substrate-binding/reduction active site, and supply detailed structural information regarding metal-bound substrates, intermediates, and products. No other technique offers this information. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The outreach program associated with this project can be viewed (roughly) as a pyramid. At the apex are intellectual/scientific contributions to the discipline itself, and to the research community. Supporting these intellectual endeavors are contributions to the training of post doctoral scholars and graduate students, not only for this project but throughout the country and the world. The foundation level involves the encouragement of undergraduates and even high-school students, especially of women and underrepresented minorities, to participate in the scientific enterprise."
894000,"Intellectual Merit:<br/>The objective of this research is to achieve a unified molecular-level understanding of how the energy of sunlight is captured and stored via the primary electron transfer reactions in the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (RC). The RC from photosynthetic bacteria is a protein-pigment complex housing two separate but quasi-symmetric branches of cofactors (bacteriochlorophyll, derivatives of it, and quinones). In principle, either branch of pigment cofactors should be able to transport electrons. Yet in the native ""wild-type"" bacterial RC only the ""L-branch"" pigments are utilized for primary photo-induced charge separation, while the alternative, ""M-branch?, cofactors are completely inactive. During the course of the last ten years of research, electron transfer along the chain of M-branch cofactors was achieved albeit in much less than the 100% yield attained by the native L-branch. Trapping the first charge-separated state that forms on the L-branch was also achieved. This state lives less than a trillionth of a second and has only a small transient population during the normal course of native L-branch electron transfer. These advances have opened the door to a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of the origins of the unidirectional L-branch charge separation in the native RC and analogous understanding of electron transfer along the normally inactive M-branch of RC cofactors. Studies that seek these twin goals are the basis of this project. The goals will be pursued via state-of-the art time-resolved spectroscopic investigations spanning the sub-picosecond time scale (less than a trillionth of a second) to seconds. Sophisticated data analysis and computer modeling will be undertaken to compare results from various mutants with each other and the native RC. Specific interactions between the pigments and surrounding protein residues will be targeted for investigation to determine whether and how such interactions fine-tune cofactor properties and thus may serve to ""switch"" between initial L-side versus M-side electron transfer. The studies will also probe the contribution of electronic couplings between the pigments (as distinguished from issues of energetics) in controlling directionality. The combined findings will help to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of electron transfer in the bacterial RC as a unified whole. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The studies pursued in this project are relevant to understanding electron transfer in the two photosystems of plants and charge migration in membrane-bound proteins in general. Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms of photo-induced charge separation in the photosynthetic RC has fundamental and far-reaching direct impacts on synthetic systems for solar-energy harvesting/conversion (including avenues being explored by the Co-PIs), thereby addressing a national need for next-generation renewable energy sources. This project will continue to have a demonstrated positive impact on the participation of undergraduates and underrepresented groups in research and science, and in the broad multidisciplinary training of students. The integration of research ideas into teaching and educational development and dissemination to the broader community will continue to be a focus. Such projects include the following: (1) A web-based tutorial will be further developed that can be tailored for undergraduate or high school students on the topic ""Why is grass green and blood red?"" (2) Two undergraduate physical-chemistry laboratory experiments will be extensively upgraded to exploit the spectroscopy of chlorophyll and related chromophores, and the energy/electron transfer processes critical to photosynthesis, to teach molecular electronic spectroscopy and kinetics from application-oriented perspectives. In one such direct application, students will design, build, and characterize a simple solar cell. (3) A broad, science-based talk on general and fundamental aspects of photosynthesis with links to interests in gardening, global climate change, and solar energy will be developed as a program for the St. Louis Master Gardener Speaker's Bureau at the Missouri Botanical Garden. Additionally, local and national popular print and web-based publication venues will continue to be exploited through contacts with science writers in order to disseminate the goals, relevance, and applications of photosynthesis research to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This project is receiving co-funding from the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division"
631282,"Intellectual Merit: Antibodies play an important role in the immune response by recognizing foreign molecules with high affinity and specificity. It is these same properties that make them excellent affinity reagents in fields ranging from basic research to diagnostics and nanotechnology. While efforts to obtain high affinity antibodies against almost any molecule of interest are now relatively straight-forward, methods to control and regulate antibody binding have not been well explored. Regulation of protein interactions is quite common in biology and frequently involves additional equilibria that are linked to protein binding. The research objective of this CAREER project is to study single domain antibody fragments as a vehicle for understanding and applying linked equilibria in biomolecular systems. By combining recent advances in protein engineering techniques with biophysical and structural analysis, this research will explore several methods to engineer reversible control of antibody interactions through the introduction of linked equilibria. Several approaches will be explored to either reduce or enhance antibody binding under defined conditions. The resulting knowledge, methods, and reagents will help stimulate new directions in research and biotechnology by providing unique routes to control protein interactions. These results will also be of fundamental interest to researchers interested in protein design, structure/function relationships, and computational chemistry. Furthermore, these results will help improve the general understanding and teaching of molecular regulation in biology. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The educational component complements the research aims and serves to enhance training at Northern Illinois University (NIU) and the regional community. To enhance the undergraduate curriculum at NIU, an upper-level undergraduate biochemistry lab will be re-designed to incorporate inquiry-based learning approaches. These training tools will be further developed through the initiation of a web-based wiki project to serve as a training resource for the larger community of biochemical instructors and students. To help attract and retain student interest in the sciences at NIU, a new course will be developed that is aimed at exposing undergraduate students to cutting edge research at the interface of biology and chemistry. In collaboration with NIU STEM Outreach, this course will also be adapted to summer workshops for pre-college students and secondary school instructors to help increase scientific literacy. This CAREER project also includes partnerships with NIU's STEM Outreach and Latino Resource Center to provide opportunities for high school students and underrepresented undergraduate students, respectively, to perform research in the PI's laboratory."
951783,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Like a child strapped to a high-chair, some proteins are trapped in their native structure, unable to access partially and globally unfolded conformations. This may be a method used by ""mother nature"" to protect certain proteins from premature degradation, which would compromise the well being of the organism. Proteins that possess this property are described as being kinetically stable because, unlike most proteins, their long ""shelf-life"" and stability towards degradation is kinetically controlled by its very slow unfolding rate. The structural basis and biological significance of protein kinetic stability remains poorly understood. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to gain novel insight into the role of kinetically stable proteins (KSPs) in the survival and adaptation of prokaryotic thermophiles and mesophiles, and to gain enhanced understanding about the structural basis of kinetic stability. The central dogma is that bacteria possess KSPs with functions that are essential to survive in their respective environments. Novel electrophoresis methods developed in the laboratory of the Principle Investigator will be further developed and applied to: 1) characterize the proteome of KSPs in several thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria; 2) quantify the kinetic stability of hyperstable proteins directly in the cellular lysate of bacteria; and 3) construct an accessible online database of KSPs to explore the structural and functional basis of kinetic stability. It is expected that the results of this project will enhance the understanding of the biological significance of kinetic stability, and will provide a convenient and accessible assay to quantify the kinetic stability of proteins in their biological milieu. Furthermore, it will yield a wealth of accessible data that will stimulate studies to understand the biological roles of KSPs in the survival, adaptation, and evolution of thermophilic and mesophilic organisms. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>As a broader impact, this project will lead to the discovery of KSPs with potential for biotechnology applications of benefit to society. In terms of education, this project will involve postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers working together in a stimulating interdisciplinary environment that integrates training and learning. The Principal Investigator is developing a local program (RISE: Research Internship for Community College Student Engagement) for local community college students that show interest in STEM disciplines and have the academic potential and desire to transfer to a four-year university. A RISE student will participate every summer in the project and will receive mentoring and guidance throughout the process of transfer to RPI and for undergraduate studies.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Physics of Living Systems in the Physics Division and the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division."
960000,"This project applies the tools of organic chemistry to prepare specifically altered DNA sequences, either by total chemical synthesis, or by synthesis of modified DNA subunits (nucleotides) that can then be linked together by enzymes called ""DNA polymerases"" to obtain DNA molecules modified at desired locations. A variety of biophysical tools will be applied to study the effects of these modifications on DNA structure and thermodynamic stability, and the abilities of proteins (TBP, trp repressor) and minor groove binding ligands (DAPI, Hoechst 33258) to bind these modified DNA duplexes. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project will focus on two areas of modification: (i) First, minor groove functional groups in A-T rich regions will be probed by synthesizing analogues such as 3-deazaadenine or 3-deaza-3- methyladenine that are expected be disrupt binding of water molecules in the minor groove. These derivatives will be studied to assess the contribution of such water interactions to DNA structure and stability. A 3-deaza-3-hydroxymethyladenine derivative will synthesized as a modified adenosine residue with a built-in structural water analogue (hydroxymethyl group). By mimicking the water structure, studies employing this analogue are expected to provide insight into DNA helix stabilization by water groove binding. Related analogues will also provide new types of labeling sites to introduce reporter groups to the minor groove. (ii) Second, a series of pre-organized analogues will be synthesized in which the nucleobase and carbohydrate moieties are fused into a single rigid structure that maintains the conformation adopted upon duplex formation. These modifications are expected to reduce DNA single-strand flexibility, thus pre-organizing it to promote helix formation and increase helix stability. Determination of the thermodynamic parameters for duplex formation will quantify the differences between native and analogue sequences.<br/><br/>The process of designing, synthesizing, and testing new analogues to effect specific changes in DNA structure and properties will deepen our understanding of the behavior of this all important biopolymer. The students working on the project will be exposed to all aspects of the process. They will take part in the design and preparation of the requisite modified nucleoside monomers, perform the DNA synthesis and purification, and then study the properties of the analogue DNA sequence. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: (1) The modified nucleotides and DNA analogues prepared during the course of the proposed work will be made available to researchers in related fields to study the effects of these modifications on various biological processes involving DNA.

The university is making available two to three ""Lin Fellowships"" (named after a former chairman, Jeong-Long Lin) for summer-support students from underrepresented groups to work in the PI's laboratory. (3) Other outreach activities planned by PI involve relatively young children who have little to no exposure to chemistry.

826387,"Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions that are essential for industrial applications, energy conversion processes, and life. A better understanding of how enzymes perform these chemical reactions will have a major impact on a large number of scientific disciplines. In particular, deeper insight into how enzymes change their three-dimensional shape is essential to this understanding, yet in even the best characterized enzymes, the fundamental details of their molecular motions remain only crudely understood. In this project, these motions will be characterized and their role in enzyme catalytic function will be elucidated by a powerful combination of experimental and computational techniques. These experiments will be applied to the model enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) and will not only provide a better understanding of TIM enzyme function, but will also provide important information about enzymes in general that will aid research in a myriad of related scientific fields. <br/><br/>The objectives of this research are to perform outstanding science on important problems and to train young scientists to attack this and other scientific problems from a variety of experimental perspectives and furthermore, to challenge them to arrive at creative solutions. This goal will be accomplished through three approaches. (a) Teaching. Students will be educated in fundamental biophysical concepts through traditional coursework that includes detailed study of relevant scientific literature. (b) Research Mentoring. Undergraduate and graduate students will be mentored in scientific research. A particular emphasis of this project focuses on recruiting undergraduates from geographically underrepresented, rural Appalachia to participate in this research project. By including students from geographically underrepresented areas this project will enhance their educational experience and expand the training for those who would not normally have such opportunities. (c) Facilitating Group Interaction. Often, scientific problems require multiple approaches to achieve a solution. To encourage students to integrate results obtained from multiple experiments, this research project will promote interactions among students with diverse research backgrounds. To this end, weekly joint group meetings with research groups that focus on computational methods will be held."
987220,"This project integrates molecular dynamic simulation and experimental measurement to develop a dynamic model for photosynthetic electron transfer in reaction centers of the purple nonsulfur bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Current simulations on this system have suggested that the involvement of slow, collective protein modes in mediating these reactions is key, and as a result, the amount of reorganization energy available during a reaction is profoundly dependant on the time scale of the reaction, particularly as one moves from picoseconds to nanoseconds. Here, a theoretical group and an experimental group have joined forces to explore how proteins dynamics is involved to balance two competing electron transfer reactions that are critical to solar energy conversion in photosynthesis. The first is a productive electron transfer reaction that takes place on the 200 ps timescale from a bacteriopheophytin intermediate to a quinone. The second is the competing unproductive recombination reaction in which the electron returns back to the original electron donor on the 10-20 ns time scale. Simulations and measurements will be performed as a function of the driving force and temperature for these two reactions and compared directly, the goal being to understand how Nature has optimized protein structure and dynamics to promote productive photosynthetic function. A series of surface charge mutants and different pH's will be investigated, testing the concept that that the charge distribution at the protein/water interface controls the shape of the initial and final state potential surfaces, as suggested by simulation. In addition, internal mutations, thought to alter the displacement between potential surfaces, will also be investigated. The ultimate objective is to provide the capability to quantitatively predict biochemical reaction dynamics and associated function from protein structure in this complex biological system. <br/><br/>The development of a quantitative, structure-based model of the relationship between structure, dynamics and function in the photosynthetic reaction center would be broadly valuable. The reaction center in this respect represents something of a ""lab on a molecule"" with high resolution structural data and the inherent optical probes for monitoring electron transfer in considerable detail. The project will support the development of a complete, participatory learning experience for the students in the Mesa High School Biotechnology Academy, based on genetic manipulation and spectroscopic probing of photosynthetic bacteria. This will involve both teacher training in the ASU laboratories during one summer and then PIs working directly with the teachers and students in the academy to perform the activity during the subsequent years. The PIs are very heavily involved in undergraduate mentoring having had 25 undergraduates in the lab during the last 5 years."
753607,"Intellectual Merit: <br/>Protein phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism by which cells respond to environmental signals. In eukaryotes, protein phosphorylation is carried out by a large and diverse family of protein kinases, which display remarkable diversity and complexity in their modes of regulation. The complex modes of protein kinase regulation have evolved as a consequence of natural selection operating on genomic sequences for billions of years. Despite the availability of over 100,000 protein kinase sequences from diverse organisms, however, very little has been done to use the evolutionary information embedded in genomic sequences to understand the complexity and diversity of the protein kinase machinery. The overall goal of this project is to generate testable models of protein kinase evolution and regulation through quantitative and integrative analysis of protein kinase sequence, structure and functional data. Specific goals are to (i) quantify the sequence and structural similarities and differences between eukaryotic and distantly related eukaryotic-like kinases in prokaryotes, (ii) identify and experimentally characterize the evolutionary constraints acting on major protein kinase groups, in particular tyrosine kinases, which represent an important transition state in the evolution of the kinase domain, and (iii) provide conceptual representation of protein kinase sequence, structure and functional data in the form of an ontology. In order to accomplish these aims this project will use a novel evolutionary-systems approach in which mechanistic models of protein kinase regulation and evolution will be built and tested through quantitative and integrative analysis of sequence, structure and functional data. Accomplishing this project is expected to have a major impact by providing new testable hypotheses/models for experimental studies, a computational resource for large-scale integrative analysis of protein kinase data, and a conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of regulation in other signaling domains.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The major educational goal of this project is to help students develop an understanding of the importance of evolutionary and integrative approaches in biology. To accomplish this goal, the investigator will develop and assess new educational tools useful for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about data integration and data mining. These tools will be piloted, assessed, revised and broadly disseminated to undergraduate educators through web-resources and publications. The investigator will provide research training for undergraduate and high school students through existing training programs at the University of Georgia, and incorporate under-represented minorities in educational and research activities by partnering with the NSF REU Fungal Genomics and Computational Biology program. The educational activities of this project will promote inquiry-based learning at the high school and undergraduate level, and prepare the next generation of scientists for careers in integrative biology."
641375,"Intellectual Merit: The ribosome is a large, macromolecular machine found in all organisms that primarily functions to produce protein. This process, referred to as translation, is very complex and highly regulated with many accessory factors that facilitate efficient protein production. In normal translation, the ribosome translates a message by interpreting three positions on the message (RNA) into one amino acid. By advancing three positions at a time, the ribosome continues to build the protein sequence until a specific sequence on the message known as a stop codon is encountered at which point the full length protein is released from the ribosome. Often, complex three dimensional structures are present within the message and must be unwound for translation to continue. In some cases, these structures can induce the ribosome to slip back one position. This causes the ribosome to be in a different frame or frameshift and will cause the ribosome to skip over the stop codon that would have been encountered in the original frame generally producing a longer protein sequence. While much is known about frameshifting, there are still important questions that remain to be addressed in detail. In this project, the following questions related to frameshifting will be addressed by employing advanced biophysical techniques. First, the mechanism by which the ribosome unwinds complex three dimensional structures within the message in order to continue translation will be elucidated. Second, how these structures influence the global and local motions within the ribosome will be investigated. Finally, why some structures have a greater propensity to induce frameshifting than others by probing the inherent dynamic motions of a subset of structures that vary in frameshifting efficiency will be investigated. These experiments will provide a comprehensive description of unwinding and lead to a greater description of the process of frameshifting. Further, these experiments will have a profound impact on the ribosome and biophysics fields as well as a general impact on the scientific community particularly at the University of Missouri by pushing the limits and capabilities of biophysical techniques.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: With only 5.5% of the population in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the United States, it is essential that education and awareness is emphasized for both the general public and in our public schools and higher education institutions. A committment to develop and implement several specific activities that will have a direct and immediate impact in several areas with a special emphasis on underrepresented and lower income populations has been made. Education and outreach activities include: to assist with an MU teacher training program intended for grades K-8; to develop new curricula to expand the teacher training program to include high school teachers in chemistry and biochemistry with the intention of integrating cutting edge science into the classroom; to provide undergraduate research opportunities to high achieving students and to minority students preparing them for careers in STEM; to continue mentoring graduate students and encourage outreach activities; to engage in public speaking opportunities in the immediate area as well as in Universities with minimal research opportunities; and to develop undergraduate and graduate level course material that will challenge and provide hands on experience in scientific research."
538511,"Abstract<br/><br/>Intellectual merit. Proteins are complex biomolecules that regulate nearly every cellular process. A long-standing paradigm is that the structure of a protein, that is, the three-dimensional arrangement of its atoms, determines how the protein functions. Research over the past decade, however, has uncovered a vast universe of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that carry out their functions through flexible regions that do not have a well-defined three-dimensional structure. The growing recognition of the importance of IDPs is overturning long-held ideas about the connections between protein structure and protein function. In cells, protein molecules are packed tightly together leading to a phenomenon known as crowding. Crowding is known to affect structured proteins, but much less is known about the effects of crowding on IDPs. While it is clear that IDPs lack structure under pristine laboratory conditions, it is not at all clear whether such proteins remain unstructured in highly crowded environments found inside cells. Thus considerable effort has been directed at understanding the effects of crowding on IDPs. Such efforts include attempts to simulate crowding in the laboratory and efforts to probe IDPs directly in cells. Despite advances, obtaining information about IDP structure under crowded conditions remains challenging. Until this challenge is met, understanding of IDP function will be limited. Therefore, the goal of this project is to understand how crowding affects the structure and flexibility of IDPs. In this project, the effects of crowding on a panel of IDPs will be determined. The expected outcomes will be (1) new insight into the effects of crowding on IDPs and (2) transformative methodology that can be used to obtain information about the behavior of other IDPs under crowded conditions. Successful completion of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of how intrinsically disordered proteins function in the cell. <br/><br/>Broader impacts. This project will advance discovery while promoting teaching and learning by engaging both undergraduates and graduate students to answer fundamentally important questions about protein structure. The educational objective of this proposal is to enable broad dissemination of the principles of molecular structure and their impact on biology, by developing a course that increases scientific literacy, develops future science teachers, and shares knowledge with the local community. Through its educational objective, this project will have important societal benefits by broadly disseminating the principles of molecular structure to undergraduate students and the general public, by developing an understanding of how these principles apply to modern life, by supporting the development of future secondary science teachers, and by increasing understanding of scientific research. Finally, this research will broaden participation of underrepresented groups by supporting underrepresented groups in science."
778752,"Intellectual Merit.<br/><br/>While disulfide bonds are ubiquitous redox-active cofactors used in biology for catalytic, structural and signaling roles, a molecular level understanding of the principles that govern disulfide bond reactivity has proven elusive. In this work, direct electrochemistry will be used as a primary tool to characterize the influence of protein sequence and structure upon the redox properties of the thioredoxin (Trx) superfamily of proteins. Trx proteins are found throughout all the kingdoms of life: a paradigm of disulfide-based mechanisms for charge transfer and redox-homeostasis. While Trx proteins engage in diverse functions, and serve as modules that are a part of complex biological functions, there is a knowledge-gap in our understanding of how Trx proteins are tuned to be specifically reactive. Thus, this project will directly test models of how disulfide bonds are used in Biology, a question critical to many areas of biological chemistry, where the disulfide bond redox state is an essential trait to determine reactivity, signaling, and protein folding. A central question addressed in the project is, ""How does Nature tune the redox chemistry of a disulfide bond?"" In this project, the PI will (1) Assess the natural range reduction potentials found in Trx proteins, (2) Determine the influence of sequence and structure on reduction potentials, and (3) Examine the stability of disulfide-bond:iron-sulfur cluster complexes. The project involves the use of protein electrochemistry due to the highly sensitive, rapid and quantitative nature of the methodology. The results of the project will provide a new detailed understanding of how thioredoxins are used in Nature's diversity to maintain redox homeostasis.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>The most immediate impact will be upon the training of scientists at all levels (undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral faculty fellows) to think quantitatively and chemically in the field of redox biochemistry. However, due to the pervasive and central role that disulfide bond redox chemistry, redox homeostasis and oxidative stress play in the biological chemistry of all life, the broader impacts of this work will touch deeply upon the interface of chemistry and biology. Whether in plant biochemistry, bioenergy sciences or microbial physiology - thioredoxins are a paradigm of understanding how disulfide bonds are used to achieve chemical change in Life. Illuminating this process in a fundamental way will translate into new appreciation of fundamental biology.<br/>The research efforts of the PI are paired with education activities in the classroom that brings contemporary biological chemistry to the freshman chemistry audience, training of teacher-scholar postdoctoral fellows at Boston University via the Postdoctoral Faculty Fellow Program, and serving as an instructor in an upcoming graduate/postdoctoral training course in Bioinorganic Chemistry (to be held at Penn State University in 2012), which will disseminate the experimental methodologies of protein electrochemistry to a much broader audience."
885933,"This project presents a multiscale computational approach to studying the effects of the environment on protein folding and aggregation. In vivo, proteins fold in a dense environment, rich in interfaces (ranging from membranes to surfaces created by other biomolecules) and with a host of species present that can act as crowding agents. Both crowding and surface effects can dramatically alter protein folding mechanisms as well as affect aggregation pathways. Surfaces play an equally important role in aggregation processes related to biomaterial and biotechnological applications. The PI will use a combination of state of the art fully atomic enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with novel coarse-grained models that will be developed in the context of this project. The fully atomic simulations will focus on two model systems, the Islet Amyloid Polypeptide and a novel construct of the Tau protein. The folding and early aggregation of these peptides will be studied in the bulk, in the presence of solid model surfaces of different degrees of hydrophobicity (ranging from mica to graphene) and in the presence of the biologically important glycosaminoglycan heparin. Novel coarse-grained models will be developed to probe the effects of crowding and surfaces (including model membrane surfaces) on folding and aggregation. Because coarse-grained models can reach time and lengths scales that far exceed those accessible using fully atomic simulations, they enable the study of the entire aggregation process from monomer folding to full-fledged fibril formation. The proposed integrated multiscale approach aims at elucidating some of the fundamental principles that differentiate in vivo from in vitro folding.<br/><br/>A deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing protein folding and aggregation will have impacts in a number of disciplines ranging from biotechnology and biomaterials. The research is inherently interdisciplinary, and results from the simulations will be used to guide new experimental studies. All computational models and algorithms developed in the context of this project will be made freely available to the public. The PI is actively involved in the mentoring of under-represented groups in science (both minority and women) and in curricular developments. The PI is involved in chemistry outreach activities to local Santa Barbara elementary school children, including weekly science demonstrations to fifth grade students, as well as monthly ""Science Night"" events. The PI will expand her outreach to the fifth grade students by introducing new demonstration modules and by expanding the scope of the program to include a significant number of students stemming from primarily Hispanic schools. <br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division."
897873,"Many cellular processes involve interactions between proteins and DNA in which proteins recognize and bind to specific sites on the DNA with thousand- or million-fold higher affinities than to random DNA sequences. How these proteins search and find their specific sites in the midst of a large excess of nonspecific sites remains a puzzle. Many site-specific proteins kink, bend or twist DNA at that site, and exploit the sequence-dependent DNA deformability to recognize their binding site (indirect readout), and undergo conformational rearrangements to facilitate favorable interactions with the bent DNA (induced-fit). A key question remains: does the protein bend the DNA (protein-induced bending) or are partially bent conformations thermally accessible to DNA in the absence of the protein, which the protein captures to form a tight complex (conformational capture). To elucidate the interplay between these two mechanisms requires measurements of the conformational distribution of DNA, with and without bound protein, and kinetics measurements of conformational changes in protein and DNA along the transition pathway from nonspecific to specific complex. The bulk of kinetics measurements on protein-DNA complexes have come from stopped-flow measurements that were unable to capture DNA-bending kinetics, leaving unanswered even the most basic question: on what time scales does the DNA bend in the complex. A novel aspect of this project is the application of laser temperature-jump techniques to extend the time resolution for kinetics measurements to submicroseconds, which covers the time scale relevant for the recognition step. In combination with other approaches such as single-molecule FRET and picoseconds-resolved fluorescence decay measurements, this study will yield the elusive DNA bending step and the distribution of conformational states accessible to DNA, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relative contributions of conformational capture versus protein-induced bending. The study will focus on two classes of DNA-bending proteins: MutS, that recognizes mismatches in DNA and initiates the repair machinery; and EcoRV, a restriction enzyme that recognizes a specific target sequence on foreign DNA and cleaves it with high specificity. The primary goals are: to investigate whether the cognate (specific) DNA sequences have an intrinsic propensity to adopt bent conformations in the absence of bound protein; to determine whether sequence-dependent flexibility/deformability influences the rate at which DNA is bent in the complex; and to elucidate the sequence of molecular rearrangements that lead to binding site recognition. The long term goals are to extend these measurements to proteins that recognize different kinds of DNA damages, including chemically modified nucleotides, other damage repair systems, as well as other DNA-bending proteins involved in gene regulation, for a unified understanding of the role of intrinsic DNA mechanics and flexibility in the recognition mechanism. The insights gained from this study will have an impact on understanding the fundamental rules that govern indirect readout in protein-DNA interactions.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the professional training of undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral students by their involvement in research, using state-of-the-art biophysical approaches designed to unveil elusive protein-DNA dynamics. Aspects of the research will be integrated in classroom teaching at the interface of biology and physics. Experiments will be designed for undergraduates, based on the single-molecule fluorescence apparatus, which is an integral part of this project, to provide hands-on exposure to important concepts in modern biology such as diffusion, fluctuations, and correlation measurements that are typically not covered in biology or physics curricula. A new introductory biophysics course, which will integrate these and other topics, will be developed to augment a previously developed upper-level molecular biophysics course."
687763,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Plants need to respond to their surroundings and changes in their environment. As part of those responses, plants use various hormones, which are chemically unrelated to those found in animals, to alter their growth and change metabolism. Two major types of plant hormones are the jasmonates and auxins. The presence or absence of these molecules is sensed by receptors, which if bound to the hormone trigger a pattern of biological changes in the plant. This project focuses on proteins of GH3 enzyme family that chemically modify the hormones to either promote or prevent the receptor from recognizing these molecules. The GH3 proteins attach different amino acids to the hormone, which can lead to production of an active molecule, as occurs with jasmonates, or an inactive molecule, as with the auxins. Through their biochemical activity, the GH3 proteins can control if the receptor is on or off and act as pre-receptor modulators of hormone responses in plants. Although the GH3 proteins are widespread across the plant kingdom, little is known about their biochemical function. This project aims to understand the molecular structure of the GH3 proteins by using x-ray crystallography, to investigate how the GH3 proteins catalyze their reactions on chemically diverse plant hormones, and to provide insight on the physiological roles of each GH3 protein in plant hormone responses.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>Exploring the molecular foundations for control of plant hormone action will provide new insight on the biochemical networks involved in allocating resources for plant growth, pest defenses, and crop sustainability. For example, jasmonates are critical in altering metabolism of various compounds related to environmental changes, pest/pathogen defenses, and production of compounds useful for biofuels and industrial feedstocks. The project also focuses on training the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists. The research methods and questions used in this project cross the boundaries between biology, chemistry, and physics by integrating x-ray crystallography, biochemistry, and plant biology in both the lab and in teaching. In addition, to training graduate students a large portion of the broader impact efforts focus on undergraduate education. The PI actively recruits undergraduate students through undergraduate thesis work (Bio200, Bio500, and Chem490), the Washington U. HHMI-SURF, CD-BioRAP (an NSF-REU program), and the pre-freshman Summer Scholars in Biology and Biomedical Research program, and mentors high school students through the Pfizer-Solutia Summer Students and Teachers as Research Scientists (STARS) program. The PI is course-master for Bio4522: Protein Biochemistry Lab and has a record of developing research-oriented projects in undergraduate teaching lab courses (Jez et al., 2007 Biochem. Mol. Biol. Educ. and Arkus & Jez, 2008 Biochem. Mol. Biol. Educ.). Bio4522 is a research-oriented lab designed to have students progress through different stages of research to examine a scientific question and to work as a team. The success of the Spring 2010 & 2011 classes in generating some of the preliminary data on the Arabidopsis GH3 proteins for this proposal highlights the value of this approach for undergraduate education. During the timeframe of this proposal, each semester of the course will focus on investigating the development of GH3 protein function across evolution by examining these enzymes from different organisms in the Tree of Life."
622008,"Intellectual Merit<br/>In order to better understand which atoms in a protein contribute decisively to the key properties that support enzyme function, this project will generate libraries of natural proteins that contain different classes of mutations (random substitutions, glycine substitutions, backbone fission, circular permutation, insertions, and deletions) and examine how each mutation type affects protein folding and function within cells. Adenylate kinases will be used for these studies, since an abundance of pre-existing biophysical data can be tapped to interpret results from systematic mutagenesis experiments. This research will establish if the pattern of a protein's functional tolerance to different classes of mutation contains information on how different native positions within its primary sequence contribute to structure, stability, folding, dynamics, and function. This experimental strategy will be potentially useful for studying any protein for which an in vivo screen is available, including poorly behaved proteins that cannot readily be examined by in vitro physical methods. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>This broader impact of this project will be to provide training for graduate and undergraduate students interested in science careers. The PI and graduate students performing this research will conduct annual round table discussions for undergraduates enrolled at a nearby community college. These community college students begin their education in lecture courses and are not necessarily exposed to an environment that mirrors a research lab. Round table discussions will be used to increase student self-confidence by showing beginning college students that they can read a peer-reviewed research article, demonstrate to these students the benefits of research training, and facilitate community college student recruitment to research experiences. These efforts will vertically integrate undergraduate and graduate education by providing beneficial training for graduate students, building self-sustaining outreach from a research university to a minority serving community college, and offering research experiences for community college students."
562801,"Membrane proteins play important roles in many vital cellular processes, such as transmembrane (TM) signaling, transport of ions and small molecules, energy transduction, and cell-cell recognition. This project seeks to acquire novel insights into membrane proteins, dynamics and interactions with lipids, which are important determinants of their functions. Despite impressive successes of X-ray crystallography in structure determination of membrane proteins with multiple TM helices, it is still challenging to obtain the structural information of membrane proteins with one or a few TM helices. These membrane proteins are abundant and often involved in important TM-induced signaling and regulation through formation of hetero-/homo-oligomers. Although difficulties exist in obtaining inter-helix distance information by measuring long-range NOEs for these membrane proteins, their structures are determinable by measuring various orientational NMR observables, such as chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and dipolar coupling (DC) in solid-state NMR (ssNMR), and residual dipolar coupling (RDC) in solution NMR experiments. However, the present NMR structure determination methods for membrane proteins are not able to extract important dynamics and interaction information that possibly are embedded in time- and ensemble-averaged NMR observables. This project will fill the knowledge gap by utilizing the orientational NMR restraint potentials to use the available experimental observables with additional benefits from the realistic molecular dynamics simulation of membrane systems. The ssNMR ensemble dynamics technique recently developed in the investigator's research group will make it possible to extract the intrinsic dynamics and/or distinct configurations of different domains. Comparisons of the free energy calculation results along key TM helix motions with NMR observable-based structure refinement and ensemble dynamics results will offer cross-validation of membrane proteins, structures and dynamics from different approaches. This research with selected complex membrane protein models will enhance our understanding of structure, dynamics, and function of membrane proteins with one or a few TM helices and their oligomers.<br/><br/>This project also seeks to foster synergistic scientific research and education by providing reliable and general computational methods to students and researchers in the membrane protein NMR field and other disciplines through the CHARMM-GUI website (www.charmm-gui.org), which has been developed in the investigator's research group. In addition to graduate student training, undergraduate students will be involved in the proposed research to promote their interests in computational biophysics. In addition, this project will raise the scientific literacy of the public through the publication of research results and workshop participation. Finally, this project will help further development of our summer program called ""Summer Research Program for HIgh School Students (SURPHISS) in Molecular Modeling and Simulations"" by supporting graduate and undergraduate students interested in the education of high school students."
615503,"Intellectual Merit: <br/>Iron is a required nutrient involved in fundamental cellular processes, from oxygen storage and transport to respiration and DNA repair. Pathogenic bacteria are equipped with iron uptake mechanisms that enable them to utilize host-iron sequestered by lactoferrin, transferrin or bound to heme, and therefore overcome the low-iron concentrations encountered in their host organisms. Much less is known about the fate of iron once it reaches the bacterial cytosol. Ferritin molecules function as dynamic regulators of cytosolic iron concentrations, but despite their importance in iron homeostasis, little is known about the processes that deliver Fe2+ for storage or the signals that prompt its release for safe integration in metabolism. There are two ferritin-like molecules in P. aeruginosa: a bacterioferritin (BfrB), which assembles from 24 identical subunits and binds 12 heme molecules, and a bacterial ferritin (FtnA), which is also assembled from 24 identical subunits but does not bind heme. It has recently been discovered that release of iron from BfrB requires electrons to be mediated by a ferredoxin (Bfd) and a ferredoxin reductase (FPR), whereas release of iron from FtnA requires that electrons be mediated only by FPR. These findings provide a unique platform to study how protein structure and protein-protein interactions contribute to the regulation of cytosolic iron in pathogenic bacteria. In order to investigate these protein-protein interactions a multidisciplinary approach will be undertaken which includes biochemistry, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and computational biology. The specific goals are: 1) Investigate and structurally determine the protein-protein interactions that regulate the outflow of iron from the interior cavities of BfrB and FtnA. (2) Challenge a hypothesis that Fe2+ exits the BfrB and FtnA interior cavities via the four-fold pores formed in their structures at the intersection of 4-subunits.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The multidisciplinary nature of the project will provide many opportunities for students at all academic levels. The integration of efforts in the Rivera, Vakser and Lovell laboratories (all located at the University of Kansas) via monthly joint group meetings will expose the students to the intellectually diverse atmosphere that is necessary to nurture multidisciplinary research. This experience, coupled to the ethnically rich environment present in the three labs (Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic; ~40/60 female/male) will prepare the graduate students well for the multifaceted work environment they are likely to encounter after graduation. Just as important, the collaborative spirit of this project will illustrate to students the benefits of a broad-based approach for (1) solving complex problems; (2) more effectively putting the results obtained in one laboratory into its proper context; and thus (3) improving the prospect that the research will impact the greater scientific community, and ultimately benefit the general public.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division."
657070,"Proteins are molecular machines that contribute to virtually every activity of every biological system. Regulation of their activity is a principal goal of drug and protein design. But we do not yet know enough about how proteins function to efficiently design molecules that modulate their activities. We know that to function they need to change their shape - alter their conformation - but visualizing these changes in shape is a substantial experimental challenge. The approach we will take here is to attempt to characterize the set of all shapes a protein can take on - its full conformational ensemble. This will provide a critical link between structure, dynamics and function. The problem is that in a drop of solution, there is a multitude of proteins, each of which may have a different conformation. We will alter the relative abundance of each conformation under many different experimental conditions and collect wide-angle x-ray solution scattering (WAXS) data from the protein under each of those conditions. Using advanced signal processing techniques, we will then extract from these data the scattering due to each conformation individually. This will provide direct structural information on the conformations of functional intermediates that never occur in solution in the absence of other conformations. The result will be a map of the conformational changes that occur during protein action, providing direct experimental evidence for understanding the way proteins use conformational changes to carry out their functions. <br/><br/>The project will make extensive use of state-of-the-art signal processing techniques that are well known in engineering but used sparingly in biophysics. This exemplifies a rapidly accelerating trend to data-rich scientific inquiry powered by increasing use of automatic data capture. Science is becoming ever more dependent on sophisticated methods of signal and data analysis. Training of scientists in advanced data processing techniques will be an essential part of this transition. In this project, success will depend on cross-disciplinary training of both scientists and engineers; training that starts with the PI's - who are already learning from one another - continues with graduate students involved in the research, and extends to graduate students and undergraduates who will benefit from the cross-disciplinary courses that we will create. Underrepresented groups will be introduced to this approach through research experiences for undergraduates and K12 teachers and outreach to K12 students - activities that will constitute an integral part of this project and be designed to encourage and prepare students for careers in science or science teaching."
625000,"Fungi comprise one of the most successful groups of life on Earth. They inhabit most of the world's environments, where they perform numerous functions (e.g., nutrient cycling, foundations of food webs, etc.) that are central to healthy ecosystems. Importantly, fungi interact with all other forms of life, including plants, animals and bacteria -- in associations that range from beneficial to antagonistic. Zygomycete fungi, the focus of this research project, are an ancient group in which most of the morphological and ecological traits associated with Kingdom Fungi first arose, but their evolutionary history and ecological associations have not yet been well resolved. This project will reconstruct the genealogical relationships of this earliest branch in fungal evolutionary history, resolve the origins of symbiotic relationships between plants and zygomycetes, reveal how complex body plans evolved in the group, elucidate mechanisms of mating genetics between organisms with complex and differing life cycles, and develop genomic barcodes to facilitate identification of unknown fungi. The results of this research will contribute to many scientific disciplines and to society. Expanding and maintaining expertise on these fungi is critical for the field of biology, human health and productivity, and safe food production. This project includes training of the next generation of mycologists, dissemination of information on basic fungal biology, development of teaching resources, expansion of biological database and web resources, development of research materials including strain cultures and genomes for the wider scientific community, and broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Zygomycetes are filamentous fungi that lack flagella and that produce simple but defined reproductive structures. An initial analysis of zygomycete genomes support the hypothesis that the group is a pivotal transition point between certain flagellated Fungi and their specific life histories, and what became the dominant eukaryotic terrestrial clade of Fungi (the fleshy fungi, e.g., mushrooms). Because the zygomycetes are the first terrestrial fungi that exhibit fruiting bodies, understanding how these structures evolved will provide a basis for understanding the origins of complex morphogenesis (e.g., multicellularity) in the Fungi, as well as the evolution of complex life histories. Zygomycetes also display a diversity of ecological relationships with plants (mycorrhizae), animals (pathogens) and bacteria (endosymbionts). Resolving the phylogenetic origins of these interactions will provide an evolutionary framework for elucidating molecular and biochemical mechanisms that govern these interactions, and in doing so, will have direct impacts on research into natural and managed ecosystems and human welfare. This research will also refine molecular environmental sampling techniques, resulting in a more accurate census of zygomycete biodiversity, especially in soil ecosystems. By gathering orders of magnitude more genome-scale data and integrating it with biochemical, morphological, subcellular, and fossil data layers, this elusive region of the fungal genealogy of life will be illuminated and will provide a foundation for broad scale biological research."

916015,"Terrestrial plants regulate their interactions with the environment via insoluble hydrophobic molecules assembled within epidermal or peridermal cell walls: cutins, suberins, and waxes that share some building blocks and formation pathways. To understand the macromolecular structure and mechanical performance of these essential protective membranes, gene-silenced tomato fruits and potato tubers as well as leaves from several model plants will be targeted for study. A coordinated protocol of biophysical measurements will link the biosynthesis of plant coverings with their molecular architectures and macroscopic attributes such as mechanical integrity and environmental persistence. The project can benefit food crop yields and recycling of plant litter, also aiding the design of paints, textiles, and coatings. Interdisciplinary training teams spanning high school through postdoctoral levels will conduct this research, which will also form the basis of an undergraduate laboratory curriculum for non-scientists.<br/><br/>The long-term objective of this program is to transform the current phenomenology of protective plant cuticles and periderms into a comprehensive predictive scheme for the versatile barrier functions of hydrophobic membranes. In addition to benefits related to food crop protection and plant litter recycling, the project outcomes can inform the design of superhydrophobic paints, textiles, and coatings. Recent improvements in genetic, analytical, and biomechanical technologies are making it possible to achieve an understanding of plant cuticular architecture that spans length scales from molecular to macroscopic, development from biosynthesis to biodegradation, and mechanical integrity at the surface or in bulk. This project will examine the biosynthesis, macromolecular organization, and mechanical performance of cuticles and periderms from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants with known genomes. As a complement, the polymers that resist chemical degradation and modulate plant cuticular function will be identified structurally. Specific hypotheses will be tested to address several issues: specificity of two fruit cutin synthase enzymes; metabolic rerouting of gene-silenced potato tuber periderms; macromolecular organization of suberized potato cell walls; nanomechanics and tensile strength of cuticles and periderms, respectively; environmental persistence of cutins and suberins."
645394,"Co-PIs Gurmukh (Guri) Johal (Purdue University) and Brian Dilkes (Purdue University)<br/><br/>There are many diseases that can infect crop plants, leading to lower yields and even crop loss. The ability of crop plants to fight off diseases is therefore a very important agricultural trait. Farmers can avoid some diseases with pesticides, or breeders can develop crop varieties that resist diseases. Crops have the ability to fight off diseases by reacting to the disease-causing microorganism with defensive mechanisms, known as the plant hypersensitive response (HR). This refers to a process whereby an infected cell dies before the infection can spread to other cells in the plant. Despite its importance to maintain healthy crops, much remains unknown about the HR. In this work, a multi-disciplinary approach involving a number of field and lab-based techniques will be used to gain a better understanding of the HR in corn, the most economically valuable crop in the US. The genes and processes involved in controlling the HR will be identified and characterized. While this work will be performed primarily in corn, it is likely that many features of the HR are shared among different crops. As such this work will provide fundamental insights into one of the most important ways plants defend themselves against diseases, and the knowledge will be useful to develop improved crop plants by making them more resistant to diseases. Outreach activities with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will focus on educational activities on genetics, plant breeding, biotechnology and associated societal implications and will build on an existing collaboration with the museum that has developed several instructional modules for middle, high school, home school and mature students and their teachers. These continuing programs will be supported and several new programs will be developed around DNA sequence analysis, biotechnology and society.<br/><br/>In previous work, a novel genetic screen was used to identify loci, genes and pathways associated with natural genetic variation that controlled HR. In this project, a multi-disciplinary approach involving mutagenesis, field genetics, high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic sequencing, metabolomics, bioinformatics, microscopy and molecular biology will be used to gain an understanding of the HR from molecular genetic, transcriptional, biochemical and histological perspectives. Genes and pathways controlling the HR response will be identified and characterized. The HR will be observed at cellular, transcriptional and metabolic levels. The utility of a novel and potentially widely-applicable approach for the identification and characterization of mutations conferring quantitative phenotypes will be demonstrated. Public access to sequencing data generated this project will be made possible through deposition at the Short Read Archive (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). Information on the position of genes controlling the HR at the transcriptional level (expression Quantitative Trait Loci ? eQTL) will be made available at MaizeGDB (maizegdb.org).

Solid-state magnetic resonance experiments will provide crucial benchmarks for the validation and integration of theory, computation and experiment. The experiments will employ a novel ?host? peptide design, in which minimal numbers of chemically distinct aromatic amino acid residues serve to position a tilted transmembrane helix near a ?tipping point? in lipid bilayer membranes. Within this context, the systematic incorporation of specific ionizable (potentially charged) ?guest? residues will provide important new insights concerning ionization behavior and protein-lipid molecular interactions that are essential for the biological functions of many classes of membrane proteins. In addition to fundamental insights about lipids and proteins, the project will advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms that may govern the functioning of potassium channels, acetylcholine receptors and integrins, among other membrane proteins. <br/><br/>The project will extend longstanding commitments to community outreach and early involvement of undergraduate students in cutting-edge research. An overarching goal is the recruitment of new creative minds to lifelong careers dedicated to scientific discovery, while at the same time broadening the base for participation of non-traditional individuals and underrepresented groups in science. The project will contribute and enhance the undergraduate research opportunities?beginning at the freshman and sophomore levels. Additional efforts are devoted to the coordination of a statewide infrastructure for undergraduate research in Arkansas, a community Science Café and a protein virtual reality lab."
890800,"Project title: Conformational flexibility in Beclin 1, an evolutionarily-conserved, key autophagy protein<br/><br/>Autophagy is a critical cell survival pathway responsible for nutrient recycling due to degradation of unwanted, damaged or harmful cellular components. Autophagy plays an important role in several key organismal processes including embryonic development, tissue differentiation, cell-growth, as well as surviving environmental stress and internal stressors like damaged organelles, mutant proteins, free radicals and intracellular pathogens. Beclin1, a protein essential for autophagy, has been directly implicated in these processes. This research will focus on understanding the atomic-resolution structure and flexibility of Beclin1 to provide a better understanding of its critical role in autophagy and cellular maintenance. This project will provide graduate and undergraduate students in North Dakota an unprecedented opportunity to train in classical and cutting edge methods of biophysical and biochemical research, and also have a substantial impact outside the laboratory by educating high-school teachers about biomacromolecular structure and function. Over the period of this project, 40 high-school science teachers will participate in a summer professional development course to help them instruct their students in understanding the structures of biomacromolecules such as proteins and DNA. Thus, the educational activities outlined in this project are designed to educate and mentor students at all levels: high school, undergraduate and graduate; and will have a broader impact far beyond the grant funding period.<br/><br/>Beclin1 appears to be a protein interaction hub for autophagy as it binds to over twenty diverse cellular proteins. The research goal of this project is to better understand how Beclin 1 interacts with so many different partners by establishing its structure and conformational flexibility and identifying residues that are key for function. Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy will be used to assess secondary structure content, backbone flexibility and dynamic conformational changes. High-resolution structures will be determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. Small-angle X-ray scattering will be used to obtain low-resolution structural information such as size, oligomerization and molecular envelopes. Combined information from these methods will be used to derive a pseudo-atomic model of full-length Beclin1. The role of motifs and conserved residues in binding will be examined using isothermal titration calorimetry to quantify the thermodynamics of interaction and by cellular assays to assess the impact of mutations on cellular autophagy levels and binding of selected key autophagy proteins. Last, but not least, this research will provide substantial information about poorly understood intrinsically disordered regions and help establish methodology essential for investigating such regions."

To achieve this, breeders cross a wild variety to a crop variety. The result is called a hybrid, and it mixes genes from both parents. Most of the genes from the wild variety, however, are unsuited for agriculture and must be cast away. This is done by repeated crossing to the crop variety, coupled to selection for the trait of interest, a process called backcrossing that often requires as many as 10 years. This constitutes a dramatic bottleneck to developing new varieties. Therefore, shortening the development time is particularly critical in the face of unexpected crop challenges when human sustenance depends on the rapid development of new, improved varieties. This project addresses this need. It aims at developing a method for rapid deployment of useful traits into crops, using potato as the experimental system. The collaboration between University of California-Davis and the International Potato Center will also train graduate and undergraduate students in genomic-based breeding. The method developed will be applicable in many crop species and will be useful for both basic and applied research.<br/><br/>Haploid induction, a process that generates plants with a single genome instead of the two parental ones, can significantly shorten the time it takes to make new varieties. However, no methods have resolved the problem of overcoming linkage drag, the common, negative association of deleterious genes with desirable ones. The project team discovered a method to facilitate the transfer of selected genomic regions to a target variety, providing a novel solution to make breeding faster and more efficient. The work plan combines rapid testing in the model plant Arabidopsis with exploration of natural and engineered haploid inducer systems in potato to develop methods for rapid and simple introgression of new traits in crops. The specific objectives are to 1) Exploit and develop haploid induction systems in potato, based on the S. tuberosum phureja haploid inducer as well as on manipulation of centromeric histone H3. 2) Engineer introgression of defined chromosomal segments from a donor to a recipient genome using different types of recombination mechanisms. Useful potato and Arabidopsis lines produced by this work will be deposited in, respectively, GRIN NRSP-6 (http://www.ars-grin.gov/nr6/) and the ABRC (https:/www.arabidopsis.org/) stock centers. Progress and resources will also be linked from the Principal Investigator's web site (http://comailab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/)."
587281,"Intrinsic Disorder, Energetic Coupling and Allostery<br/><br/>The current project investigates the role of protein intrinsic disorder (ID) in mediating signaling in the transcription factor family of proteins, a process known as allostery. By measuring the stability and DNA binding affinity for a number of naturally occurring variants of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcription factor and comparing these values to the transcriptional activity in cells, this project provides a framework for understanding allosteric signaling in proteins containing ID. The resulting experimental data will be used to construct a quantitative, predictive model of allostery. The intellectual merits of the proposed activities are two-fold. First these studies provide the first systematic analysis of ID-mediated allostery using both biophysical studies and live cell assays of function. Second, these studies challenge a recently developed ensemble allosteric model designed to quantitatively characterize allostery in terms of the intrinsic stabilities of cooperative elements of structure and the interaction energies between them. As such, this research represents an advance over previous qualitative and largely speculative models for ID function, and provides one of the first quantitative descriptions of how and why proteins use intrinsic disorder.<br/><br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project are two-fold, and focus on research, education and the bridge between these two activities. First, the primary goal of the research is to experimentally determine the allosteric control present in GR. However, GR shares architecture with the estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), androgen (AR), and vitamin D (VDR) receptors, all of which play a vital role in hormone-dependent cell signaling and regulation. As such, insights gained from the current research will directly impact understanding in these other systems. Second, a key objective of the research is to derive a quantitative model that is subject to simulation and validation. As part of two previous NSF proposals, the Principal Investigator has developed a significant amount of computer-based course work focuses on modeling of dynamic biological systems. The models developed as part of the current research will be directly integrated into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum at Johns Hopkins University, and thus will not only play a vital role in the education of biology students, it will significantly expand the biology students? access to computational methods and technologies."
631999,"The objective of this CAREER project is to develop and apply new theoretical methods and molecular simulation techniques to characterize the denatured states and to discern residue-specific electrostatic contributions to the stability of model proteins including NTL9, HP36 and leucine zippers. This research will tackle two outstanding problems that hamper theoretical studies of denatured and disordered proteins, namely, the lack of rigorous means to validate microscopic information and the problem of force field bias. Electrostatic interactions play an important role in biological functions. However, the current knowledge of electrostatic effects is incomplete. This is because experimental techniques cannot isolate electrostatic contributions, while the accuracy of existing theoretical studies is insufficient. The developed simulation tools and software will be disseminated to the community to advance atomic-level studies of electrostatic phenomena and many important biological processes involving denatured states and disordered proteins.<br/><br/>To help prepare a new generation of work force with state-of-the-art scientific knowledge as well as critical thinking and problem solving skills, the PI will develop new curricula that integrate classroom teaching and hands-on research projects. The broader educational impacts also include a web site (http://computchem.org) dedicated to students who are interested in learning and applying theoretical and computational tools to problems in the cross-disciplinary areas of biology, chemistry, and physics. Modern communication tools such as Blogs, Forums, Wikis, and Media are offered to promote peer learning and knowledge sharing in a world-wide community. The PI will give seminars and host summer interns to further enhance learning experience and to increase participation of underrepresented minority students."
924022,"The major goal of this research project, jointly funded by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of MCB and Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics, is to understand the role of charge-charge interactions in determining the thermodynamic stability of proteins and modulation of the folding energy landscape. It relies on the synergy between computer simulations and experiments. This study will test the hypothesis that charge-charge interactions on the protein surface are important determinants of the folding energy landscape. Approaches developed during the previous funding cycle significantly advanced the ability to predict the effects of surface charge-charge interactions on protein stability and provided an important tool that allows the combination of computer simulations, inspired by the energy landscape theory, with experimental measurements of the rates for protein folding/unfolding. Specific questions that will be addressed are: What is the role of charge-charge interactions in shaping the folding energy landscape? What is the effect that electrostatic interactions have on defining the protein kinetic stability? What is the role of salt-bridges in defining the stability of collagen molecule? <br/><br/>The PI is actively involved in curriculum development and serves as an Undergraduate curriculum adviser for Biochemistry and Biophysics majors at RPI. In addition he engages high school, undergraduate and graduate students in both computational and experimental aspects of research in his laboratory. Over 50% of trainees are females or members of underrepresented minorities. The majority of the high-school and undergraduate students who were trained in the lab continue their education in STEM disciplines. The research will provide a systematic study of the mechanism of protein stabilization by charge-charge interactions by uniquely combining a variety of biochemical, biophysical and computational tools. As such, it is expected that the knowledge accumulated as a result of these experiments will lay the foundation to future studies of these fundamentally important issues with broad implications for many different areas of biotechnology that use proteins including development of next generation of biosensors, environmentally friendly catalysts and robust biomaterials."
702348,"Protein folding is perhaps the most fundamental of all protein functions. Protein folding is a difficult process and is potentially dangerous when it goes wrong. Correct folding and misfolding are key to the function of all cells and to maintain health. Yet there is still no general agreement about how this basic process works: do proteins fold through discrete well defined intermediates in discrete pathways, as in the classical view, or do they fold by way of multiple independent unrelated pathways as in the so-called new view. This work uses a powerful new approach developed in the last award to understand the protein folding problem, and is likely to provide the insightful information to define the folding process in some detail and answer key questions in the field. These studies will engage and actively train, teach, and support postdoctoral, undergraduate, and high school students in active hands-on research at the forefront of modern structural biology. <br/><br/>Naturally occurring protein hydrogen exchange (HX) behavior is very sensitive to the biophysical properties that allow protein molecules to accomplish their myriad biological functions. It has therefore been able to contribute importantly to protein science research, especially when measured by NMR at amino acid resolution. However NMR is limited to the study of relatively small proteins in quantity at high concentrations. Recent work in the PI's laboratory has developed an advanced mass spectrometry analysis (HX MS) that can measure HX at near amino acid resolution in large and complex protein systems in previously unreachable situations using minuscule amounts of biological material. This technique will be used to study the protein folding problem, which lies at the base of many important problems in biological science. The detailed mechanism of protein folding itself is not understood, mainly because transient folding intermediates and folding pathways are beyond the reach of the usual high resolution structural methods. The newly advanced HX MS technology is able to track the kinetic folding process and describe the intermediate forms and pathways that carry an initially unfolded protein to its final native state. In the proposed work, HX MS technology will be used to ask how proteins fold, why they fold in that way, and how helper chaperone molecules function to promote folding. The how question will be addressed in studies of a biologically typical large protein, unlike almost all previous studies (both theoretical and experimental) which have been directed at small proteins that account for only a few percent of the biological proteome. The why question will be addressed by studying at high structural resolution the folding of laboratory-designed proteins that have not been shaped and selected through biological evolution. Chaperone function will be addressed by studying the detailed folding of a protein while it is contained within the active GroEL chaperonin cavity. This work may well change the current protein folding paradigm and, more broadly, will provide a powerful new tool for protein structure-function studies that have simply not been possible before. This work is being funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division of BIO, and co-funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division of MPS."
720000,"MIOX is the founding and, to date, only established member of the nascent mixed-valent di-iron oxygenase (MVDO) sub-family. It uses a Fe2(II/III) cofactor to activate O2 at the Fe(II) site and myo-inositol at the Fe(III) site for a C-C-bond-cleaving, four-electron oxidation. A recent paper and our preliminary data on the P-C-bond cleaving enzyme, PhnZ, strongly suggest it is the second example of an MVDO, and our analysis of available sequences and structures suggests that several other proteins belong to this class. The mapping of the phosphohydrolase-MVDO boundaries in the HD-domain superfamily and characterization of new MVDOs will facilitate proper functional assignment, expand the known catalytic repertoire of this new class of oxygenase, and shed light on Nature's evolution of radically divergent functions within a common protein scaffold. The project will likely uncover fundamentally new reactions that will expand the known catalytic repertoire of a novel class of oxygenase that at present consists of just a single documented member. It will yield insight into how Nature remodels a protein scaffold and its metallocofactor in seemingly subtle ways to create markedly different catalytic activities. Thus this project addresses two central challenges in molecular biosciences: (1) functional assignment of the huge number of proteins predicted within the terabases of available DNA sequence and (2) understanding the evolution of new functions within a ""superfamily"" of proteins sharing a common architecture. It will also provide outstanding training in activities ranging from bioinformatic analysis, to analytical and protein biochemistry, to enzyme kinetics and mechanism, to protein crystallography, to biological spectroscopy. The scientific project will infuse the primary outreach activity, a ~120-participant, biennial training ""workshop"" in modern metallobiochemistry, with new case studies illustrating important concepts, and efforts to extract such concepts and develop new case studies will sharpen the scientific focus of the trainees."
540000,"Intellectual Merit:<br/>Plants must respond to environmental cues like light to survive and flourish. Light sensors enable plants to react to sunlight by triggering photosynthesis, UV sunscreen protection, and appropriate light-activated growth and development (photomorphogenesis). The plant UVR8 UV-B photoreceptive system initiates stress responses to promote survival using a novel tryptophan pyramid as the intrinsic chromophore, then couples signaling interactions to trigger massive gene expression changes. This light-activated system, investigated by the application of state-of-the-art biophysical techniques and a transdisciplinary approach will enable a mechanistic understanding of a prototypic biological response pathway. Building on the first crystallographic and solution structures of UVR8 determined in the Getzoff lab, this research will integrate structural biology expertise in X-ray crystallography and solution scattering; building of comprehensive biochemical models; spectroscopy to assay light-activated mechanisms and phenotypes; and strategic cross-disciplinary collaborations with plant biologists to inform and be informed by molecular genetics in plants. The results will provide plant biologists with a molecular-level appreciation of photomorphogenesis. Characterization of UVR8 partners will provide information on structure, interactions and activities of the beta-propeller WD40 domain, one of the top-ten most abundant folds in eukaryotic genomes. The resulting mechanistic understanding of how plants respond to sunlight provides insights into how crops will react to climate change and to increased radiation resulting from depletion of atmospheric ozone.<br/><br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This project will bring science into the classroom by providing genuine research experience to high school students. Learning molecular biology techniques in their own lab, these students participate by making structure-based mutants; growing protein crystals and seeing tangible outcomes relevant to environmental problems. Thus, students actively apply the scientific method and learn how to test biological hypotheses experimentally. This project will facilitate continued PI involvement in the interdisciplinary graduate program and support participation of underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. In the lab, students and post-doctoral fellows will be trained in contributing to interdisciplinary, international collaborations and mentoring junior interns in projects involving the UVR8 plant photoresponse system."
660027,"Intellectual Merit:<br/>Two metal-containing, multi-heme respiratory enzymes involved in the interconversion of ammonia and nitrite, an important stage in the biological nitrogen cycle, are being investigated. Cytochrome c nitrite reductase from Shewanella oneidensis catalyzes the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia during anaerobic respiration. Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase from nitrosomonas europaea catalyzes the four-electron oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite, as part of a larger process in which ammonia is oxidized to nitrite during aerobic respiration. Under non-physiological conditions, hydroxylamine oxidoreductase can also reduce nitrite to ammonia similar to cytochrome c nitrite reductase, while cytochrome c nitrite reductase can oxidize hydroxylamine to nitrite. The primary aim of the project is to determine how the proteins, which have broadly similar architectures, are tailored to shepherd the ammonia-nitrite interconversion preferentially in one direction or the other. The immediate focus is on the mechanism of the multi-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia by ccNiR. Intermediate states that form and decay during the reactions catalyzed by cytochrome c nitrite reductase are being investigated with the use of a variety of spectroscopic, electrochemical and structural techniques, most notably Laue X-ray crystallography and Laue-based time-resolved crystallography. These relatively new techniques have enormous untapped potential. The development of these techniques is an important complementary part of the project. The research outcome will provide a better understanding of the notoriously complicated redox chemistry of nitrogen at enzymatic metal centers. <br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/>The project's highly interdisciplinary nature provides the students in research training with a wide breadth of skills that would make them very competitive when they go on to independent careers after graduation. The project will involve an average of three undergraduate researchers per year, in addition to two high school students and two high school teachers who will perform summer research. The graduate students funded to work on this project will also provide direct supervision for many of the undergraduates and one high school student and teacher. The project also provides insight into the growing environmental problem of nitrogen cycle imbalance. Ammonia (a major component of fertilizer) and nitrite are two examples of ""reactive nitrogen;"" that is, nitrogen usable by many living organisms, as opposed to ""elemental nitrogen"" which makes up 78% of the air we breathe, but is directly usable by only a few bacteria. Over the last 50 years the balance between reactive and elemental nitrogen has shifted significantly towards the former, as more fertilizer was generated to produce food and (recently) biofuels. This shift is having many unintended negative consequences, which will soon have to be mitigated. A better understanding of ammonia-nitrite interconversion would lead to the more efficient use of ammonia fertilizer, and thus help redress the imbalance."
945650,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Our reliance upon the wonderful diversity of plant life worldwide is manifested in many ways, whether as sources of foodstuffs, structural building materials and fibers, or intermediate, specialty, and medicinal chemicals for everyday use. Of particular importance is to understand how plants produce many of these valuable plant natural products and materials generated via intermediacy of highly reactive intermediates in their biochemical conversions, through so-called free radical chemistries. A key way in which these remarkable biochemistries evolved was recently identified, with the discovery of Dirigent Proteins (Latin, dirigere, to guide or align). In this way, plants produce not only some of nature's most important compounds, such as lignans for plant defense, but also others highly valued and widely used by humanity. In the project, how these remarkable proteins exercise and dictate control over the highly reactive free radical chemistries will be investigated. This requires technologies using the most advanced instrumentation worldwide to probe dirigent protein structures and mechanisms of action, including state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. In this way, both their structure determinations and elucidation of how these proteins carry out these remarkable conversions will be enabled. It is generally accepted that the dirigent proteins have an unique biochemical mechanism, and it is now urgent to comprehensively unravel the underlying key details. Another emphasis will be to use the information gained to provide a new protein source, from cottonseed, able to satisfy food requirements for 8.5 million people daily through better understanding of these remarkable free radical chemistries in dirigent protein mediated conversions.<br/><br/>Broad impact<br/>Project activities are also deeply committed to helping solve societal challenges by providing the needed exposure of interested students at all stages of their development (high school, undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctorals), in order to inspire this upcoming generation (including various minority groups) to pursue a science career. The approach thus includes providing comprehensive and varied research experiences through internships and exposing them to different opportunities in the Life Sciences. In particular, emphasis will be given to exposure of students to the rapid technological developments that have occurred in science, which seamlessly link various disciplines ranging from plant sciences to computer science/bioinformatics. This will include their participation in inspirational research projects and one-on-one mentoring. Support to further the important role of science worldwide will be made in the form of presentations/workshops/lectures to high schools, various public gatherings, industry, science centers, federal and state delegations, as well as through international gatherings of many different types."

Enzymes can be considered to be a type of 'nanomachine', and just like every day machines, enzymes have moving parts that are predicted to be important for their function. The main research goal of this project is to understand the relationships between internal protein fluctuations and enzyme catalysis. More specifically, NMR-based methodology will be implemented to rigorously quantify the relationship between the internal motions of the enzyme indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase and the conformational dynamics of its substrate to provide deeper insight into the role protein motions play in directing the chemical step(s) of enzyme catalysis. Mutational analysis of amino acids predicted to be important in the regulation and coordination of internal protein motions will further reveal how internal protein fluctuations couple to chemically relevant substrate motions. The results for this model enzyme system will be applicable to the basic understanding of protein motion and enzyme catalysis. The results will also provide a more thorough understanding of the design and development of novel enzyme catalysts, such as those used in many industrial processes and products, and can provide further direction to the design of small molecule biomimetic catalysts that take advantage of the basic catalytic principles outlined here. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The integrated education objectives of this project are to develop, direct and disseminate enzyme-based demonstrations and inquiry-based activities to educate diverse audiences about enzyme technology, and to inspire underrepresented middle and high school students to pursue STEM education and careers, especially in the fields of chemistry and biology. Students will participate through the Higher Achievement Program that brings students from non-college, minority families in the Washington, D.C. area to Penn State, and Penn State Family Science Night that brings science demonstrations and hands-on activities to underserved rural school districts in Pennsylvania. Rural-based teachers (grades 6-12) will be brought to Penn State to participate in enzyme-related demonstrations through the Penn State STEM Teacher Academy. Demonstration and related materials will be made available through Teacher's Domain that is accessed by teachers across the U.S. and in 163 other countries. The ultimate goals of these activities will be to increase participation of underrepresented student populations, enhance educational infrastructure through the creation of digital learning objects, and advance the training and development of middle and high school science teachers."
750000,"Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>Understanding how to redesign enzymes to function at different temperatures is critical to increasing the efficiency of many industrial processes including the production of biofuels. It is also crucially important to understanding the basic principles of protein folding, adaptation, and stability. This project tests and applies two novel hypotheses in protein adaptation and stability: 1) that protein adaptation is ""Fold-Specific,"" meaning that the molecular adaptation strategy taken to alter an enzyme's temperature range is dependent on its specific enzymatic fold and 2) that increases in the stability of the native state of a protein can be achieved by limiting the conformations accessible in the unfolded state through steric exclusion of non-native like conformations - a novel mechanism termed 'Entropic Stabilization.' Already, many mutations that have no apparent effect on the folded state structure have been observed to increase thermostability, and the hypotheses stated above are proposed as a fundamental mechanism to explain this phenomenon. <br/><br/>In the process of testing these hypotheses, several enzymes (alpha-glucosidases and cellulases) in the most common protein fold, the 8 stranded alpha/beta barrels, will be redesigned to function at the high temperatures consistent with the needs of promising industrial processes. Using high throughput, low error rate, random mutagenesis and chromogenic selection, several enzymes which show increased thermostability will be selected. In order to achieve higher catalytic rates and efficiencies, enzymes from psychrophilic, or ""cold-loving,"" organisms will be used as a starting point. From multiple attempts of this process, a structural map of ""hot spots"" in the alpha/beta barrel architecture that show a high probability of involvement in temperature adaptation will be generated. These ""hot spots"" will be compared to those identified from a structural database, developed by this project, of all known alpha/beta barrel structures from mesophilic, thermophilic, and psychrophilic bacteria to posit general, fold specific rules for protein design.<br/><br/>In a complimentary approach, those thermostable mutants that exhibit no obvious structural mechanisms for thermostability in the native-state will be compared using hard-sphere steric ab initio molecular modeling to enumerate all possible sterically-allowed conformations for tetra-peptide sequences in the protein. These will be classified as native-like and non-native and will then be compared to similarly calculated conformational space ratios for the structurally equivalent regions of wild-type enzyme and correlated to their propensity for increasing thermostability. In order to classify which conformations are ruled in or out, and which are native-like and non native, a novel 3D Ramachandran Map-like tool that graphically represents different tetrapeptide conformations will be developed. <br/><br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>In 2009, Forbes ranked Claflin University as the Best Historically Black University in the nation. Over 90% of the student body is African American and 60% are first generation college students, making Claflin a vital part of the regional and national effort to recruit minority students into advanced degrees in STEM fields. By incorporating this research into four different project-based lab courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels, students will learn traditional techniques such as protein purification, PCR, kinetics measurements, and bio computational analysis, and will apply them in semester-long projects. In order to stimulate enthusiasm, the top-performing students (with the largest number of successful mutants or best computational results) will earn one trip to a national research conference to present their results. Thus, this project encourages over 40 African American and first generation students per semester (all biology and biochemistry majors at Claflin) to participate in and learn about cutting edge bio fuel research. The project will introduce the field to a whole generation of students, while at the same time supporting the development of sustainable energy by unlocking a critical step in biofuel production."

In particular, the molecular dynamics method (which uses computers to trace out the atomic motion within such molecules) will be further developed. Computational tools that will emerge during the next period will include more accurate models for the watery solvent around the simulated biological molecules, and more powerful methods for sampling the shapes and energetic properties of the biological molecules. Challenging new applications include exploration of the biophysics of protein kinases and Ras proteins, and new studies of cytochrome P450s and protein-assisted membrane fusion. <br/><br/>The training of young scientists will continue to be a central focus of the project. More than a dozen group members moved on to tenure-track faculty positions in the preceding project period. A similar number of undergraduates participated in research prior to going on to graduate school; many of these students are first authors of journal articles based on their work, and several are from underrepresented groups in science. All of these recruitment activities will continue. Group members will also continue to have the opportunity to teach in regular courses at UCSD and in summer schools offered by the NSF Center for Theoretical Biological Physics. This contributes to the success of the group in training young scientists for academic and research careers, and also represents a valuable outreach activity to the scientific community. Additional societal benefits expected to emerge from the research include practical new methods for the study of molecular recognition, which will be helpful in the design of useful molecules and devices.

689437,"Protein synthesis is one of the most critical cellular activities of any organism. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are essential enzymes in protein biosynthesis, catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to tRNA adaptors for ribosomal decoding of genetic information. Many tRNA synthetases have additional roles in cellular regulation separate from their function in translation. This project investigates mechanistic features of methionyl-tRNA synthetase, which is a distinctive tRNA synthetase in that its tRNA isoacceptors have divergent fates in translational initiation versus elongation. The tRNA synthetases exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms in different organisms, and, in some organisms, they contain appended protein domains that expand their cellular functions. Using tools of molecular biology, computational chemistry, and mechanistic enzymology, this research seeks to expand understanding of evolutionarily distinct methionyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes in protein biosynthesis and novel cellular activities. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The project provides training in modern biological chemistry techniques to emerging scientists at Wake Forest University, a liberal arts university. The local community is impacted through after-school science clubs offering hands-on enrichment activities for at-risk middle school students. These science clubs are led by undergraduate students in a seminar course on the history of women in science, thus providing a real-world example of the challenges inherent in increasing participation of populations typically underrepresented in science."
811455,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Elucidating the mechanisms by which enzymes - proteins that accelerate chemical reactions-- control chemical reactivity is among the most exciting challenges in contemporary life sciences. To comprehend cells' inner workings it is particularly important to understand how enzymes fine tune their ability to bind specifically their reaction partners and accelerate only the desired reaction. This research focuses on the unique chemistry of a family of enzymes that utilizes the rare amino acid selenocysteine. These selenoenzymes are highly efficient and exhibit a unique capacity to escape inactivation by reactive oxygen species, i.e. toxic chemicals that are formed during energy production. The project utilizes biophysical approaches to study these properties and their molecular origins in detail by focusing on commonalities among the selenoenzymes. Thus, the intellectual merit of this research arises from understanding the specialized chemistry performed by selenoenzymes and how it supplements and integrates with the commonly used sulfur-based chemistry of the abundant amino acid cysteine. It will reveal the fundamentals that govern selenoenzymes function and, more generally, enzyme operation and regulation.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The broader impact of this project arises from the creation of a research and educational environment -both in the classroom and in the laboratory- that emphasizes the training of the students' systematic and logical reasoning skills. Furthermore, it seeks to nurture the students' confidence to apply these tools to independently seek and evaluate information. The ideal is to share the pleasures and responsibilities of science. This is achieved by expanding the biochemistry curriculum to incorporate active learning and inquiry-based teaching methods to emphasize learning concepts. The goal is not only to better prepare a wide audience from many disciplines for their prospective careers, but to also enhance their interest in science and its contribution to contemporary life. To diversify and expand participation in science, a unique summer program will provide college students with physical and learning disabilities with specialized career advice, networking opportunities, and examples of career paths of scientists who faced similar adversities. The goal is to prepare and to encourage these college students, who typically leave the sciences, to pursue graduate studies in science and engineering."
650000,"When embryos develop, cells are often born in one location but required at another. Scientists are searching for the molecular mechanisms that govern the critical decision of a cell to move or stay in place. Dr. Starz-Gaiano and others have uncovered a pivotal role for a molecular cascade, called the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway, in determining whether a cell will become motile. This pathway is also essential for some cells to remain as stem cells instead of developing into another kind of cell. Dr. Starz-Gaiano's laboratory will use genetic, molecular, and mathematical approaches to understand how STAT signaling controls these cellular events. Fruit flies will be used in these studies because they have several advantages: rapid development, a small and well-characterized genome, many genetic methods, and transparent tissues that enable visualization of cells as they move. Dr. Starz-Gaiano expects to discover the mechanism by which STAT signaling is turned off in select cells, to identify the critical molecules that STAT employs to change the adhesiveness of cells, and to compare the properties of motile cells to those required for stem cell maintenance. <br/><br/>Unlocking the molecular mysteries of cellular decision-making is essential in understanding normal development, birth defects, and disease progression. Because over 80% of fruit fly genes are also found in humans, the molecular mechanisms identified in this project will likely be broadly applicable. This research will impact the fields of molecular signaling, cell motility, stem cell biology, and mathematical modeling of natural phenomena. The projects are also well-positioned to enhance education through interdisciplinary partnerships and will leverage UMBC's nationally-recognized programs that increase involvement of underrepresented students in science. Thus, the proposed activities will integrate widely relevant, interdisciplinary research with simultaneous, outstanding education for the next generation of citizens and potential scientists."
672426,"Accurate atomistic simulation of large conformational changes of proteins remains one of the greatest challenges in computational biology. Implicit treatment of the solvent environment has recently emerged as the premier alternative to traditional explicit solvent with a desired balance between accuracy and speed. The objective of this CAREER project is to develop, optimize and assess novel implicit treatments of nonpolar solvation to better balance competing electrostatic and nonpolar interactions. The second objective is to combine simulation and experiment to understand the structure, interaction and control of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). IDPs are an important newly recognized class of functional proteins that rely on a lack of stable structures for function. The heterogeneous and dynamic nature of IDPs presents significant challenges for detailed characterization with either experiment or simulation alone. The PI will combine implicit solvent modeling, advanced sampling techniques, and NMR experiment to address these challenges. A novel hypothesis to be tested is that long- range electrostatic interactions can act concertedly with fly-casting to facilitate efficient recognition of IDPs. New and fundamental information will be obtained on the molecular principles of IDP structure and interaction. A practical outcome of this project will be an improved implicit solvent protein force field that can be broadly applied to study protein structure, dynamics and interaction.<br/><br/>The new protein modeling tools will be directly incorporated into training and educational activities including practical course units, training projects involving undergraduate and high school students, and summer workshops for a diverse selection of participants. Specifically, the PI will: 1) develop and revamp undergraduate and graduate courses to increase interdisciplinary awareness at an early stage of education and to provide basic training in biomolecular simulation that is much needed at Kansas State University (KSU); 2) continue to actively contribute to outreach programs at KSU including Women in Engineering and Science Program, Developing Scholar Program and Bridges to the Baccalaureate to increase the participation of women and other minorities in science; 3) initiate annual two-day summer workshops to enhance the knowledge of computational and structural biology for college and high school teachers. Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting teachers from community colleges in southern Kansas that have a large Hispanic student population and traditionally show weakness in student preparation. These workshops will help foster new collaborations in research and education with minority-severing institutions."
843269,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Considerable diversity exists in the mechanisms of ion transport in living systems. This is basic research into one class of ion transport proteins that is widely distributed in the biosphere. Rnf is a widely distributed family of bacterial membrane proteins that is involved in a variety of important physiological processes, including nitrogen fixation, oxygen sensing and anaerobic metabolism. So far, all the members of this family seem to transport sodium ions across the bacterial cell membrane. Some Rnfs behave as redox-driven ion pumps contributing energy to the membrane potential, while others consume the gradient to drive unfavorable redox reactions. Moreover, the actual directionality of coupling between the redox reaction and ion translocation appears to vary in different Rnfs. For a class of enzymes with so many important roles, little is known about the structure or mechanism. The overall goal of this project is to define the physiological roles of the various Rnfs and understand the mechanisms that underpin these functions. Efforts will be focused on the identity of the pumped ion, the directionality of the pumping reaction, the topology of the enzyme and the localization of cofactors with respect to the membrane. This work will provide the basis for future studies on members of this family and will shed light of how similar proteins perform diverse functions. The project will use a combination of biophysical, kinetic and spectroscopic studies using site directed mutants to characterize the individual mechanistic steps in the enzyme reaction. This multidisciplinary approach will give an understanding of the functioning of this family of proteins in the context of the overall bacterial physiology.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>This project will provide a foundation for the understanding of the mechanism of the Rnf family of proteins, a group of proteins widely distributed in bacteria. The combination of biochemistry, biophysical techniques will provide a better understanding of the mechanism of these enzymes, their physiological roles and eventually how bacteria achieve complicated reactions as nitrogen fixation, oxygen sensing and adaptation to different environments.<br/><br/>The PI is actively involved in graduate and undergraduate education and students at all levels participate in research efforts in the PI's laboratory. This project will include a strong commitment in training a graduate student and a postdoctoral trainee in the PI's lab. The multidisciplinary approach of the project will provide an excellent opportunity for the participants of this project to learn basic techniques in Microbiology, Biochemistry, Spectroscopy and Biophysics. The laboratory will host a summer student from the local High School in coordination with the 'Design your Future Day Program' which brings high school girls to visit RPI for a day."
587711,"While it is recognized that the molecular evolution of proteins is integral to the evolution of species, the physical mechanisms underlying protein evolution and the physical properties of proteins that facilitate evolution are not well understood. The objective of this CAREER project is to address these questions through the development and application of new theoretical models that rapidly and accurately capture the essential physics and chemistry relevant to the evolution of enzyme function. The approach will specifically involve modeling the effects of mutations on the stability of a native protein fold as well as the effects of mutation on catalytic efficiency. The application of these and other theoretical tools to informative model systems will form the basis for discovering physical-chemical features associated with molecular evolution. Examples of these features include the physical mechanisms underlying compensatory mutations as well as the role of protein stability and dynamics in facilitating transitions to new enzymatic activities.<br/><br/>This CAREER project represents an integrated and multidisciplinary educational and research approach, focused on using the laws of chemistry and physics to explain and predict fundamental evolutionary processes in biology. The new methods and new physical understanding of molecular evolution resulting from this project will have direct implications for a variety of fields including protein engineering and design, directed evolution, and nanotechnology. In addition to the impact of the research, the educational goals will impact future scientists by training undergraduate and graduate students to approach biological questions from a quantitative perspective. This objective will be partially realized through the development of a new undergraduate course in chemical biology and a new graduate level course in biophysical chemistry. In addition, this project will involve the development of a new interactive software package that will further establish, for students, the value of applying quantitative thinking to biological questions. The software will do this by allowing students to explore the connection between the physical properties of proteins and the biological function of proteins. The developed educational software will have a broad impact as it will be distributed freely to the public and will therefore be available to universities nationally and internationally."
528383,"Intellectual Merits: One of the central issues in the evolutionary field is to understand the impact of duplicate genes on evolution. The proposed research will contribute to this understanding by demonstrating how gene duplication contributes to metabolic innovation and specifically to aerobic fermentation in yeast. The research builds on a kinetic modeling framework to investigate how gene duplication contributed to the evolution of novel metabolic functions. One aspect of the research will explore also the evolutionary connection of gene duplication and novel gene regulatory mechanisms and how these contribute to cellular metabolic innovation. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research will have important broader impacts. It will train students, including graduate, undergraduate and high school students. The PI is involved in multiple activities to include minority students with the hope to encourage and support a diverse next generation of evolutionary scientists. Aerobic fermentation in yeast has broader implication for agricultural and industrial industries. The link between nutrition and evolution itself represents an attractive case study for the edcuation of the public on the subject of evolution."
863615,"The increasing demand for food, feed and biofuel makes it very important to increase crop production, especially under adverse climate conditions. Plant steroid hormones, Brassinosteroids (BRs), have the potential to promote crop yield and improve plant performance against bacterial and fungal diseases and stresses such as drought and high temperature. Understanding BR functions in plants is essential to fully harvest its beneficial effects. Although BR signaling pathway has been well established, how BR regulates thousands of genes for various hormonal responses is not well understood. In this project, the investigators will use genetic, genomic, and computational approaches to establish gene regulatory networks through which BRs control the expression of the large number of genes for plant growth and stress tolerance. While the genetic and genomic studies will define the gene functions, the computational approach is required to build models for how hundreds to thousands of genes coordinate to carry out specific functions. The combination of functional genomic studies and computational modeling in establishing and validating transcriptional networks in hormone signaling is novel and is anticipated to provide unprecedented new insights into BR signaling network. The knowledge can be applied to agriculture to increase crop production. Moreover, the computational and bioinformatic tools developed and validated in the context of this project will be applicable to other systems biology studies. The research will also provide outstanding training opportunities at the interface of functional genomics and computational modeling for graduate and undergraduate students. High school science teachers will be recruited to participate in the research and to integrate such research into high school science education. The BR mutants will be introduced to an undergraduate laboratory course, in which a large number of undergraduate students each year will design and perform experiments to learn how plant steroid hormones control plant growth."
886989,"Intellectual Merit: Cellular calcium mediates diverse processes in both animal and plant cells, including gene expression, cell proliferation, cell division, metabolism, and cell movement. Stomata are microscopic pores each formed by a pair of guard cells that shrink and swell to regulate respiration. Calcium channels in the plasma membrane of these specialized cells play a crucial role in allowing an increase of cytosolic Ca2+, which causes these pores to close thus limiting water loss by the plant. Patterns of cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics encode information that impacts stomatal behavior and controls the specificity and efficiency of gene expression; however, the molecular identity of these Ca2+ channels in plants remains elusive. In addition, molecular mechanisms by which these Ca2+ patterns regulate cellular responses, including gene expression, have yet to be identified. Using Arabidopsis guard cells as a model system, the aim of this project is to investigate how a cellular Ca2+ signal is transduced by molecular components at the single-cell level. In this project, a multidisciplinary approach that includes computational modeling and molecular genetic analysis, will be used to characterize a family of putative Ca2+-permeable channel proteins in the plasma membrane and to analyze how cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics modulates gene expression in guard cells and contributes to the regulation of stomatal behavior. The results of this research will reveal novel molecular components of cellular Ca2+ signaling and provide new insights into Ca2+ dynamics-controlled cellular responses in plants.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Fresh water scarcity is one of the major global problems this century, and 65% of global fresh water is used for agriculture. Plants lose over 95% of their water via transpiration through stomatal pores in the leaf surface. Since cellular calcium plays a key role in the regulation of stomatal behavior, results and knowledge arising from the proposed research will contribute to protecting the environment and to improving agricultural productivity. Two postdoctoral fellows, two graduate students and one or more undergraduate students will participate in this project. The PI and co-PI will provide extensive mentoring to prepare postdoctoral associates for their future careers. The PI and co-PI will continue making a commitment to broadening the participation of students from underrepresented groups. The PI and co-PI will give presentations and lectures to the public to stimulate general interest in science and science education. In collaboration with colleagues, the PI plans to offer an open house to local and state governmental officials to provide a non-technical explanation of our research and give these policymakers an opportunity to see first hand tax dollars at work."
658507,"Intellectual Merit: The ability of an organism to change its phenotype in response to various environmental cues is of fundamental biological importance, but the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood even for the best studied systems. The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis detects currently unidentified starvation cues and processes this information via its gene regulatory networks, resulting in formation of a spore. Using this simple unicellular organism as a model, the long-term goal of this research is to discover general principles underlying the information processing by gene regulatory networks. Specifically, this project will uncover how B. subtilis processes information under conditions of environmental uncertainty and makes appropriate cell-fate decisions at the systems level. The cornerstone of the approach is a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments as well as deterministic (population-average) and stochastic (single-cell) mathematical models. The key to success is the construction of synthetic strains which perturb various processes in the networks and the comparison of their responses to one another and to those in the wild-type strain. The experimental results will be analyzed using integrative mathematical models. The interdisciplinary nature of this research will uncover how signal-response characteristics and cell-fate decisions of the network are affected by its architecture.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>As a model system, B. subtilis offers significant experimental advantages including powerful genetic tools, large collections of mutant strains, and a fully sequenced genome. Unraveling the mechanisms of information processing by the sporulation network is a key step towards understanding the molecular basis of cell-fate decision at the unicellular level. Thus, the innovative approaches in this project may be applicable for addressing similar problems in other organisms and can be used for teaching system-level concepts to students of various levels and backgrounds. In particular, the resulting collection of synthetic strains can be used for educational purposes in the undergraduate laboratory setting because their networks are easy to perturb by varying the inducer levels. As a result, students will gain an understanding of the relationship between network architecture and system level properties. In addition, mathematical models can be used as a cornerstone for systems biology curriculum. The project will also provide abundant interdisciplinary training opportunities for the participating students from various backgrounds working together on experimental and/or mathematical modeling."
764949,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Sulfur-containing cofactors participate in a wide range of essential biological reactions. Although sulfur has long been recognized as indispensable to protein cofactors, its incorporation into biomolecules is not completely understood. In most organisms, the recruitment of sulfur for the synthesis of several cofactors involves the participation of a single general enzyme, cysteine desulfurase. The recruitment of such a promiscuous enzyme therefore poses an experimental challenge for dissecting the specific mechanisms of sulfur mobilization because its inactivation affects the synthesis of most sulfur cofactors. Gram-positive microbes such as Bacillus subtilis, on the other hand, code for several distinct cysteine desulfurases. Based on their genomic location, coding sequences, and preliminary analyses, the lab hypothesizes that each has specialized functions in sulfur metabolism. Using a combination of molecular genetics, biochemical and spectroscopic approaches, the lab will investigate the specific catalytic mechanisms by which these enzymes mobilize sulfur and their participation in the biosynthesis of sulfur cofactors using Bacillus subtilis as the model organism. This project will (i) establish the evolutionary importance of the differentiation and specialization of cysteine desulfurases; (ii) define key aspects of their structural, mechanistic, and functional relationships; and (iii) provide an excellent model system to study sulfur-trafficking reactions uncoupled from iron-sulfur metabolism. Successful results will transform our understanding of life-sustaining reactions and the intersections of metabolic pathways in the synthesis of essential sulfur cofactors.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The broader impacts of this CAREER project will include the involvement of graduate students from Wake Forest University and undergraduate students from neighboring institutions in a mentored research/professional development program. The support team comprised of graduate students and instructors will develop a career plan for the students, which will include summer research experience and participation in professional development activities and meetings during the academic year. This program aims to broaden the scientific research preparation and participation of underrepresented groups in science. The team-mentoring approach will also have an impact on participating graduate students and their training as future teacher-scholars."
994999,"An award has been made to the University of California Merced (UCM) to establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program starting in Spring 2011 and continuing through Fall 2015. This program will provide a two-year research and mentoring program in which four cohorts (5 students for first 2 cohorts and 6 students for last 2 cohorts) will receive a combined classroom and hands-on training in a broad array of computational and mathematical biology methods and tools during the summer portions of the program, and then join research projects with faculty mentors in the UC Merced Biological Sciences, Applied Mathematics, and Computer Science programs. The goal of the UCM-URM program is to directly prepare a more diverse population of undergraduate students with the skills needed to pursue and complete graduate studies, and ultimately pursue careers in computational biology and related fields. UCM-URM students will study computational and mathematical biology and develop high-quality research skills that apply critical thinking beyond what is typically achieved in an undergraduate classroom. By the end of their term in the program, students will be well positioned for admission into highly competitive graduate programs in computational biology and related fields. The UCM-URM program will include three main components: (1) a summer training program; (2) two years of independent research, mentored directly by faculty, and culminating in a research portfolio; and (3) ongoing enhancement activities to foster cohort-building and networking, peer mentoring, written and oral communication skills building, ethics training, and career development. Recruitment efforts for the program will be particularly targeted towards groups that have been underrepresented in these fields. Selection into the program and matching with a research mentor will be made according to specific criteria to assure student success. Success of this program will have a significant positive impact on the recruitment of talented undergraduates from diverse populations in California's Central Valley, which has been traditionally underserved by higher education, into biology majors and ultimately into biology related careers. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies will be used to measure student progress during the two stages of the proposed program, with oversight and advice from an external Advisory Committee.

530669,"An award was made to the University of Virginia to provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, for the summers of 2010-2014. The REU Site program at Mountain Lake Biological Station is a summer opportunity to conduct guided, but independent, self-motivated original biological research in field-based ecology, evolution, and behavior. Under the supervision of a resident research mentor and the program Coordinator, students design, execute, analyze, interpret, and present an original research project. Students live and work full-time on the station. They participate in weekly seminars on the design and conduct of research, scientific ethics, writing and presentation techniques, and other matters of scientific and academic life. Training in professional behavior, scientific ethics, and the careful, unbiased, and responsible conduct of research is core to the program. Students prepare written and oral proposals and final reports. Participants also take advantage of the rich, varied, and stimulating intellectual life at Mountain Lake Biological Station. All Station residents eat meals together in the common dining hall, and most daily activity revolves around the central lab building where all research programs are housed. Interactions among all Station users occur constantly, resulting in a remarkably supportive and collaborative environment. The Station has hosted a NSF REU Sites program since 1993 and has graduated over 200 students. Program success is quantified with anonymous exit surveys and by tracking publication rate and graduate program matriculation. A substantial proportion of REU projects are published, and a large number of participants go on to graduate school. The program has been successful in attracting students from small colleges, women, and members of groups underrepresented in science. The program maintains formal partnerships with regional HBCUs, the University of Puerto Rico, and the ESA SEEDS program.

524502,"Stomata are tiny pores on the surfaces of plant leaves that allow the exchange of gases between the plant and the atmosphere. Plants control the apertures of these pores in response to environmental factors so that they can maximize uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (for sugar production in photosynthesis) while minimizing water loss to the atmosphere. Because the exchange of these gases is critically important to plant productivity and water use in natural and agricultural systems, it is important to understand the processes that control stomatal apertures. This project will explore the mechanisms by which stomata respond to light, carbon dioxide, temperature, and atmospheric humidity. In particular, the project will test several novel hypotheses that provide simple explanations for a complex suite of responses to these environmental factors that are not well explained by previously proposed mechanisms. In addition, the idea that interactions among individual stomata may function as a type of primitive information processing will be explored. Much of the work in the proposal is highly interdisciplinary, and students will benefit from the combined expertise of the two Principal Investigators: a biologist and physicist. The PIs will also collaborate to teach a new, interdisciplinary, undergraduate course entitled 'Dynamics, Information, and Multicellularity', which will cover information processing and emergent behavior in artificial and natural systems and the role of information processing in the development of multicellular organisms. The improved mechanistic understanding of stomatal responses to the environment that will result from this project will aid in producing more water-efficient crops, and in addition, because water loss through stomata is important for global circulation models, it will provide better predictive models for weather and the effects of global climate change."
654703,"Individuals vary in their response to natural enemies and this variation has an important effect on the relationship between consumers and resources. Animals and plants can tolerate or resist the attacks of their enemies and enemies must shape their attack strategies to optimize survival and reproduction. A challenge in the ecology of species interactions is to identify the factors responsible for this individual variation. At the heart of host-parasite interactions lie the immunological processes that allow the host to respond to an infection and the life history strategies that allow parasites to escape host immune defenses and to maximize survival and transmission. This interdisciplinary project integrates recent progress in the immunology of tolerance and resistance with the theory of food web dynamics to examine how the contrasting responses of tolerance and resistance influence parasite development and fecundity within hosts and how these responses affect transmission and long term persistence at host population level. The investigators aim to develop one of the first population-level studies of tolerance-resistance as defined at the molecular level. This will be achieved by a combination of detailed laboratory studies, field monitoring and mathematical modeling. <br/><br/>By identifying the molecular bases for species interactions, this project will provide novel insights into host-parasite interactions and will enhance understanding of community structure, food web dynamics and biodiversity. Parasites represent serious health and economic threats for animals and humans and an appreciation of the fundamental processes of host-parasite interaction will accelerate development of alternative measures for parasite control. Finally, this highly interdisciplinary study offers numerous opportunities to train graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers in multidisciplinary, quantitative approaches and analyses."
532390,"This project will investigate features of neural system organization that can be linked to altered social behavior, including reduced or increased aggression. Two species of canids, experimentally domesticated silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), have been selectively bred by humans for altered social behavior. These behavioral changes occurred alongside a restricted set of genetic changes, creating an unparalleled opportunity to link the evolution of behavioral characteristics (phenotypes) to neural phenotypes. Recent technological advancements enable detailed, non-invasive studies of brain anatomy at relatively low cost. This project will take advantage of these innovations to create high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) brain maps using structural magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and digitized histology. Expected products of this research include: (1) identification of features of neural organization that are linked to reduced or increased sociality or aggression, expected to be generalizable to other species, (2) the production of online fox and dog brain atlases that will be publicly available as a research tool for the general scientific community, (3) training opportunities for young scientists, and (4) outreach efforts using blog and social media posts for the general public. Because dogs are a ""common denominator"" across various cultures, this research has a unique opportunity to be personally relevant and compelling to people from all walks of society, and to enhance public appreciation for science.<br/><br/>Both experimentally-domesticated foxes and domestic dogs are distinguished from their wild forebears by altered social approach-avoidance behavior. Previous research in rodents and primates, and the researchers' own preliminary data, allow for the formation of well-grounded hypotheses about neural adaptations that result from selection pressure on social approach-avoidance behavior. Specifically, this project will investigate limbic and fronto-limbic systems governing social behavior and response selection. In order to identify features of neural system organization associated with altered social behavior, whole-brain white and gray matter organization will be compared (a) between various breeds of domestic dogs, each tested for social approach-avoidance/aggression behavior, and (b) between strains of foxes bred for social avoidance behavior, which react aggressively to social contact, versus foxes bred for social approach behavior, which are tame and friendly like dogs, versus wild type foxes. Whole-brain MRI and DTI images will be collected using 3.0 and 9.4 Tesla MRI scanners. Histology images will be digitally scanned and aligned to MRI images. Analyses will include voxel-based morphometry, tract-based spatial statistics, probabilistic tractography, and k-means connectivity-based parcellation. The research will advance knowledge about how evolution modified brain organization in response to selection for social approach and avoidance."
509321,"Many of Earth's ecological systems face substantial future warming that could cause loss of species, erode ecological functioning, and jeopardize environmental services that support human livelihoods. Ecological theory predicts that some species may be resilient to warming if individuals in warmer parts of their distribution have already evolved greater tolerance of high temperature and can migrate to cooler parts as they warm. Less clear is whether these immigrants will be able to play the same functional roles as the former residents; if not, ecological functions could still erode. To test this question, this study will study populations of spider predators and insect prey across a temperature gradient similar to the predicted change in global climate. The thermal tolerances of spiders from north to south will be measured, spiders and prey populations will be experimentally transplanted between parts of the regions to mimic the mixing that might occur due to warming and migration, and the differences in functioning between these experimentally mixed communities and existing communities will be tested. The study will thus improve understanding of the potential for evolution to confer the ability to tolerate changes in climate and thereby increase the resiliency of species to environmental change. <br/><br/>This project will enhance participation of women and minorities in STEM research in the context of environmental problems. It will also help to train a globally diverse and competitive STEM workforce through coursework and hands-on research experiences in evidence-based, applied environmental science. The research infrastructure will be leveraged to develop New Haven Public School STEM curricula on environmental services, biodiversity, and effects of climate change."
657499,"Climate change, invasive species and other important factors impacting ecological systems operate at continental to global scales. At these scales, conducting experiments can be difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, ecologists increasingly rely on analyses of large scale observational data to predict how these systems will respond to increasing changes in climate and habitat. Progress in this area of research has been slowed by the large number of patterns used to characterize ecological structure, and by the fact that most research focuses on a single group of species thus limiting the generality of the results. This project will increase the speed at which knowledge of ecological systems is acquired by characterizing the relationships among ecological patterns and focusing research on the small number of key patterns that need to be studied to understand the behavior of ecological systems. This will be accomplished using advanced methods from physics that characterize the most likely form of an ecological pattern given a small number of constraints on the system. This research will test the performance of this approach using data on wide variety of species. This method will then be combined with established ecological models to predict a suite of major ecological patterns using only a small number of environmental variables.<br/><br/>This project will improve how ecologists test and establish the generality of theories by educating ecologists in advanced computational methods through online and university courses, by providing web-based resources on the collections of data that are available and how to utilize them, and by automating complicated database tasks using computer programs that download, configure, and install optimized versions of ecological databases, thus allowing the rapid incorporation of available data into research projects. This combined research and education program has the potential to substantially improve the rate at which the field of ecology advances by focusing the research effort on a smaller number of patterns and processes, and by allowing ecologists to rapidly determine if a given pattern or hypothesis is general and if not how it varies among ecological systems."
587294,"Cellulose microfibrils provide strength to plant cell walls, as well as to the numerous commercial products made from wood and other plant fibers. Whereas cellulose provides desirable strength and durability in many applications, the biofuel industry would benefit from a supply of cellulose that is more susceptible to enzymatic or chemical breakdown. The structure and physical properties of cellulose microfibrils arise through the biosynthetic process and thus can potentially be modified. Cellulose is synthesized by membrane complexes (CSCs) that, in seed plants, consist of 24-36 cellulose synthase subunits of three different types arranged in a rosette shape. Comparative studies of algae and plants have demonstrated a relationship between CSC shape and cellulose microfibril structure. However, the factors that determine CSC shape are unknown. The CSCs of the model moss species, Physcomitrella patens, have a rosette shape like those of vascular plants, but they differ from seed plant CSCs in subunit composition. The investigators will use biochemical, genetic and molecular approaches to determine the subunit composition of the Physcomitrella patens CSCs and test specific hypotheses pertaining to their evolutionary origin. By clarifying the evolutionary history of cellulose synthase, the results of this investigation will guide efforts to determine the contributions of each of the distinct cellulose synthase types to the assembly and function of seed plant CSCs. The broader impacts of this project include training of graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups; development of learning modules for middle and high school students focusing on analysis and interpretation of data generated by graduate and undergraduate students; and generation of fundamental knowledge about the mechanism of cellulose biosynthesis that may contribute to efforts to genetically manipulate cellulose biosynthesis in commercial plants."
765085,"Natural ecosystems experience constant change, and the consequences of this change are often revealed gradually over long periods of time. Twenty-five active Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) projects collect the long-term data necessary to identify these consequences and their effects on the ecosystem services, such as provision of clean water, that are critical for society. The LTER Network Office provides information management, communication, and logistic services to advance LTER research. This project will continue these services for one year while a new National Office is selected and becomes operational. The project will advance the field of ecosystem ecology by organizing multidisciplinary meetings and by providing the information management services needed to ensure public access to LTER data. Activities over the coming year will increase the amount and diversity of ecological data available to the scientific community, policy makers, resource managers, and the public, and will facilitate understanding of the nature and pace of ecological change.<br/><br/>The researchers will organize people, tools, and ideas to promote understanding of ecological systems from local to global scales. The Science Council meeting will initiate network-level syntheses leading to scientific publications and presentations, lay the groundwork for broad community-wide participation in a triennial All Scientists Meeting, and address issues critical to the long-term stability and success of the LTER Network. Outcomes from the All Scientists Meeting will include the formation of new collaborations with programs outside of the LTER community, the development of new LTER science themes, and better integration of graduate students and early-career scientists into the LTER community. Continued support of the LTER Network Information System will increase the amount and diversity of ecological data available to the scientific community and observation networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) for comparison and synthesis. The researchers will provide leadership in the important areas of data sharing, data standards, connectivity, and the acquisition and implementation of new technologies through relationships with other distributed networks and research programs."
541002,"Fossils provide our only direct evidence of past biodiversity and how individual organisms to ecosystems have responded to past and long-term environmental change. This project fills a major gap in the documentation of past environmental change, making available digitized data from the especially rich fossil record of the eastern Pacific marine invertebrate communities of the Cenozoic, the 66 million years that have passed since the extinction of the dinosaurs. Digitization and integration of these data will foster increased accessibility, efficient analysis to understand past change, the identification of factors involved in that change, and enable predictions for how current biodiversity may be impacted by future change. Development of virtual fieldwork experiences will assist stakeholders and educators in understanding how field data and fossil collections are used to infer past ecosystem and environmental conditions.<br/><br/>The data currently exist as a vast collection of fossil specimens and printed materials distributed among multiple natural history collections: this project involves 7 primary institutions, one small collection and one federal institution and will integrate this digitized specimen data with the other two ongoing fossil networks through the web portal iDigPaleo, expanding the resource for fossil invertebrate information by spanning over 500 million years. This wealth of data will provide resources not only to researchers, but will be made available to K-16 educators, government, industry, and the general public. Through the national resource (iDigBio) these data will be integrated with information on modern organisms providing the means to understand important questions on niches, environmental change, transitions in sea levels, etc. Additionally, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the modern uses of natural history collections.

501781,"This project will improve our understanding of the evolution of infectious disease systems while also contributing to education and the development of conservation strategies for protecting amphibian diversity. Disease epidemics rarely end in the complete extinction of host populations. Especially in highly lethal diseases, theory predicts a shift away from the outbreak phase to a post-outbreak stage where hosts and pathogens persist in a shared environment. Such transitions in disease states present a moving target that limits the development of successful intervention strategies. This research investigates the factors that drive evolutionary shifts in disease dynamics by focusing on one of the most devastating infectious diseases of vertebrates in recorded history, amphibian chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is caused by a fungal pathogen that can spread rapidly through amphibian populations and cause extremely high levels of mortality, suggesting that it is a strong agent of natural selection. This disease has caused - and continues to cause - dramatic losses of amphibian biodiversity around the world. The investigators are using an in-depth understanding of chytridiomycosis to develop science-based conservation strategies. The research is integrated with educational outreach, including public workshops and presentations centered on the annual International Save the Frogs Day. <br/><br/>This research capitalizes on a decade of research in Central America and on an unprecedented archive of disease data, pathogen isolates, and host samples. Pathogen isolates and host samples were collected and archived during the outbreak phase of the disease and similar data are being collected during the endemic phase, beginning eight to ten years later. The researchers are using experimental and molecular methods to investigate the hypotheses that (1) the level of pathogen virulence has shifted since the original outbreaks and (2) that hosts have evolved to be more tolerant of infection. To test these hypotheses, the investigators are testing the historic and contemporary samples to identify phenotypic and genetic differences linked to pathogen virulence host immune defenses. The results will provide insights for safeguarding amphibian biodiversity and for understanding the role of evolution in shaping post-epidemic dynamics of emerging infectious diseases."
781203,"This work will explore two fundamental questions about multicellularity. First, are the early stages of development necessarily the hardest to change? This seems true in animals, but the project will test whether this pattern is general, using genomic data in a very different multicellular system, a social amoeba in which is normally a single-celled eukaryote, but upon starvation aggregates and differentiates into a structure with reproductive spores and sterile stalk cells. The second question is, how do multicellular organisms protect themselves from mutant cell lineages that replicate too fast? The project will use the novel strategy of constructing pseudo-organisms with artificial life cycles. By allowing these to evolve and monitoring cellular cooperation, the project will isolate factors that maintain multicellularity.<br/><br/><br/>The most advanced organisms on earth, including people, animals, and plants, are all multicellular. Yet there is much that we do not understand about how and why multicellularity works. By focusing an unusual developmental system, the project will test how events at one time or place in development affect and constrain events at other times and places. They will also conduct the first rigorous tests of what life cycles protect against conflict among cells - cancer being a prominent example. The project will contribute to scientific training and will reach out to the public via websites, science cafes, and events for K-12 students."
558800,"Marine plants and animals live in an environment where chemical signals are often more important than visual signals. Waterborne chemicals provide marine organisms with critical information about the quality of their environment and the location of food, predators, and mates. However, when the tide is out, intertidal plants and animals spend large amounts of time exposed to air, where waterborne chemical signals are unavailable but airborne chemical signals may be important. Preliminary data has shown that when they are being consumed by grazers, some intertidal plants release dimethyl sulfide, an airborne chemical that can cause nearby plants to produce additional defenses against grazers. This use of airborne signaling chemicals by marine plants is a new and potentially important mechanism of communication among marine intertidal organisms. Because dimethyl sulfide can be detected by animals, it may serve as a signal to other grazers and to their predators about the presence of food or enemies. Thus, the release of dimethyl sulfide has the potential to affect interactions throughout marine food webs. This project will use biochemical methods to measure the release of dimethyl sulfide by marine plants under a variety of environmental conditions and its subsequent movement throughout the environment. A variety of behavioral, physiological, and ecological assays will then be used to determine the effects of airborne dimethyl sulfide on defensive responses and growth rates of nearby plants as well as the responses and feeding rates of herbivores and predators. The results of this study will provide fundamental information about how marine food webs function. Because dimethyl sulfide is important in the global cycling of sulfur, this study will also contribute to knowledge of sulfur movement from the oceans to the atmosphere. At least eight undergraduate students will help conduct this work; therefore, the project will contribute to the training of the next generation of marine scientists."
750000,"This project will build a ""Scientific Observations Network""--as a multi-disciplinary, community-driven effort to define and develop a unified model for observational data, to enhance data sharing, merging and reuse in the earth and life sciences. This effort will coordinate work of a community of experts drawn from numerous disciplines, including ecology, hydrology, oceanography, geo-sciences, the geospatial community, and life sciences, working closely with computer scientists and information managers, to develop necessary specifications and technologies to facilitate intelligent interpretation and seamless integration of observational data. Advances in environmental science and ecology increasingly depend on information from multiple disciplines to address broad, complex questions about the natural world. Researchers are extremely challenged, however, in effectively locating, interpreting, and integrating data that might be relevant for these investigations. This is due to extreme variability in the structure and contents of the data that scientists collect. This project will support the growing interest in the earth and life sciences in the possibilities of describing data at the level of observation and measurement, rather than the traditional focus at the level of the data set, in order to achieve stronger data discovery and interoperability. <br/><br/>The Scientific Observations Network will work to develop compatible, open-source, standards-based approaches to the semantic modeling of observational data. A key goal will be the development of a core conceptual data model for representing scientific observations. This core observations model will provide a common basis for developing, extending, and applying highly specialized scientific terminologies required for detailed descriptions of data relevant for environmental research. Subgroups of experts will engage in extending the core data model to include a broad range of specific measurements collected by the representative disciplines, and a series of demonstration projects will illustrate the capabilities of these approaches to confederate data for reuse in broader and unanticipated contexts. The scientific Observations Network will help to insure that scientific data, once collected, is put to the greatest possible use by the broadest group of users."
580000,"The immune system is exquisitely capable of distinguishing self-tissues from foreign invaders, often with the goals of protecting the former and destroying the latter. This creates a problem for those animals that birth live young following a prolonged pregnancy. How the immune system avoids attacking the embryo that is genetically half foreign has been a central question in immunology for almost 60 years. Using state-of-the-art, high-throughput gene sequencing technology to investigate patterns of gene expression, this project will investigate regulation of the immune system in the pregnant uterus at different time-points during gestation. The model species to be used is the gray short-tailed opossum, a marsupial mammal native to South America. As a marsupial, they are a very distant relative to humans and mice, but still have live birth following a short gestation. Genes identified from sequencing that are candidates for immune regulation will be further investigated by localizing their expression to specific cell types in pregnant tissues. By comparing species such as humans and mice to distant relatives such as opossums, mechanisms that are ancient and conserved, and therefore likely important, will be uncovered. This project will provide a greater understanding of how the immune system is regulated to deal with pregnancy and has potential broader impact on reproductive health. This project also provides outreach to faculty and students at Central New Mexico (CNM) community college. A CNM faculty member and two students will spend each summer in the principal investigator's laboratory working on some aspects of the project. Students for this research opportunity will be chosen with the advice from CNM faculty members. Preference will be given to students who are in the process of transferring to the four-year university setting to give them the opportunity to engage in independent projects with research active faculty."
882414,"The circadian clock is a self-sustained biological oscillator that enables organisms to both anticipate environmental changes and to coordinate different aspects of their physiology. In plants, the circadian clock is necessary for optimal growth and survival and regulates a wide range of physiological processes such as flowering and photosynthesis. The long-term goal of Dr. Farre's laboratory is to understand the design principles of circadian clocks as well as the role of the clock in plant growth and development. In particular, this project will help elucidate the molecular role of the morning expressed pseudo-response regulators PRR7 and PRR9 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using molecular and biochemical approaches. These studies will define not only the molecular function of the PRRs in the circadian oscillator but also the direct role of clock components in the control of physiological responses in plants. Due to the architectural similarities between circadian networks in different organisms, this work will complement the analyses in other systems and advance our understanding of circadian clocks and their mechanisms to impact a large number of processes ranging from biomass production to human circadian disorders. Dr. Farre will also establish a two-year program at Michigan State University for students aimed at becoming secondary biology teachers to gain experience in scientific inquiry in a laboratory setting and to teach laboratory courses. Students will do a research internship in the Farre laboratory where they will work on their own research project associated with this award as well as establish a teaching unit that can be used in a high school class. Students will also be able to practice their teaching skills as teaching assistants of an undergraduate laboratory course."
557600,"When species compete, they often evolve to become more different in morphological and behavioral features that are important in acquiring vital resources, such as food. This process by which species become more different from a competitor is called ""character displacement"". Character displacement is critical for explaining how different species can coexist in the same habitat and why even closely related species typically differ. Yet, we know remarkably little about how this process unfolds. The proposed research will fill this critical gap by conducting observations and experiments on natural populations of two species of frogs. This research could prove vital for understanding how living things develop, function, and change over time. Moreover, this work will help us to understand how an organism's environment, not just its genes, affects its development. <br/><br/>Such studies are essential for evaluating the origin and treatment of developmental diseases. This work will also contribute to educational outreach by training young scientists (including K-12 students) in interdisciplinary research, and will broaden access to science by actively recruiting students from underrepresented groups. Finally, because of numerous changes to their environment, many species are currently undergoing radical shifts in their geographical ranges and thereby encountering new competitors. This work could serve as a model for what might happen to biodiversity following such encounters."
549050,"In several major groups of vertebrates, environmental temperatures experienced during embryonic development determine offspring gender. Temperature-dependent gender determination will be addressed with a multi-year field study of a wild population of the painted turtle, Chrysemys picta. The project will investigate several aspects of this unusual phenomenon: (1) the impact of long-term climatic variation on population structure, particularly the ratio of males to females, (2) the effect of lifetime patterns of nesting behavior on offspring gender ratio, and (3) climatic effects on variation in predator numbers and differential predation on nests, and hence shifts in population gender ratio. A team of student researchers will record nesting date and vegetation cover over nests, follow females across years to evaluate nesting behavior, monitor nests to investigate the influence of predators on offspring recruitment, and relate these data to information on climate and human habitat use.<br/><br/>The findings of this research will have important implications for the impacts of climate change and human habitat use on the biology and conservation of species with this gender determination system. This long-term research program will also continue to provide extensive first-hand and on-line educational opportunities for numerous students, including many underrepresented minorities and women, and the public."
601353,"All cells require energy. This fact is somewhat taken for granted in biodiversity studies of plants and animals, but is at the forefront of discovering novel microbial biodiversity. As an electrical charge flows through energy transfer molecules in a cell, it is coupled to the production of ATP molecules (akin to charging the battery that powers the cell) or the production of other compounds that are critical for life function. Until recently, it was thought that all cells require electron energy transfer molecules that are soluble in water, so that they can be brought into the cell. However, scientists discovered that some bacteria are able to use solid metals such as rust (iron oxides) located outside the cell as an energy source. They do so by shuttling electrons from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell, via energy transfer molecules that deliver electrical charge to metal deposits in the environment. In other words, part of these microbes' energy production pathways have evolved to be outside of the cell. This process, termed extracellular electron transfer (EET), transformed how we think about cellular life and in particular how microbes may impact the global elemental cycles that sustain life on Earth. This research team will conduct the first wide-ranging assessment of the diversity of EET across all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya). The project will also broaden public understanding about microbial life through developing interactive museum exhibits that present microbial EET to the public. Project investigators will work with the Encyclopedia of Life to broaden the representation of microbes in their databases and in school curricula. The project is also uniquely poised to strengthen industry and academic pipelines through educational curriculum that engages middle school students in interdisciplinary EET research, and a pedagogical training and lab exchange program that affords students and postdoctoral scholars an opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>Consistent with the objectives of the DIMENSIONS program, this proposal aims to establish the degree to which ribotypes and genotypes relate to function and activity. This is also a grand challenge in environmental microbiology, and our ability to use bioelectrochemical systems to selectively target electroactive communities affords a unique opportunity to selectively isolate and characterize microbes capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET). To these ends, the overarching goal of this proposal is to comprehensively assess and relate the phylogenetic diversity, genetic/genomic diversity, and functional diversity of microorganisms engaged in EET across all three domains of life. The work plan includes: 1) conducting the first broad, systematic assessment of the phylogenetic diversity of EET-enabled microbes in natural habitats; 2) using the results of these data to identify 20 ""representative"" communities for co-registered metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and biogeochemical characterization to target differentially expressed transcripts associated with EET and the biogeochemical processes that are mediated by these communities; 3) characterizing the genetic, biochemical and biophysical attributes of cultivated but uncharacterized microbes commonly found on electroactive surfaces; 4) integrating these results to develop a better capacity to predict the physiologies and biogeochemical impacts of electroactive communities in nature; and 5) archiving these data in robust databases to allow others to relate the project's findings to their data. These efforts will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset linking phylogenetic data (16S, 18S) with functional potential (genomics), physiological poise (transcriptomics) and metabolic activity (geochemical measurements) that will have many applications to beyond biodiversity science. For example, the combined 'omics and rate measurements will allow the investigators to constrain the extent to which EET contributes to biogeochemical cycles in nature. The transposon mutagenesis and biophysical studies, in turn, will help researchers understand the means by which common but poorly characterized microbes carry out EET. While the value of each of the proposed efforts is significant, the coordination of these activities enables true integration of these findings to provide a comprehensive perspective on the relationships among phylogenetic, genomic and physiological diversity."
709181,"Some plant species are able to thrive across a wide range of climates, and the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Characterizing the genetic and physiological basis of local climatic adaptation is especially critical for assessing whether and how plant species, including crops, can persist through periods of environmental change. Using the widely-adapted species white clover, this project examines the factors that allow this plant to thrive in climates as dramatically different as northern Minnesota and central Florida. The production of cyanide-containing compounds appears to play a role in this process, particularly for adaptation to heat and drought. These compounds are also found in several important crop species, and their importance for drought adaptation will be examined in detail for the first time. Other aspects of natural genetic and physiological variation in climate tolerance will be assessed through field experiments. The project will provide classroom materials and curricular activities for an ongoing and highly successful inquiry-based educational outreach program developed by the principle investigator, which has already engaged more than 8000 students and 100 teachers nationwide. Students sample and analyze their local clover populations and contribute data to an online database, where they can compare observations with classes from other climates. Scientific training will be provided to undergraduates, including those from minority backgrounds, as well as two graduate students and two postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>Adaptation to local environments plays a key role in the ability of plant species to survive and persist through environmental change, yet the genetic and physiological mechanisms that underlie this process are largely unknown. Through work that integrates QTL mapping of fitness traits, candidate gene analyses of two well-characterized biochemical polymorphisms, and physiological assessments of their fitness impacts, the following questions are addressed, using white clover (Trifolium repens) as a study system: 1) What is the genetic architecture of local climatic adaptation? Specifically, to what extent does it arise through fitness tradeoffs for alternate alleles of individual genes (antagonistic pleiotropy), or through combinations of loci where individual genes provide a fitness benefit in one environment and are selectively neutral in others (conditional neutrality)? 2) What are the physiological mechanisms by which cyanogenic glycosides function in abiotic stress adaptation? 3) What is the role of gene copy number variation (CNVs) in local adaptation? This work will rigorously test the function of cyanogenic glycosides, which are found in >3,000 plant species including many crops, in abiotic stress adaptation. CNVs are abundant in the genomes of many taxa, and the project will directly assess their role in local climatic adaptation, which has not previously been done. The project will also engage high school students and teachers nationwide in hands-on, inquiry-based learning through an ongoing and highly successful outreach program based on clover cyanogenesis, and it will provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates."
985643,"Remarkably little is known about the number and types of genetic mutations that control differences within and among species. This project takes advantage of the diversity among the 350+ breeds of domestic pigeon - many of which show spectacular diversity in color, feather, and skeletal traits - to identify the genes that control variation in this species. Experimental crosses between dissimilar pigeon breeds will be used to determine the number and chromosome location of genes controlling interesting traits. Additionally, the genomes of many different breeds will be surveyed to find the specific mutations that control variation. Importantly, many of the traits that vary among pigeon breeds also vary among wild species of birds and other animals; thus, new insights gleaned from pigeons will yield a better general understanding of animal diversity.<br/><br/>The pigeon is already an important model organism in biology and medicine, and this project will potentially expand other research programs by providing new tools for genetic analyses. The educational plan of this project will also have local, national, and global impacts. A centerpiece of this plan is a new computer-based virtual pigeon breeder game that will be installed on the Utah Genetic Science Learning Center's highly successful website. These and other new educational materials will be targeted at a diverse community and broad age range, promote critical thinking and self-directed learning, and key components of this plan will be accessible via the Internet to reach millions of people worldwide."
713050,"The principles underlying the process of adaptive evolution are well established, and have been well tested in the laboratory and over short time periods in the field. However, we also know that the long-term rate of adaptation can be subject to additional processes. The primary objective of this research is to examine how a population's genetic variability affects the rate of adaptation over many generations, in the face of variation in environmental conditions and the depletion of that genetic variation by natural selection. Quantitative genetic experiments will be conducted in nature to assess potential and realized adaptation for three populations of the annual plant species, Chamaecrista fasciculata (partridge pea).<br/><br/>This research will establish an empirical basis for predicting rates of ongoing adaptation. Beyond their fundamental importance, rates of adaptation are now of urgent societal importance in the context of rapidly changing climate. This research will inform policy and efforts directed toward conservation of natural populations. Moreover, the project will contribute to development of scientific capability by involving undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral scholars, including members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields."
934569,"Classic debates on the formation of new species center on the relative significance of geographic isolation and adaption to different environments. New tools in genomics allow a closer look into how these features influence population differentiation. By analyzing how patterns of genomic variation among populations are affected by local ecology, behavior and extent of geographic isolation, important insights about how biodiversity forms can be achieved. Barn swallows are comprised of six closely related sub-species worldwide, where populations vary in: (1) geographic distance from one another, (2) different combinations of mate-selection traits, (3) climates they encounter, and (4) their extent of migratory behaviors, and thus provide powerful opportunities to explore the relative significance of these factors in population divergence. Fifty-five sampling sites across the entire breeding distribution of barn swallows have been established to conduct nearly 1,500 pair-wise population comparisons of genomic and phenotypic divergence. <br/><br/>This investigation will be among the most comprehensive analyses of the relative significance of migratory behavior, climate variability, mate selection, and geographic distance on population genomic divergence, with important insights about how these factors affect the evolution of new species. Here, the scientific goals can be achieved through intermeshing the research with international collaboration, integrative training in Biology and outreach. Two Science Education Fellows will be used to help implement and assess innovation to two courses taught by the PI. Public engagement in this research will be achieved via a newly established Citizen Science program and an exhibition on avian diversity."
640000,"Intellectual Merit. This project concerns mechanisms by which plant hosts recognize viral pathogens and initiate specific defenses. The research is focused on a family of DNA-containing plant viruses known as geminiviruses. In plants, RNA silencing is an important antiviral defense that results in specific degradation of viral mRNA. In the case of DNA viruses, a related process (RNA-directed methylation) leads to the methylation of viral DNA and associated histone proteins that together constitute the viral chromosome. Methylation typically leads to gene silencing, and recent work from this laboratory has demonstrated that cellular pathways used to methylate endogenous cellular genes and viral DNA are essentially identical. In this project, geminiviruses will be employed as models to further study the RNA-directed methylation pathway. Specifically, the roles of cellular RNA polymerases II, IV, and V in de novo methylation of viral genomes will be examined using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. The DNA sequence features that recruit these enzymes to the viral chromosome, the methylation status of the sequences that they recognize, and the nature of the non-coding RNAs that they generate will be investigated. In addition, the geminivirus system will be used to identify and characterize cellular proteins that recognize methylation marks on chromatin and translate these into changes in gene expression. Methylation controls cellular gene expression during normal development, and is important for organizing inactive regions of cellular chromosomes and silencing potentially damaging invasive DNAs. Thus studying geminivirus chromatin methylation promises to increase our understanding of viral pathogenesis and of fundamental processes that govern the activity of cellular chromatin.<br/>Broader Impacts. A better understanding of host antiviral defenses will eventually lead to the development of plants that are better able to withstand or resist virus attack. This project will integrate research and education by contributing to the training of visiting scientists, postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students, some of whom are underrepresented minorities. In addition, the PI participates in the NSF REU Program sponsored by the Department of Molecular Genetics at Ohio State University, and in the OSU Summer Practical Workshop in Plant Functional Genomics, which attracts international and domestic students, postdocs, young faculty, and high school teachers and trains them in basic techniques and principles of molecular biology and genomics. The PI has also contributed materially by donating antibodies to a new, soon-to-be-launched Plant Antibody Facility. As Director of the campus-wide interdisciplinary graduate program in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB, currently ~130 PhD students) for the past 16 years, the PI has a long history of promoting graduate education. Efforts include an active role in recruiting minority students through the Graduate School's SROP Program and the University Office of Diversity and Inclusion. The PI also has an active interest in enabling interactions between faculty and students and annually co-organizes the MCDB Seminar Series, the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program Symposium, and the First-Year Graduate Student Seminar, which includes training in research ethics."
598918,"Although individual animals have long been considered a fundamental unit of evolution, we now know that each is really a co-dependent collection of host animal and microbes. This co-dependency reaches from ancient times through to the present day. Many animals depend on gut bacteria to process food and incorporate essential nutrients into the host's own tissues. To untangle the importance of this partnership for hosts and symbiotic gut bacteria, this project will study a diverse and ecologically important social animal group, the turtle ants. As social organisms, ants and humans share ways for acquiring helpful and harmful bacteria. State-of-the-art molecular and genomic methods will be used to investigate ancient and modern influences on the symbiosis, the function of the bacteria for host health, and the means of passage and maintenance of the bacterial symbionts over millions of years.<br/><br/>Explaining global patterns of biodiversity and their drivers have long been central challenges in the fields of ecology and evolution. Increasingly, it is becoming apparent that biodiversity is itself a function of interactions across different levels of biological organization. Among the metazoans, symbioses with microbes are a defining feature, and individuals are integrated collections of host and symbiont cells, together defining the ""holobiont"". By studying the diverse and tractable turtle ant system, this research will address the relationships between symbiosis and the dimensions of holobiont biodiversity with unprecedented clarity. Specifically, this research will address: 1) the roles of time, biogeography, and habitat in host diversification (host taxonomic dimension); 2) variation in gut communities across host ant phylogeny, geography, habitat, and ecological niches (symbiont taxonomic dimension integrated with host taxonomic and functional dimensions); 3) the extent of codiversification for ~10 core, host-specific symbiont lineages, and the impacts of host phylogeny, geography, and ecology on symbiont transfer (symbiont taxonomic dimension integrated with host taxonomic and functional dimensions); 4) variation in genome evolution and innovation across symbionts with varying degrees of codiversification, and across genes with varying function (taxonomic, genetic, and functional integration of hosts and symbionts); and 5) symbiont function in light of symbiont genome evolution, host-symbiont codiversification, and host phylogeny, geography, and ecology (taxonomic, genetic, and functional integration of hosts and symbionts)."
506490,"Biologists are deluged with sequence data yet have derived comparatively little biological information from it. The accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life, but experimentally determining what each protein does is costly and difficult, and cannot scale up to accommodate the vast amount of sequence data already available. Therefore discovering protein protein function by computational, rather than experimental means, is of primary importance. Genomic sequence data are available from thousands of species, and those are coupled with massive high-throughput experimental data. Together, these data have created new opportunities as well as challenges for computational function prediction. As a result, many computational annotation methods have been developed by research groups worldwide, but their accuracy and applicability need to be improved upon. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG) is to bring together computational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators who are dealing with the important problem of predicting protein function, to share ideas, and create collaborations. To improve computational function prediction methods, the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) was established as an ongoing experiment. CAFA was designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function. By challenging dozens of research groups worldwide to develop and provide their best software for function prediction, the researchers involved in the AFP-SIG will improve the ability of biologists to understand life at the molecular level. The AFP-SIG researchers will also generate experimental data from fruit-flies, fungi and bacteria to be used as benchmarks to test the software participating in CAFA, and a deeper understanding of these model organisms. <br/><br/>It is now possible to collect data that comprehensively profile many different states of complex biological systems. Using these data it should be possible to understand and explain the underlying systems, but significant challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is that, as researchers collect more data from many different organisms in many different systems, they discover more and different genes. Assigning functions to these newly discovered genes represents a key step towards interpretation of high-throughput data. This leads to a critical need to assess the quality of the function prediction methods that researchers have developed in recent years. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG), founded in 2005, is to bring together bioinformaticians and biologists who are addressing this key challenge of gene function prediction. In addition to sharing ideas and creating collaboration, AFP-SIG has created CAFA: the Critical Assessment of (protein) Function Annotation. CAFA is a community-driven challenge to assess the performance of protein function prediction software, and it has been carried out twice since 2010. The investigators will provide the following outcomes: (1) robust open-source software to be used in function prediction and assessment of function prediction methods, incorporated into the high-profile annotation pipelines of UniProt-GOA; (2) expansion of the AFP community by engaging bioinformaticians, biocurators and experimentalists, thereby improving the quality and relevance of function prediction methods; (3) large-scale experimental screens in Drosophila, Candida and Pseudomonas for novel associations of targeted functional terms with genes; (4) an expanded CAFA event, incorporating both the curated annotations from the literature and our own experimental screens, in the last two years of the project. The progress of the AFP-SIG and CAFA will be available from http://BioFunctionPrediction.org"
607600,"HEWS LAY Abstract proposal IOS- 1052247 <br/><br/>Most animals have complex sets of characteristics (traits) used in communication. A blue-colored signaling patch of skin, for example, requires the animals have an eye that is sensitive to blue wavelengths of light. Mechanisms integrating sets of correlated traits are not well-studied, and comparatively little is known about the physiological bases of these complex correlations, and how mechanisms may vary across species. The project will detail such mechanisms underlying correlated traits, and how they may be ""pulled apart? evolutionarily, by studying twelve closely-related lizard species in the genus Sceloporus (fence lizards), in which there are repeated origins of a specific novel communicative trait. Studies of physiological and genetic mechanisms related to the co-evolution of visual and chemical communication will assess traits involved in both signal production (e.g., chemical components of secretions; skin cells producing color; hormone controllers) and signal reception (e.g., color-sensitivity of the eye; chemical sensitivity of the sensory tissues in the nasal region) . The PIs will also develop statistical methods needed to analyze data on correlated traits when the study species are closely related. The resulting software enabling such statistical analyses will be made freely available online for other researchers. There are diverse broader impacts. First, undergraduate and graduate student will be trained by and will collaborate with researchers in biochemistry, molecular biology, neurophysiology, animal behavior, evolutionary biology, and biostatistics. Second, funding will enhance infrastructure for research and education by facilitating collaborations between scientists in different disciplines and institutions in the US, and also in Mexico where many of the study species occur. Third, the PIs will enhance scientific and technological understanding of the public by collaborating with two Indiana science museums to establish displays based on the project, and by connecting research outcomes with ongoing outreach activities with local K-12 science teachers."
928134,"Chalcidoidea (jewel wasps) are among the most species rich, ecologically important, and biologically diverse groups of terrestrial organisms. Their diversity is staggering, with more than 500,000 species thought to exist. These minute wasps (mostly 1-2 mm in size) are numerically abundant and common in almost every habitat. The smallest of these wasps are smaller than a typical single-celled organism, and yet the adults can fly, locate their hosts, deposit their eggs, and as larvae, consume their insect hosts. Most chalcidoid wasps are parasitoids; they feed on their insect hosts, eventually killing them. A few groups have also evolved to attack plant hosts and some serve as pollinators. Species attack all life stages from eggs to adults, and live and feed either internally or externally. Some are parasitoids of other parasitoids and some may even feed on their own species. Because they kill other insects, these wasps are extremely important for the control of pests of agricultural and forest crops, as well as vectors of human disease and veterinary pests. The economic importance of these wasps in pest management is unparalleled. They are widely used in biological control programs against major pests, with outcomes documented to result in decreases in pesticide, increases in yield, and in landmark cases direct savings of billions of dollars or permanent pest control. The evolutionary events leading to this enormous diversity in morphology, biology and rates of diversification are poorly understood, leading to an artificial system of taxonomic classification. In this research project, researchers will use a diverse array of molecular, morphological and bioinformatics approaches to develop a solid understanding of the hierarchy of relationships across the entire group. These relationships will then be used to reclassify major groups to reflect common ancestry, to provide a framework for a web-accessible portal to manage and deliver information on their diverse biology, and to explore the evolutionary changes that have driven and shaped this enormous radiation of terrestrial insects.<br/><br/>The objectives of the research project are to 1) generate a robust molecular phylogeny of the Chalcidoidea using new data from transcriptomes and targeted DNA enrichment for over 400 species, 2) generate morphological data for over 200 fossils from Eocene and Cretaceous amber and combine these with a comprehensive morphological data set for extant taxa, 3) develop a revised classification of Chalcidoidea in book form through a series of workshops and worldwide collaborations, and 4) make available information on the taxonomy, biology and distribution of over 31,000 available names and information in over 40,000 references. The project will train two postdoctoral researchers, one graduate student and several undergraduates. To involve the wider scientific community, a worldwide group of biocontrol researchers and taxonomists will develop a new classification for Chalcidoidea. With groups of Research and Extension Specialists, the project will develop posters, fliers, specimen education kits, and other educational materials for use in the classroom and by extension specialists, agricultural advisors, master naturalists and master gardeners, and the general public to develop a greater interest and understanding of this charismatic and and important group of insects."
649967,"Mutualisms, cooperative interactions among species, are among the most widespread species interactions on earth. From tiny fungi that harvest nutrients for their plant partners, to large mammals that disperse the seeds of forest trees, to the pollinators that maintain global agricultural productivity, mutualistic partnerships play a central role in the global economy and the maintenance of biological diversity. A key unresolved question is, how do these interactions remain cooperative when natural selection should favor selfish individuals who reap benefits without paying the costs of cooperation? Studies addressing this question typically calculate the costs and benefits of interacting with a given partner species independent of an individual's life stage and interactions with other partner species. But natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and many mutualists interact with multiple partners species throughout their lives. Evaluating how the costs and benefits of multiple partnerships integrate over the lifetime of mutualists is a critical link in understanding how these globally important interactions evolve and function. Focusing on a multi-species ant-plant (Acacia) mutualism found throughout East Africa, this study seeks to evaluate how the costs and benefits of mutualism change with variation in the life-stage of interacting partner species, and how the net fitness effects of multiple interactions change with variation in the timing, duration and sequence of plant partnerships with different ant species. The results will shed light on how this model mutualism remains cooperative, and what factors can precipitate its breakdown. <br/><br/>This research will also involve the development of four synergistic educational objectives aimed at engaging U.S. and African undergraduate students, K-12 students, and the general public. The program will develop a month-long field program that directly engages U.S. undergraduate students in original research and experiential learning, and allow for the training of exceptional undergraduates in the ecology of mutualism from both plant and animal perspectives. In addition, by partnering with an African collaborator, the program will bring 25 Kenyan K-12 students to the field site each year to learn about the natural history of East Africa, using the ant-Acacia system to actively engage kids in the process of scientific discovery."
820000,"The tree of life links all biodiversity through a shared evolutionary history. This project will produce the first online, comprehensive first-draft tree of all 1.8 million named species, accessible to both the public and scientific communities. Assembly of the tree will incorporate previously published results, with strong collaborations between computational and empirical biologists to develop, test and improve methods of data synthesis. This initial tree of life will not be static; instead, we will develop tools for scientists to update and revise the tree as new data come in. Early release of the tree and tools will motivate data sharing and facilitate ongoing synthesis of knowledge.<br/><br/>Biological research of all kinds, including studies of ecological health, environmental change, and human disease, increasingly depends on knowing how species are related to each other. Yet there is no single resource that unites knowledge of the tree of life. Instead, only small parts of the tree are individually available, generally as printed figures in journal articles. This project will provide the global community of scientists who study the tree of life with a means to share and combine their results, and will enable large-scale studies of Earth's biodiversity. It will also create a resource where students, educators and citizens can go to explore and learn about life's evolutionary history."
501433,"This project investigates how the biodiversity of one of the world's most important groups of freshwater fishes evolved. Containing tetras, piranhas and many other popular aquarium fishes, order Characiformes represents one of the most diverse groups of fishes on the planet, but some of its families include species of many varying shapes, sizes and diets, while others include numerous species with similar habitats, food sources and anatomies. Why are some groups more diverse than others? How do its many species fit together on their family tree? How do a dozen or more ecologically similar species coexist in a single river? This project will tackle such questions by assembling a comprehensive tree-of-life for the very diverse characiform superfamily Anostomoidea (headstanders and relatives) using traditional DNA analysis, study of skeletal anatomy, and a new genomic approach. Then, that tree-of-life will serve as a framework with which to investigate the evolution of anatomical and ecological biodiversity.<br/><br/>Overall, this project synthesizes the expertise and genetic resources of two countries to forge an enduring international collaboration and reconstruct the evolutionary history of some of the most intriguing South American fishes with precision and detail that would be impossible if the labs were to work alone. It draws on diverse human capital in the US and in Brazil, including the author of previous evolutionary studies on these fishes, one of Brazil?s leading fish geneticists, an expert on taxonomy, a leader in genomics and macroevolution, and students in both countries. Other broader impacts include the involvement of undergraduate students in research and outreach, development of a DNA-barcode library and interactive online identification key, sponsorship of graduate students at a training workshop and active participation in the Smithsonian's ""The Scientist is In"" program, which brings the public into direct contact with museum-affiliated researchers and specimens."
690000,"Intellectual Merit. The overall goal of this project is to increase understanding of the mechanisms that govern genetic recombination in mammalian chromosomes. The term ""genetic recombination"" refers to a process in which segments of DNA are exchanged between two chromosomal regions. Recombination plays an important role in the evolution of genomes, contributes to genetic diversity, and provides a means for repair of DNA damage that occurs on a daily basis. Although recombination is generally beneficial, it may be viewed as a double-edged sword. While recombination helps to maintain the integrity of chromosomes, it is critical that mechanisms exist to assure that exchanges are allowed to occur only between appropriate chromosomal regions so that potentially deleterious genetic rearrangements are avoided. For the most part, recombination must be restricted to DNA segments that share a high degree of identity in order for deleterious exchanges to be precluded, but little is known about how cells regulate recombination. In this research project, a novel set of engineered DNA molecules will be inserted into chromosomes in mouse cells, and these molecules will allow recombination events to be monitored. The various DNA molecules are designed to test the cell's ability to carry out recombination between DNA segments sharing different degrees of identity. These studies will illuminate the rules normally employed to decide which DNA segments can engage in recombination, and which DNA segments are excluded from such exchanges. Also to be investigated is the question of whether certain forms of DNA damage might alter the rules of recombination. The roles played by certain proteins in the regulation of recombination will also be explored. This project will provide a clearer picture of how recombination can both shape and maintain the mammalian genome.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This project will make substantive contributions to general science education and practical scientific training. The research will be conducted in a laboratory that is located in a large undergraduate Department of Biological Sciences that is responsible for educating more than 1600 undergraduate majors. The laboratory in which this work will be done has a history of offering research experiences for undergraduates and this project will continue this history. It is noteworthy that the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of South Carolina has a very diverse student body, and so this project will afford an important opportunity for providing research experiences for traditionally underrepresented groups. In the past, this project's Principal Investigator (PI) has served as mentor to African American and women undergraduates, and these research experiences have encouraged several individuals to choose careers in science. The PI has also served as mentor to numerous masters and doctoral degree students from the U.S. and abroad and this research project will continue this important training of new scientists. Several Historically Black Colleges and Universities are within proximity to the University of South Carolina. The PI will visit these institutions to present scientific seminars reporting the results of the funded work and will use such engagements to talk with students about graduate school opportunities and the possibility of pursuing a career in science. The PI will also visit with students in grades K-12 to discuss career opportunities in science, research results, and general issues related to science. In addition to potentially encouraging careers in science, these latter outreach activities may serve to enhance the scientific literacy of the public."
725000,"Ecosystems are extremely complex entities generated and maintained through the interactions of numerous abiotic and biotic factors. While many ecosystems have been characterized based on overall ecosystem function, the role of microorganisms is often overlooked or oversimplified due to technical and conceptual challenges. This oversimplification has resulted in ecological models that do not accurately account for the impacts of biodiversity on ecosystem function during periods of environmental change. Given that the global microbiome is the largest biological reservoir on Earth and forms the foundation of all ecosystems, it is critically important to better understand how environmental factors trigger changes in microbial community structure and function and how these changes impact overall ecosystem function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will utilize technological developments in high throughput metagenomic and metatranscriptomic DNA sequencing to examine microbes in a lagoon ecosystem over temporal scales following environmental perturbations. The objectives of this study are to understand the environmental cues that trigger taxonomic shifts (e.g. from rare to dominant), to examine the functional redundancy within rare and abundant taxa, and to explore the link between community gene expression and taxon-level traits and overall ecosystem function. <br/><br/>Results from this study will help refine ecosystem models by defining the links between microbial taxonomic and functional gene diversity, environmental factors, and rates of ecosystem processes. Furthermore, by understanding the role of microbial diversity in the resilience of microbial mat communities in the lagoons, results from the proposed studies may have a transformative impact on ecosystem science and evolutionary biology. As a means of integrating cutting edge science into education, a strong university, community, and international-level outreach program will be developed to: (1) enhance graduate education by developing a new molecular microbial ecology course; (2) enhance undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc laboratory and field experiences; (3) provide local high school students and teachers with lab and field-based experiences by the expansion of a previous NSF-supported Young Genomic Scientists Program; (4) enhance environmental awareness of the general public by generating a microbial mat exhibit to be displayed at the nationally-renowned EdVenture Children?s Museum (>200,000 visitors per year); and (5) enhance ecosystem awareness of Bahamian children and science teachers."
683793,"The lack of a reliable family tree for the extraordinarily diverse beetle family Curculionidae (true weevils) has impeded taxonomic, systematic and applied research on weevils. This project will reconstruct the family tree of Curculionidae and establish a timeframe for weevil diversification by analyzing genomic and morphological (anatomical) data. The genomic data gathered will consist of DNA sequences from 1,000 species representing all major groups of weevils, obtained via an approach called anchored phylogenomics. This will be one of the first applications of this new method for gathering phylogenomic data in insects.<br/><br/>Curculionidae contains >51,000 named species and is one of the largest families of animals on Earth. Because of their intimate and often highly specialized interactions with plants and fungi, Curculionidae are among the most significant pests of agriculture and forestry worldwide, and some of the most abundant insects on Earth. This project will clarify the interrelationships of all major groups of weevils for the first time. The resulting family trees will be used to test long-standing hypotheses about weevil relationships and evolution, and will contribute to resolving the taxonomic problems that both pervade the internal higher classification of weevils and impede research on economically and ecologically important weevil species."
546474,"Ceraphronoidea are small, under-studied parasitoid wasps whose larvae feed on and eventually kill other insects. Many species of Ceraphronoidea are important in biological pest control programs in agricultural systems. Ceraphronoidea also appear to be the missing link that is critical for our understanding of the evolution of Hymenoptera, a lineage of insects represented by more than a million species (10% of all organisms). This project will result in broadly accessible resources that lift barriers to future research on these insects, including: a phylogeny based on molecular and anatomical data, a revised higher-level classification, images of specimens, data for tens of thousands of specimens, species-level monographs for agriculturally-relevant groups, and robust tools that use molecular and anatomical data for identification of species. <br/><br/>The project will also test a novel approach for describing species. This new method increases the openness and accessibility of biodiversity data and allows one to do analyses of color, texture, shape, and other phenotypes in order to look for ecological patterns and to assist in diagnosing species. The approach is broadly applicable and stands to connect data from taxonomic treatments of any organism, a first for taxonomy. A workshop in contemporary morphology methods will facilitate training and dissemination of this new approach. Two graduate students will be trained as integrative systematists and experts of Ceraphronoidea, the first in over a decade."
834828,"Extracting biological knowledge from complex datasets such as those now being compiled requires integration of powerful computational tools. Recent developments in computational biology as well as rich new data sources provide novel opportunities for integrating massive amounts of biological data. This perfect storm of new data and advanced data acquisition, management, and integration afford the unique opportunity to drive the discovery of new, complex patterns in biology. The project will leverage NSF's considerable investment in biodiversity tools provided by Open Tree of Life (the framework for the project), Lifemapper (which handles geospatial data), iDigBio (data from ~1 billion museum specimens that carry locality data and their ecological information), and Arbor (computer tools that permit new analyses from the sources noted). It will create much needed computational connections among these tools. It will then build upon these new linkages and tools, enabling novel research in biodiversity. These linkages will provide researchers the opportunity to rapidly synthesize datasets and use them to address diverse evolutionary questions. The tools and infrastructure the project will build will connect species relationships with species distribution models, climate projections, genes and traits. The project will transform future studies of biodiversity; it will provide a global integration of powerful tools that will permit new data-driven discovery in ""next generation"" biodiversity science. It will provide interdisciplinary post-doc and graduate student training in bioinformatics, use of digitized specimen data, and complex analyses (e.g. ecological analyses), preparing the biodiversity scientists of the future. The project will recruit underrepresented students and women and develop an undergrad course that will help train students with the integrative skills (field biology to computational biology) needed in the workforce. We will further develop this module for wider classroom use. We will introduce an annual week-long course at University of Florida (UF) for students and post-docs on the use of the resources developed. With education specialists at UF, the project will produce video materials and a coordinated display for general audiences on the importance of digitized specimen data, and their utility for studies of climate change. <br/><br/>The project will develop a computational framework linking diverse data (trees of species relationships, morphology, ecology, fossils, geography, and climate) across research tools used by the biological community, including Open Tree of Life, which will serve as the framework to which all other biological data - traits, genes, genomes, and especially specimens - will be linked, as well as Lifemapper, iDigBio, and Arbor. Use of the large, hyper-diverse plant group Saxifragales will provide precisely what is needed to drive the development of these tools--a comprehensive dataset that covers morphology, ecology, geography, fossils, and climate provides a test case for refining the tools the project will develop and their integration. The project will: 1. Facilitate new synergistic research of broad utility at the interface of phylogenetics, ecology, evolutionary biology, biogeography and biodiversity science, enabling scientists to address novel questions relating phenotypic and ecological biodiversity, spatial and temporal variation, community assembly, and diversification across landscapes and through time. 2. Increase visibility and accessibility of iDigBio, Open Tree of Life, Arbor, and Lifemapper resources by linking them together and making them available through multiple access points (e.g., pre-existing tools associated with Arbor and Lifemapper) in a variety of appropriate formats. 3. Develop a complete, multifaceted species-level dataset for a large clade (Saxifragales), which will not only fill in this branch on the ToL, but will produce a resource of great utility for the scientific community to explore. 4. Demonstrate the utility of iDigBio, Open Tree, Lifemapper, and Arbor resources with a comprehensive analysis using near complete sampling of Saxifragales, for which we will add the following data layers: DNA sequences, morphology, fossils, ontologies, geospatial and environmental data, digitized voucher specimens, and link to the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). The project will: 1) provide interdisciplinary post-doc and graduate student training in bioinformatics, large-scale phylogeny reconstruction, use of digitized specimen data, and complex post-tree analyses (e.g. niche modeling, niche diversification), preparing the integrative biodiversity scientists of the future; 2) recruit underrepresented students and women; 3) developed an undergrad course that uses field collection, herbarium specimens, digitized data (iDigBio), and niche modeling (with climate change; 4) introduce an annual week-long course (UF) for students and post-docs on the use of the resources produced; 5) produce video materials and a coordinated display for general audiences on the importance of digitized specimen data, their utility for modeling niche evolution through time and implications for climate change. The project will provide a platform that will enable other researchers to take the same integrated approach in other groups. It will also establish web links to EOL and 1) build species pages; 2) place morphological and other trait data on TraitBank, making these widely available; 3) work with EOL and iNaturalist to engage citizen scientists."
774785,"Co-PIs: Natalia Dudareva (Purdue University), Sarah O'Connor (John Innes Centre, UK), Douglas Soltis (University of Florida), Pamela Soltis (University of Florida)<br/><br/>The sixth largest flowering plant family, the Lamiaceae or mint family, is the source of many familiar mint and culinary flavors enjoyed by people worldwide. Many members of the mint family produce so-called secondary metabolites, which are by-products of plant chemistry that impart the familiar flavors of peppermint or spearmint in herbal teas or savory culinary seasoning from oregano, basil, lavender and other herbs. Human appreciation and consumption of these botanical compounds supports a growing agronomic industry, with the market for peppermint and spearmint oil alone worth over $200 million in 2011 (USDA); and yet how and why the underlying chemistry of these compounds evolved in the family is unknown. This project studies the chemical pathways required to synthesize flavor compounds using genome sequencing and by identifying all the relevant factors produced in each species. By comparing the resulting large datasets across family members, the project will clarify how such chemical processes evolved in plants. The interdisciplinary nature of the project requires the participation of experts in biochemistry, genomics, genetics and evolutionary biology. In turn, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students are trained at the frontiers of science by learning cutting edge genomics research that links directly to products of economic value. Through collaboration with the Michigan State University 4H Children's Garden and the Florida Museum of Natural History, the project offers informative displays and tours so the public can become citizen scientists as they learn about the evolution and underlying ""flavor"" chemistry of the familiar and much appreciated mint family. <br/><br/>The Lamiaceae represents a large family of angiosperms with a high degree of chemical diversity. The major subfamilies within the Lamiaceae, the Lamioideae and Nepetoideae, can be readily distinguished morphologically and also show qualitative and quantitative differences in the synthesis of two key specialized compounds, iridoids and volatile monoterpenoids. These compounds play an essential role in plant reproduction, defense, and signaling and are also the source of mint and other herbal flavors for human consumption. This project integrates genomic, metabolite, phylogenetic, and functional datasets to investigate the evolution of the monoterpene and iridoid biosynthetic pathways in the Lamiaceae. In the first phase, the transcriptomes and metabolomes of a phylogenetically diverse panel of 50 species will be generated and analyzed to identify a robust set of 14 species for focused study. In the second phase, full genome sequencing, expression, and metabolite levels will be conducted on the selected set, thus providing resources to (1) identify specific genes involved in monoterpene and iridoid biosynthesis, (2) elucidate key evolutionary events and mechanisms that led to the extant chemical diversity represented in the Lamiaceae, and (3) functionally test hypotheses about how variation in biosynthetic pathway genes contribute to chemical diversity. All resources from the project, including genome, transcriptome sequences and metabolite information will be publicly available through publications, the NCBI sequence archives, the Dryad Digital Repository and posted on a project website hosted at Michigan State University."
